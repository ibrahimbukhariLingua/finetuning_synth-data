In addition to his journalism and speaking engagements, Epstein has authored books on economic policy and has contributed to a variety of academic and popular publications.


## Career

Epstein earned a BA from Brandeis University and an MA in economics from the New School. He taught economics at St. John's University and the City University of New York. He wrote a book called *Making Money in Commodities* in 1976 and later worked as a senior economist for the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1993 he became economics editor and columnist of "Economic Beat" for *Barron's Magazine*. His book, *Econospinning,* was published in 2006. The book was met with some controversy in the blogosphere after Tyler Cowen mentioned it in his blog Marginal Revolution.

He now runs a monthly debate series called The Soho Forum, which "features topics of special interest to libertarians and aims to enhance social and professional ties within the NYC libertarian community." In its most widely viewed debate, Gene himself debated Richard D. Wolff on the issues of socialism and capitalism. As of February 2025, the recording of the debate has been viewed over 7 million times.
