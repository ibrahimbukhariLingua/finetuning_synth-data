## Work


### Creating New Market Space

In their 1997 Harvard Business Review article "Value Innovation" Kim and Renée Mauborgne presented a popular post-Porter model. In this article they described a "value innovation" model in which companies must look outside their present paradigms to find new value propositions.

Their approach complements most of Michael Porter's thinking, especially the concept of differentiation. They later went on to publish their ideas in the book *Blue Ocean Strategy*. Thus it is difficult, but not impossible, to topple a firm that has established a dominant standard.


### Blue Ocean Strategy

Blue Ocean Strategy is a business strategy book first published in 2005 and written by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne of The Blue Ocean Strategy Institute at INSEAD. The book illustrates what the authors believe is the best organizational strategy to generate growth and profits. Blue Ocean Strategy suggests that an organization should create new demand in an uncontested market space, or a "Blue Ocean", rather than compete head-to-head with other suppliers in an existing industry.
