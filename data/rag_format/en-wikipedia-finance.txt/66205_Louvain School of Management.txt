## History

The Louvain School of Management was founded in 1897 under the name "école des sciences commerciales et consulaires" as a department of UCLouvain. In 1972 it became the "Institut d'Administration et de Gestion" (lAG), under the Faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences and Communication.

In 1989 the School started to offer a systematic exchange program. It is a member since 1989 of the CEMS network and since 1990 of the PIM network. It is also affiliated through the University to a large number of international corporate, research and education networks such as CLUSTER or COIMBRA.

In 2005 it became an autonomous part of UCLouvain and started to brand itself internationally as the Louvain School of Management. In 2006 it launched its International executive MBA. It became an independent faculty in 2010.

In 2011, LSM merged with the department of management of the Facultés universitaires catholiques de Mons (now UCLouvain FUCaM Mons). So far, LSM is operating on three campuses: Louvain-la-Neuve, Mons and Charleroi. Negotiations for a full merger with two other universities, the Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix (FUNDP) located in Namur and the Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis (FUSL) located in Brussels, were halted in 2012, however the latter (UCLouvain Saint-Louis - Bruxelles) has de facto integrated UCLouvain in 2018, fully merged by September 2023.
