Purchase, New York


# Purchase, New York



**Purchase** is a hamlet in the town and village of Harrison, in Westchester County, New York, United States. One myth explains that its name is derived from Harrison's purchase, where John Harrison was to be granted as much land as he could ride in one day. Purchase is home to State University of New York at Purchase and Manhattanville College and is one of the richest communities on the east coast.


## History

In 1695, John Harrison, a Quaker from Flushing, Queens, "purchased of the Indians a tract of land about nine miles in length and nearly three in width... The Indians reserved 'such whitewood trees as shall be found suitable to make canoes of..." Large numbers of Friends came to settle there. They called it "Harrison's Purchase," or simply "The Purchase" and it is still known today as Purchase, NY. A Quaker meeting house was erected there in 1727.

In 1967, 200 residents stated support for a plan to incorporate Purchase so corporations could not build in the community. In response, officials from the Town of Harrison put forward plans to try to become a city in an attempt to stop Purchase from seceding from the Town of Harrison.

There are many historic sites located in Purchase. The grounds that SUNY Purchase now occupies was once Strathglass Farms, a dairy farm. The Quaker Friends Meeting house was founded in the 18th century. The original building fell victim to fire years ago and the present one is an accurate reconstruction. Before the headquarters of Pepsi was built, the Blind Brook Polo Club was located on that site. Amelia Earhart flew her plane from the polo grounds. Many colonial era homes and unspoiled natural woodlands have decreased in the last 30 years due to residential development. The Old Oaks Country Club, originally named 'Hill Crest', is a splendid mansion house built in the late 1880s by millionaire Trenor Luther Park and his wife Julia Catlin Park. Trenor Luther was a Harvard Graduate, who studied law, and a silk merchant. His father, Trenor William Park, funded the Panama Railway, ran for Vice President of the United States in 1864 and was involved with the California Gold Mines. Purchase is also known for being one of the richest areas in the country.

The Reid Hall, Manhattanville College was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.
