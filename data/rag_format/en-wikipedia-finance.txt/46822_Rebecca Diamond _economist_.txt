## Biography

Diamond is the daughter of Elizabeth Cammack Diamond and Douglas Diamond, recipient of the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

She graduated from Yale University in 2007 with a BS in Physics and Economics & Mathematics, worked for a year as an analyst for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and then began graduate study at Harvard University. She earned an MA in Economics in 2011 and a PhD in Economics in 2013, and has been at Stanford University since then.


## Research

Diamond's research focuses on topics in housing and inequality, including gender gaps in gig work, affordable housing development, and the geography of consumption inequality. Her work combines theoretical modeling with empirical analysis using new datasets, and often involves the connections between housing markets and labor markets. In work receiving media coverage, she studied a rent control policy implemented in San Francisco in 1994, finding that this policy reduced the amount of rental housing eligible for the policy as landlords sold rent-controlled apartments for condominium-conversions and replaced rent-controlled apartments with new buildings not covered by the policy.
