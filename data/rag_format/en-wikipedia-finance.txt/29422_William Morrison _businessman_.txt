# William Morrison (businessman)



**William Murdoch Morrison** (19 July 1878 â€“ 3 August 1956) was the English founder of the business which would, after his death, become the Morrisons supermarket chain.


## Career

Brought up in Bradford, West Yorkshire, William Morrison started selling eggs and butter on a wholesale basis in 1899. Shortly afterwards he opened a stall in Bradford and then others in nearby towns. He opened his first proper stores in the 1920s - but still only in the Bradford area. This then became Morrisons.

His son Ken Morrison took over as chairman in 1956 following William's death.
