Bull reported from Iraq following the start of the insurgency in the spring of 2004.

In the October 2007 issue of *Prospect Magazine*, Bull argued that the Coalition's mission in Iraq has been accomplished. With most Sunni factions now seeking a deal he claims the big questions in Iraq have been resolved positively. The country remains one, it has embraced the ballot box and avoided all-out civil war. He says that what violence remains is largely local and criminal. American troops will leave Iraq, Bull wrote, only "when the Iraqis, through their elected leadership, tell them to".

Bull is a founder of Northern Gulf Partners, an Iraq-focused investment firm. At Northern Gulf, Bull, "an emerging markets fund manager," helped to establish and operate Iraq Investment Partners I, the world's first Iraq-only public securities investment fund.

Bull's Showtime documentary feature film "Cradle of Champions" premiered at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 2017 and won the critics' and audience awards at the Manchester (UK) International Film Festival. The film has been praised as "a new standard for character-driven narrative documentary... the envy of any feature filmmaker." Reviews have been positive: "the nail-biting excitement of a fictional boxing movie like RAGING BULL… both a stirring sports doc and a rich nonfiction drama, populated by characters who could have stepped out of a Damon Runyon story" … "real life with cinematic beauty" … "sensational" … "an astounding success" … "a great film… a film that I want to see again and again.... Bartle Bull hasn't just made a documentary, he has made a grand narrative that mirrors the mythic tales of antiquity" … "compelling" … "very, very powerful" … "robustly made… about New York and the way it sees itself: tough, big-hearted, assimilated and patriotic."

Bull is a former director of the Longview Foundation and sits on the Visiting Committee of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. He holds an A.B. from Harvard University (1993) and an M.B.A. from Columbia University (2000).

Bull and his wife Claudia live in Dutchess County, NY with two young children.
