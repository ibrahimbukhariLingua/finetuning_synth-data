**Chemins de fer de la Corse** (French pronunciation: [ʃəmɛ̃ də fɛʁ də la kɔʁs], **CFC**; Corsican: *Camini di Ferru di a Corsica*) is the name of the regional rail network serving the French island of Corsica. It is centred on the town of Ponte Leccia, from which three main lines radiate to Ajaccio, Bastia, and Calvi. The section following the northwest coastline between L'Île-Rousse and Calvi, known as the Balagne line, gives access to many beaches and is very popular with tourists.

A fourth line, running from Casamozza (on the Bastia line) down the east coast of the island to Porto-Vecchio was badly damaged by bombardment during World War II and never reopened.


## History

In 1877 it was decided to build a metre-gauge railway in Corsica, despite the very difficult terrain it would have to cross. Legislation was passed on 4 August 1879 for the construction of the railway. The first lines opened on 1 August 1888 between Bastia and Corte and also between Ajaccio and Bocognano. The network was gradually opened in sections until 1894. A line to Porto-Vecchio opened in stages, the final section opening in 1935, but this was to be short lived owing to the war. There were proposals to build lines from Ajaccio to Propriano and also from Porto Vecchio to Bonifacio, but these lines were not built.

In 1955, there was a proposal to close the Calvi – Ponte-Leccia line; and in 1959 another proposal to close the whole network, which was successfully opposed by the railway workers and the citizens of Corsica. In 1972, another proposal for closure was fought off.


## Network

With a length of 232 kilometres (144 mi), the network is composed of two lines, both single track:

* Ajaccio–Bastia via Ponte-Leccia and Corte, 158 kilometres (98 mi);
* Calvi–Ponte Leccia via L'Île-Rousse, 74 kilometres (46 mi).

A third line of 130 kilometres (81 mi), opened between 1888 and 1935, served the east coast; it linked Casamozza to Porto-Vecchio. After suffering much damage during World War II in September 1943, it was never restored, although the section between Casamozza and Folleli remained open until 1953. The track of the disused line, between Casamozza and Moriani, at 42°31′N 9°26′E﻿ / ﻿42.517°N 9.433°E﻿ / 42.517; 9.433, is being considered for reopening.

The island's geography and topography has forced the line to follow it. The network has 32 tunnels and 51 bridges and viaducts. The longest tunnel, at 3.9 kilometres (2.4 mi), is near Vizzavona. This tunnel is also the highest on the network, at 906 metres (2,972 ft) high. The viaduct at Vecchio, 140 metres (459 ft) long and 94 metres (308 ft 5 in) high, was designed by Gustave Eiffel.

The CFC is the only metre gauge line in France carrying freight. One train a day operates over the Ajaccio-Bastia line. In winter, the Vizzavona pass is often blocked, and closed to road traffic. Most of the goods wagons are today used for track maintenance purposes.


## Stations


## Ownership

The network is owned by the government of France and not by Réseau Ferré de France. The Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, CTC, is the concessionary holder of the network, under the act of parliament on regionalisation of railways in France, and is the transport authority and regulator of railway services. The CTC has entrusted the SNCF with the operation of rail services since 1 January 1983. A nine-year agreement between these bodies under the *Loi Sapin* came into effect on 1 September 2001.

A modernisation plan agreed by the national government, the CTC and the SNCF envisages the investment of 110 million euros. These funds are to be allocated to the modernisation of rolling stock and infrastructure, thus reducing travel time. An extension of the network towards the airports at Bastia and Ajaccio is also envisaged.


## Rolling stock

## Service

Service is essentially composed of passenger trains. It is divided into different activities:

* Inter-urban services:
 + Four return journeys between Bastia and Ajaccio (158 km, travel time 3 hours 25 minutes)
 + One return journey between Bastia and Calvi (120 km, travel time 2 hours 44 minutes)
 + Three return journeys between Ponte Leccia and la Balagne, of which two terminate short at l'Île-Rousse where an interchange exists with the **Tramway de la Balagne**.
* Frequent suburban services:
 + Between Bastia and Casamozza (21 km) and nicknamed the Bastia métro. Twenty stations are served in 30 minutes.
 + Between Calvi and l'Île-Rousse (22 km) and nicknamed **Tramway de la Balagne**. Eighteen stations are served in 50 minutes. Frequent service is provided throughout Summer with a reduced service in the Winter season.

Goods traffic amounts to less than 1000 tons per annum.
