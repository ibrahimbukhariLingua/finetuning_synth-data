He subsequently joined Lehman Brothers, where he worked on structured financing. In 1998, he joined Morgan Stanley, where he started Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and was Chief Executive Officer of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure.

The group manages over $40 billion in assets, including a commitment from the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation to invest in Southeast Asia.

I Squared Capital's portfolio companies employ over 66,000 professionals.


### Infrastructure advocacy

Wahba is known as an advocate for increased investment in infrastructure both to address public needs and as a tool to create sustainable economic growth. He argues that infrastructure investment is capable of stimulating economic growth while also providing tangible benefits to the public and the environment.

He cites the 2021 Texas power crisis as an example of the "crisis" caused by long-term under-investment in domestic infrastructure and neglect. In addition to tax-funded investment, Wahba proposes additional infrastructure investment sources including pension funds, the creation of an infrastructure IRA, overseas capital and the establishment of a public-private infrastructure bank.

Wahba writes frequently about infrastructure issues. His articles advocating greater investment in infrastructure and increased use of private investment include "Can the Private Sector Bring About the 'Greening' of Infrastructure" (Forbes), "US Infra Funding Needs More Than Just a Tax Hike", "The U.S. Needs an Infrastructure Bank That Models the World Bank" (The Hill), "Biden's Billion-Dollar Infrastructure Plan Needs a Dedicated IRA to Pay for It" (Miami Herald), "Pension Funds Can Launch a New Infrastructure Era" (Pensions & Investments), "A Three-Step Action Plan to Save US Infrastructure" (Infrastructure Investor) and "Upgrading our Crumbling Infrastructure Could Recession-Proof Our Nation" (Miami Herald).

Wahba is a published author on economic research, including articles in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, Review of Economics and Statistics as well as other publications and proceedings, in addition to the book *Build:Investing in America's Infrastructure*. One of his publications was selected by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as one of its 50 most influential papers in the last 50 years. His research at Harvard included labor migration and worker remittances as a source of foreign capital to emerging markets.

He has appeared frequently on Bloomberg, CNBC, Nasdaq, Yahoo! Finance, TD Ameritrade and Cheddar.

He is a member of the President's Infrastructure Advisory Council.
