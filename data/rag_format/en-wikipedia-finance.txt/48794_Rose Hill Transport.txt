## History

In 1952 entrepreneur Juggarnath Goburdhun purchased his first bus when he was based at Forest Side. By 1954 the entrepreneur had founded Rose Hill Transport Limited in alliance with other bus operators to service the transportation needs of passengers between Rose-Hill and Port-Louis. His close associates were Michael Leal, France Maugueret, Goolam Mamode Kureeman et Ng Kiam Sin. The company grew its original fleet of 5 buses of the 1950s to a fleet of 90 buses which operates along 12 routes which transports 30,000 passengers daily.

In 1962 Rose Hill Transport made history by introducing the first double decker bus in Mauritius and the launch was celebrated at a banquet feast hosted at Plaza in Rose Hill which was attended by Sir Harold E. Walter who was the chief guest and Minister of Transport. The 1975 students' protest and 1971 workers strikes affected the business.

In 1992 Sanjiv Goburdhun became the managing director of the organisation. By mid 1990s the company started its restructure, and its original name **Rose Hill Transport Limited** became RHT Holding Ltd.
