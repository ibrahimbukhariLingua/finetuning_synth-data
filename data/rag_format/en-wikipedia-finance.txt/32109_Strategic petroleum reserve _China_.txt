# Strategic petroleum reserve (China)



The **Strategic Petroleum Reserve** (**SPR**; Chinese: 中华人民共和国战略石油储备) is an emergency fuel store of oil maintained by the People's Republic of China National Development and Reform Commission. China does not officially report its volume, but as of 2016ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the SPR was estimated to hold approximately 400 million barrels in total, out of a capacity of around 500 million barrels.


## Background

In 2007 China announced an expansion of their crude reserves into a two part system. Chinese reserves would consist of a government-controlled strategic reserve complemented by mandated commercial reserves. The government-controlled reserves was completed in three phases. Phase one consisted of a 101.9 million barrel reserve, mostly completed by the end of 2008. The second phase of the government-controlled reserves with an additional 170 million barrels for completion by 2011. Recently, Zhang Guobao the head of the National Energy Administration also stated that there will be a third phase that will expand reserves by 204 million barrels with the goal in 2009 of increasing China's SPR to 90 days of supply by 2020.
