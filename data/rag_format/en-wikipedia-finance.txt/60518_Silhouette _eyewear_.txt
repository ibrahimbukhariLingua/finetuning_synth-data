## History

The Silhouette Group was founded in 1964 by Anneliese and Arnold Schmied.

In 1991, Silhouette began producing sports eyewear under the licensed brand Adidas.

In the 1990s, importers in Italy, the USA, England, Denmark, Germany and Belgium were converted into subsidiaries of the company.

In 2000, the company expanded to France and Southeast Asia. In addition, founder Arnold Schmied became part of the board of directors, and his sons Klaus and Arnold Schmied and Tassilo Gruber succeeded him as company managers. During the same time, Silhouette International A. Schmied GmbH. & Co. KG and former holding company Schmied Beteiligungs AG merged to form Silhouette International Schmied AG.

In 2002, the company expanded to Hong Kong and in the Asian region.

As of 2007, the company's top management consisted only of brothers Klaus and Arnold Schmied.

In 2008, expansion into Eastern Europe and the Near and Middle East began.

In 2009, Silhouette's licensing agreement with Swarovski, which had existed since 1996, ended.

In 2013, Arnold and Klaus Schmied retired from the operational business to the management board, and their board mandates were taken over by Thomas Windischbauer and Daniel Rogger.

In 2014, a new subsidiary was founded in South America.

In 2016, Silhouette's brand neubau eyewear was founded. Since the beginning of 2021, NEUBAU EYEWEAR is an independent company.

Since 2017, the company has been a full-range supplier of both lenses and frames.

Since 1 November 2019, Reinhard Mahr and Arnold Schmied's son Michael Schmied have been managing the family business alongside Thomas Windischbauer. At the end of 2019, the Silhouette Group ended its 25-year licensing agreement with Adidas and launched its own sports eyewear brand, evil eye.
