Non-profit laws of India


# Non-profit laws of India



This article describes the various laws related to non profit organisations in India. A non profit organisation can be registered in India as a Society, under the Registrar of Societies or as a Trust, by making a Trust deed, or as a Section 8 Company, under the Companies Act, 2013.

Whether a trust, society or Section 8 company, the Income Tax Act, 1961 gives all categories equal treatment, in terms of exempting their income and granting 80G certificates, whereby donors to non-profit organisations may claim a rebate against donations made. Foreign contributions to non-profits are governed by FC(R)A regulations and the Home Ministry.

For an organisation to be termed as charity it requires Income tax clearances under 12A Section of Income Tax Act. Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act defines ‘charitable purpose’ to include ‘relief of the poor, education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility’. A purpose that relates exclusively to religious teaching or worship is not considered as charitable.


## Registration

A Non-Profit can be organized in India in the following ways:

* Trust under Public Trust Acts of various state governments
* A Society under Societies Registration Act, 1860
* Section-8 Company under Companies Act, 2013 (Formerly, Section-25 Under Companies Act, 1956)

## Trusts

A public charitable trust is usually floated when there is a property involved, especially in terms of land and building.


### Legislation

Different states in India have different Trusts Acts in force, which govern the trusts in the state. In the absence of a Trusts Act in any particular state or territory, the general principles of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 are applied.


### Main Instrument

The main instrument of any public charitable trust is the trust deed, wherein the aims and objects and mode of management (of the trust) should be enshrined. In every trust deed, the minimum and maximum number of trustees has to be specified. The trust deed should clearly spell out the aims and objects of the trust, how the trust should be managed, how other trustees may be appointed or removed, etc. The trust deed should be signed by both the settlor/s and trustee/s in the presence of two witnesses. The trust deed should be executed on non-judicial stamp paper, the value of which would depend on the valuation of the trust property.


### Application for Registration

* The application for registration should be made to the official having jurisdiction over the region in which the trust is sought to be registered.
* After providing details (in the form) regarding designation by which the public trust shall be known, names of trustees, mode of succession, etc., the applicant has to affix a court fee stamp of Rs.2/- to the form and pay a very nominal registration fee which may range from Rs.3/- to Rs.25/-, depending on the value of the trust property.
* The application form should be signed by the applicant before the regional officer or superintendent of the regional office of the charity commissioner or a notary. The application form should be submitted, together with a copy of the trust deed.
* Two other documents which should be submitted at the time of making an application for registration are affidavit and consent letter.

## Society

According to section 20 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860, the following societies can be registered under the Act: ‘charitable societies, military orphan funds or societies established at the several presidencies of India, societies established for the promotion of science, literature, or the fine arts, for instruction, the diffusion of useful knowledge, the diffusion of political education, the foundation or maintenance of libraries or reading rooms for general use among the members or open to the public, or public museums and galleries of paintings and other works of art, collection of natural history, mechanical and philosophical inventions, instruments or designs.’


### Legislation

### Main Instrument

The main instrument of a society is the memorandum of association and article of association. Memorandum of association is the charter of a society. It is a document describing the objects of its existence and its operations. The article of association includes the rules and regulations of the society.
