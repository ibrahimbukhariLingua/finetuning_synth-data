## Product overview


### For restaurants

Eat Appâ€™s reservation system allows for a digital record of all reservations, all guests that have previously visited the restaurant, as well as analytics on the performance of the restaurant. The table management feature simplifies traditional restaurant operations by providing a live snapshot of current status, seating optimization, and shift management.

The CRM and analytics suite gathers and monitors data to build a segmented guestbook for personalized marketing and provides dashboards for data-driven decision-making. Additionally, the review feature makes it easy for restaurants to automatically collect reviews from their guests.

Additionally, Eat App includes a chit printer function that seamlessly prints reservation details at host stands and a review management feature that allows restaurants to manage online reviews directly within the platform.
