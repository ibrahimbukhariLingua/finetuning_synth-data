## History

PriMedia (then named **Dial Media**) was founded in 1975 by Ed Valenti and Barry Becher. PriMedia became the first major infomercial company and launched several mainstream products including the Ginsu knives. The company also developed the “long-form” infomercial formats, which later developed into standard half-hour infomercial formats used in Home shopping channels including QVC and HSN. Primedia was one of the first to use toll-free telephone numbers in television ads to allow use of credit cards to order products in real-time.

James J. Cooney, who was a teenager when he first met the firm's co-founders, later joined the firm.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
