C. D. Howe Institute


# C. D. Howe Institute



The **C. D. Howe Institute** (French: *Institut C. D. Howe*) is a public policy think tank in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It aims to be distinguished by "research that is nonpartisan, evidence-based, and subject to definitive expert review." The institute's office is located in the Trader's Bank Building in downtown Toronto.

The C. D. Howe Institute publishes research that is national in scope and hosts events across Canada on a wide variety of issues in economic and social policy. Its stated mission is "to raise living standards by fostering economically sound public policies."


## Institute

The C. D. Howe Institute's origins go back to Montreal in 1958, when a group of prominent business and labour leaders organized the Private Planning Association of Canada (PPAC) to research and promote educational activities on issues related to public economic policy. In 1973, the PPAC's assets and activities became part of the C. D. Howe Memorial Foundation, created in 1961 to memorialize the late Right Honourable Clarence Decatur Howe. The new organization operated as the C. D. Howe Research Institute until 1982, when the Memorial Foundation chose to focus directly on memorializing C. D. Howe; the institute then adopted its current name: the C. D. Howe Institute.

The institute's research has been cited by Liberal, New Democrat and Conservative members of parliament. The media has described the institute as a centrist, right-wing, conservative, non-partisan, think tank. The institute "is happy to publish papers on either side of the ideological line, provided there is data to back it up." It has been described as having a "deep intellectual grounding to its public-policy approach".
