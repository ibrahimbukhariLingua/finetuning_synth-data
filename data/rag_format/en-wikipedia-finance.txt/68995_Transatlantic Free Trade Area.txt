A **Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement** (**TAFTA**) is a proposal to create a free-trade agreement covering Europe and North America, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Such proposals have been made since the 1990s. Between 2013 and about 2017 an agreement between the United States and the European Union (EU) was under negotiation - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - but it was abandoned. Canada and Mexico both have free trade agreements with both the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA).
