## Controversies and lawsuits

In 2019, Ashish Mishra left *The Ken* and started a rival online publication called The Morning Context. *The Ken* then filed a lawsuit against Mishra alleging unauthorised use of confidential information which it alleged was used to "set up and operate" The Morning Context . Following this The Morning Context filed a defamation suit against *The Ken* alleging “false, derogatory & slanderous public statements amounting to defamation”. *The Ken* responded to the notice by "categorically rejecting" the claims made in it. Later, *The Ken* withdrew its lawsuit against The Morning Context, Ashish Mishra and others on 24 May 2022.
