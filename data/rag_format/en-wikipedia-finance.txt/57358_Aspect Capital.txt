# Aspect Capital



**Aspect Capital** is a London-based investment manager that applies a systematic and quantitative approach to investment management. According to the Financial Times, Aspect uses "technology and complex mathematical models to power computers that trade the world's markets around the clock". Aspect manages USD6.6bn.

Aspect has approximately 128 employees.

The name and logo of the company derive from one of the founders’ passion for gliding and the aspect ratio of wing design: the wider the wing span, the more stable the plane.


## History

Aspect was established in 1997 by Anthony Todd, Martin Lueck, Michael Adam and Eugene Lambert. Two of Aspect's founders, Michael Adam and Martin Lueck, were co-founders of Adam, Harding & Lueck (AHL, now a part of the Man Group Plc), one of the earliest managed futures firms in Europe, with Anthony Todd and Eugene Lambert also working at AHL prior to founding Aspect. Aspect was set up with seed capital, the majority of which was provided by the fund of funds manager, RMF. Aspect started trading the Aspect Diversified Programme in 1998 with $22m of assets under management. Aspect opened sales offices in the US in 2004 and in Hong Kong in 2008


## Investment approach

Aspect offers a range of systematic investment strategies. The longest-running strategy is the Aspect Diversified Programme. The programme, which runs the majority of Aspect's assets under management, uses a medium-term trend following strategy which is designed to systematically and quantitatively identify and exploit trends in a broad range of highly liquid futures and foreign exchange markets to generate diversifying returns for investors. The Aspect Diversified Programme's investment philosophy is based on the premise that trends are a persistent feature of markets. Aspect's tagline: “The Science of Investment” emphasises the firm's philosophy of applying a scientific approach to investment management.
Aspect Diversified’s track record goes back to December 1998
