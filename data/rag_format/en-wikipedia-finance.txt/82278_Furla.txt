## History

Furla was founded in Bologna (Emilia-Romagna), Italy in 1927 by Aldo Furlanetto, selling ladies' accessories wholesale.

In 1955, the first Furla store was opened in Bologna. By the 1970s, Aldo Furlanetto children, Carlo, Paolo, and Giovanna Furlanetto assisted with the business.

During the same decade, Furla released the first collection of bags. In the early 1990s, Furla started to open stores and branches around the world.

In 2007, Furla celebrated its 80th anniversary with the introduction of "Furla Talent Hub Project".

In the same year, Furla's sales more than doubled to 513 million euros. The company then finalized the acquisition of the retail distribution network in China.

In 2019, the company declared that it would only use faux fur in its collections.
