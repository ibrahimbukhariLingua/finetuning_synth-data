# Bernd Baumann



**Bernd Baumann** (born 31 January 1958) is a German politician of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and chief whip of the AfD Group who has been serving as a member of the Bundestag from the state of Hamburg since 2017.


## Life and politics

Baumann was born 1958 in the West German city Herne and studied economics at the Ruhr University Bochum and achieved his PhD in 1991.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Baumann eventuated the newly founded populist AfD in 2013 and was presider (Landessprecher) of the party in the city state of Hamburg from 2015 to 2017.

In 2017 Baumann became the first chief whip (Erster Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer) of the AfD in the Bundestag.


## Positions

Bernd Baumann suspects an “infamous campaign” against his party by the largely tax-funded “Correctiv” organisation into a private meeting of right-wing politicians and business people in November 2023 in which AfD and CDU politicians as well as Martin Sellner (BI) took part. This is the responsibility of a “left-green class” of politicians and “large parts of the media,” he said in the ARD magazin Report from Berlin.
