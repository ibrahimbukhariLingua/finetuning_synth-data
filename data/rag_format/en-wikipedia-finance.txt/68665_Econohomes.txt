**Econohomes** is a privately held company based in Austin, Texas, specializing in foreclosures. It's known as real estate owned properties (REO), and specialty financing across the United States. The company buys distressed residential properties wholesale and resells them online at prices under $100,000. Buyers are mostly made up of investors who renovate and resell or rent the properties.


## History

Founded in 2006, Econohomes’ initial goal was to serve the deep sub-prime market by retailing affordable homes. But, after the subprime mortgage crisis, CEO Jeff Ball realigned the business model to sell to investors.

Jeff Ball is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the business, as well as spearheading capital raising efforts. Most recently, Jeff was the Global Head of Semiconductor Investment Banking at JPMorgan. Jeff received his JD and MBA from Santa Clara University. He received his BA in Economics and Theology from Georgetown University.

Econohomes offers full bilingual services and Spanish-language online information to help the Hispanic community buy more real estate as first time home owners and real estate investors.
