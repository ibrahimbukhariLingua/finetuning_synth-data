## History

The idea to start a Women's Bank in Tanzania began in 1999, when a number of female entrepreneurs approached the then President of Tanzania, Benjamin William Mkapa, with the idea. Eight years later, in 2007, the Tanzania Women's Bank Limited (TWBL) was created. The bank officially opened for business on 28 July 2009. TWB's aim is to empower women economically and socially. It serves all segments of society including *low income earners*, large corporations and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).


## Ownership

From the time of its creation, in 2007, as a private limited liability company, 97% of the shareholding in the stock of the bank was owned by the Government of Tanzania. The remaining 3% was owned by private institutions and individuals. In August 2012, the Tanzanian government began the process of listing the shares of the bank's stock on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), through the issuance of an initial public offering (IPO).
