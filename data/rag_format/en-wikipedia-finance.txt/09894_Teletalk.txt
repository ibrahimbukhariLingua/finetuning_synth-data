## Numbering scheme

Teletalk uses the following numbering scheme for its subscribers:

**+880 15 N₁N₂N₃N₄N₅N₆N₇N₈**

Where, **+880** is the ISD code for Bangladesh and is needed only in case of dialing from outside Bangladesh.

**15** is the access code for Teletalk as allocated by the Government of Bangladesh. Omitting +880 will require using 0 in place of it instead to represent local calls, hence 015 is the general access code.

**N₁N₂N₃N₄N₅N₆N₇N₈** is the subscriber number.

In 2018, when Mobile number portability was introduced users can port to any operator without changing its number.
