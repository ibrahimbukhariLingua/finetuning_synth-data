In recent years the company has begun to focus on the education aspects of M&A; a previously avoided subject in the industry. Due to the lack of information on the subject, the company felt that a shift in focus towards education could open up new horizons and as such, they have created a number of workshops, seminars, "webinars" and other training programs to help educate their employees, clients, other professionals and business intermediaries.

Robbinex is responsible for a fair deal of academic literature on the subject of business intermediation which have been published in several newspapers and magazines, including the *Hamilton Spectator*, *M&A Today* and the *Financial Post* (a division of the *National Post*) to name a few.


## Industry firsts

* Robbinex created the *Three Phase Process of Selling Businesses* Three Phase Process. Each of the three phases has a specific function. Phase 1 determines the companyâ€™s worth, Phase 2 prepares the documentation to represent the business, and Phase 3 negotiates to achieve the best possible value for the business owner. The *Three Phase Process* is recognized by business brokers as one of the most important works of recent times on the subject and is the only business mediation process that is ISO9001 registered.
