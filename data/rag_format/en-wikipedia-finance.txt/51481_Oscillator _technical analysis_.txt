# Oscillator (technical analysis)



An **oscillator** in technical analysis of financial markets is an indicator **that informs if the price of a financial instrument is very high or very low**, indicating whether it is overbought or oversold. This helps traders make decisions about when to trade (buy or sell) that instrument.

Oscillators vary over time within a band, moving above and below a center line or between set levels. They are used to identify short-term overbought or oversold conditions.


## Examples

Common oscillators include MACD, momentum, RSI, and CCI.
