**Delaware County National Bank** is a historic bank building in Chester, Pennsylvania, located at the southwest corner of 3rd Street and Avenue of the States (formerly Market Square) adjacent to the Old St. Paul's Church burial ground. It was built between 1882 and 1884, and is a 2+1‚ÅÑ2-story masonry building in the Renaissance Revival style. It is built of brick and brownstone and has a low hipped slate-covered roof. The roof features metal cresting, five projecting decorated chimneys, and four Corinthian order pilasters supporting the front pediment dormer. It was headquarters for the Delaware County National Bank from 1884 to 1930.


## History

During the construction of the current building in 1882, the Bank transacted business in the old kitchen annex of the cashier's home.

Delaware County National Bank was chartered by the Pennsylvania state government in 1814 and was Delaware County's first bank. In 1864, the bank was incorporated as a national bank. In 1882, the Board of Directors determined that the bank had outgrown the original 1814 building and hired Patrick A. Welsh to design a new building. The building was razed and the current Delaware County National Bank was built on the same site.

In 1930, the building stopped serving as the offices of the Delaware County National Bank. Since then it has served as offices for the Crozer-Chester Medical Center, the United Way and the RDC Institute.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
