## History

The Richardson family has been synonymous with the grain industry in western Canada from the early days of European settlement to the present. James Richardson came to Canada from Ireland in 1822 or 1823. He started in Kingston, Ontario, with a tailor shop, and when he took payment in grain, he was forced into the grain business. Giving up his tailor shop, he and his two sons — George Armstrong and Henry Westman — formed James Richardson and Sons in 1857, ten years prior to the Confederation of Canada.

In 1867, the company purchased its first schooner ship to transport grain from Canadian farmers to American buyers. By 1868, James Richardson and Sons acquired enough capital to purchase a wharf and warehouse on the Kingston waterfront. Richardson began building their first grain elevator in 1882 in Kingston, which was finished in 1883 whereupon the company began shipping across the prairies on the newly-completed Canadian railway. Also in 1883, James Richardson became the first to arrange the initial shipment of wheat from western Canada through the lake system to Liverpool, England. Another elevator was built at Neepawa, Manitoba, in 1890. By this time, JRSL had hired its first female employee.

In the 1890s, the company relocated to Winnipeg Grain Exchange. In 1897, George opened a branch office in Toronto. Soon after, in 1910, James Richardson and Sons opened a location in Vancouver, followed shortly by Calgary, Saskatoon, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge. In 1912, George's son, James Armstrong Richardson (I), was made Vice-President of the company. The following year, JRSL established the Pioneer Grain Company Ltd. to operate the company's expanding collection of western country grain elevators.

In 1917, JRSL constructed **Richardson Terminal** in Port Arthur. The Terminal would unload its first railcar of grain from the Prairies on 3 January 1919. Also that year, James Armstrong Richardson Sr. became President of the company.

In 1925, James Richardson & Sons established a radio station in Moose Jaw with the call sign **CJRM-AM**. The radio business was exited in the 1940s, and is now 620 CKRM in Regina. In 1926, JRSL joined the Montreal Stock Exchange and a year later, acquired the Wall Street brokerage of E. A. Pierce & Co.

In 1930, James Armstrong founded Western Canada Airways (later Canadian Airways), Canada's first commercial carrier. (It was founded in 1926, but was fully established in 1930.) The two were later absorbed by Canadian Pacific Air Lines in 1942.

Following James Armstrong's unexpected death in 1939, his wife Muriel Sprague Richardson became JRSL's fifth President in 1940. As the first woman to run a major Canadian corporation, she oversaw JRSL's operations for the next 27 years. In 1954, JRSL established **Marine Pipeline Construction of Canada** in Calgary, which would later go on to build the first 42-inch pipeline and the first commercial natural gas pipeline north of the 60th parallel. At the height of the Cold War, JRSL was able to land a $20-million grain sale to China, ending a long-standing ban by the Communist government on Western imports.

James and Muriel's son, George Taylor Richardson (GTR; named after his uncle), was appointed president in 1966, while his elder brother, James Armstrong Richardson Jr., was named chairman (later becoming a minister in the Pierre Trudeau government). Soon after, the company began putting its efforts towards repatriating the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), which was still chartered as a British corporation, with its board based in London. Upon the consummation of the deal, on HBC's 300th anniversary, GTR became its first Canadian governor. (In 1979, however, the Richardson family ultimately sold their holdings for $38.50 per share.)

In 1979, the 112,000-tonne **Pioneer Grain** port terminal was officially opened in Vancouver's north shore. In 1986, JRSL purchased 50% of Tundra Oil & Gas, which would later become a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2000.

With GTR's retirement as CEO in 1993, his son Hartley Richardson took the lead, with his cousin James Armstrong Richardson Jr. as vice-president. In 1999, James Richardson International acquired Canbra Foods Ltd., a fully-integrated canola processing and packaging facility in Lethbridge, Alberta.

The Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport was opened in 2011, named in honour of James Richardson the first. In 2021, JRSL announced its acquisition of Bison Transport, a Canadian transport company that operates throughout North America.
