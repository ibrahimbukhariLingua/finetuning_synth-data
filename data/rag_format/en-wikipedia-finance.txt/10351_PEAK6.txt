## Background

In 1997, Peak6 was founded in Chicago by Matt Hulsizer and Jenny Just who were previously options traders O'Connor & Associates. They left after O'Connor was acquired by UBS and the new venture was funded by $1.5 million in seed capital from partners at O'Connor, friends and family.

Peak6 achieved early success by options proprietary trading and used the profits to profits to expand its business. In 2006, Peak6 launched OptionsHouse, an online options and equities brokerage platform. Peak6 also launched a hedge fund.

In May 2012, Penson Worldwide which owned the clearing and custody firm used to settle trades and hold assets for OptionsHouse asked to borrow money from Peak6 as it was close to bankruptcy. Peak6 then paid $60 million to acquire Penson's clearing business which was formed as an new entity, Apex Clearing (now known as Apex Fintech Solutions).

In 2014, Peak6 sold OptionsHouse to General Atlantic for $200 million. In September that year, Peak6 spun out its $2.3 billion hedge fund as Achievement Asset Management.

By 2015, various fintech firms such as Robinhood Markets, Wealthfront, Betterment and Stash had started using Apex. Apex also expanded into powering digital wealth management and in 2018, started offering cryptocurrency services.

Peak6 has attempted to lessen the gender imbalance at the company. In 2016, it launched an intern program called "Trading Experience for Women". Initially it began with 7 women in the program and by 2021 it had trained 40 women since inception leading to 35% of Peak6's traders being female.

II which would value Apex at $4.7 billion. However, by December 2021, the plan was withdrawn mainly due to scrutiny by the regulators which led to a $1.5 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
