## History

On February 1, 1948, the bank was established by Marius Saradar, and was entirely owned by the family, most likely for the purpose of managing the family's money.

On March 29, 2004, Bank Audi and Bank Saradar signed an agreement to merge the two banks in a deal valued at that time $159 million, thus the new group became known as Bank Audi Saradar.

In May 2016, Saradar Bank was reborn, after Mario Saradar's exit from *Bank Audi*. The shareholder base of Saradar Bank expanded to include: Carlos Ghosn, Maktat Group, Mikati Group, Saradar Group, Shammas Group, Al Bustani Family, Al Khazen Family and the Swiss Wiederkehr Group.
