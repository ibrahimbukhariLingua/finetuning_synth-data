# NTUC FairPrice



**NTUC FairPrice** is the largest supermarket chain in Singapore. The company is a co-operative of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). The group has more than 100 supermarkets across the island, with over 160 outlets of Cheers convenience stores island-wide.

NTUC FairPrice has partnered with ExxonMobil to run several stations with a FairPrice branding at the minimarts at their stations. The supermarket has the slogan "Singapore's very own".


## History

In November 1972, NTUC announced its new consumer co-operative named Welcome, which opened in February 1973. On 22 July 1973, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew opened the first supermarket at Block 192, Toa Payoh Lorong 4, and it was the first of its kind.

In August 2007, FairPrice opened its upmarket outlet at Bukit Timah Plaza named FairPrice Finest, after five months of refurbishment.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The move was to cater to the changing tastes of Singaporeans who are increasingly well-travelled. The 4,000 square metres (43,000 sq ft), two-storey outlet has an offering of products different from other FairPrice stores, and also features a Swiss-style delicatessen, a wine cellar and a European bakery.


### International operations

FairPrice has attempted to expand into other countries. Its first attempt was Malaysia in 1994, operating as a 60:40 joint venture with Hong Leong Industries Berhad under Quayline FairPrice. Its competitors were Parkson and Jaya Jusco. The first outlet was at Ampang Point, which opened on 3 January 1994. Despite no longer operating in Malaysia, FairPrice had no plans to restart its operations in the country.

In 2003, it entered a joint venture with DBS Private Equity, New Hope Group, Silver Tie and Taiwan's Apex Group, known as Nextmall.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The venture provided merchandising, management and logistics for a fee to Nextmart which is a China incorporated hypermarket. Seven hypermarkets were opened in China, with its first in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Nextmall closed in 2005 after incurring a total of $80 million in debts and over $40 million in losses.

A supermarket in Vietnam was opened in 2013 under a joint venture with Saigon Union of Trading Co-operatives, known as Co.opXtra Plus. FairPrice also operated Cheers convenience stores in Vietnam as of 2018.
