Indonesian Young Entrepreneur Association


# Indonesian Young Entrepreneur Association



**The Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association** (Indonesian: Himpunan Pengusaha Muda Indonesia) abbreviated as **HIPMI**, is an independent, non-partisan organization of young Indonesian entrepreneurs engaged in the economic sector. The organization was founded on June 10, 1972, by several national entrepreneurs including Drs. Abdul Latief, Ir. Siswono Yudo Husodo, Teuku Sjahrul, Datuk Hakim Thantawi, Badar Tando, Drs. Rudy Kairupan, Irawan Djajaatmadja, SH, Hari Sjamsudin Mangaan, Pontjo Sutowo, and Ir. Mahdi Diah.

The establishment of this organization was driven by the spirit of fostering entrepreneurship among the youth. On November 23, 2022, Akbar Buchari was elected as the Chairman of the Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association (term 2022–2025), succeeding the previous chairman, Mardani H. Maming.


## Organizational Structure

The organizational structure of HIPMI exists at both the central and regional levels. HIPMI has established a Central Executive Board (BPP) headquartered in the capital city, Regional Executive Boards based in the provincial capitals, and Branch Executive Boards based in the regency/city capitals. To date, HIPMI has a presence in 37 provinces in Indonesia and comprises 354 Branch Executive Boards. In line with regional autonomy and expansion, HIPMI continues to grow to ensure representation throughout Indonesia.


## Membership

The organization's regulations establish two types of membership. Regular Members are those aged 17 – 40 years. Those who have surpassed the age of 41 are granted the status of Extraordinary Members, commonly referred to as Seniors. Membership is open to anyone who owns a business.


## HIPMI University (HIPMI PT)

HIPMI University, established on August 21, 2006, is an autonomous organization initiated by Erwin Aksa, Raja Sapta Oktohari, and Bahlil Lahadalia. The organization was first inaugurated by Jusuf Kalla, the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, and Erwin Aksa, Chairman of HIPMI for the 2008–2011 period. As its name suggests, HIPMI PT accepts members who are still undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students. With the presence of HIPMI PT, it is hoped that students can create job opportunities rather than just seeking employment.

HIPMI initiated this organization due to the high unemployment rate in Indonesia. The organization observed that a significant portion of the unemployed were educated individuals. Therefore, university students are trained to become Economic Heroes who can improve the quality of human resources mentally, create jobs, and develop businesses effectively. The types of businesses run by HIPMI PT members are typically medium-sized enterprises, such as restaurants, cafes, freelance design services, and so on.
