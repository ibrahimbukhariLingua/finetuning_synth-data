Personal Assets Trust


# Personal Assets Trust



**Personal Assets Trust** is a large British investment trust. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The chairman is Hamish Buchan.


## History

The company was established through a rights issue by a much larger fund, Atlantic Assets, managed by Ivory and Sime, in 1983. In 1990, an asset manager with Ivory and Sime, Ian Rushbrook, took over the management of the company and decided that it should be "run expressly for private investors". Over the next 25 years, he grew the business significantly and also used it as a vehicle to protect his own family's financial interests.
