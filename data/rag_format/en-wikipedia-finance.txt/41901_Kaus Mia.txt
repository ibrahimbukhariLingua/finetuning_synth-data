# Kaus Mia



**Md Kaus Mia** (Bengali: কাউছ মিয়া; 26 August 1931 – 25 June 2024) was a Bangladeshi tycoon known for his long-term tax payment record and his work popularizing processed chewing tobacco. He founded Kaus Tobacco Industries and launched the Hakim Pury Zarda chewing tobacco brand.

Mia started as a small shopkeeper in Chandpur at the age of 19 after borrowing money from his mother. Over the decades, he ventured into trading and manufacturing businesses including real estate, shipping, chemicals and tobacco. In 1967, while Bangladesh was part of Pakistan, Mia was recognized by authorities as the top taxpayer in the region—a notable achievement for a self-made businessman.

In independent Bangladesh, Mia consistently received National Tax Card awards from the National Board of Revenue (NBR) for over a decade, being named the best taxpayer in the business category for 15 consecutive years. As per news reports, he credited his tax compliance to a sense of national duty.

As of 2021, he reportedly had a net worth of around Tk10,000 crore (৳100 billion, ~$1 billion). Mia died on 25 June 2024, at the age of 92.
