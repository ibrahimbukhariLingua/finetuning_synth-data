Centaur Media


# Centaur Media



**Centaur Media** (LSE: CAU) is a London-based business information, events and marketing provider to professional and commercial markets. It currently operates through two segments: Xeim (marketing and communications), and The Lawyer. It was formed in 1981 by Graham Sherren, and is incorporated as a public limited company.


## Recent history

Centaur Media was traditionally associated with B2B print magazines such as Marketing Week, The Engineer and The Lawyer on a controlled circulation model. In the words of previous CEO Geoff Wilmot: "We're publishing the titles on behalf of the advertisers but maintaining editorial integrity. Our revenues came from display advertising, classified adverts and recruitment."

In 2011, Wilmot, who became CEO from 2006, described Centaur Media as a company in a process of change, both structurally and in relation to the emergence of digital media. “We used to describe ourselves as a federation of small businesses. Somebody once said: 'It's more like an archipelago of businesses with a lot of water in between.'" In this period, Centaur Media embarked on a restructuring programme after the recession, with investment in its exhibition and information arms.

Wilmot left Centaur in June 2013 along with the managing director of the business publishing division, Tim Potter, with Wilmot shelving a bid to take over the business in October 2013.


## Andria Vidler becomes CEO

This transition in Centaur Media continued after the appointment of Andria Vidler as CEO in November 2013. According to an article in *The Guardian* from August 2014, Vidler inherited a pre-tax loss of £37.4 million in the year to the end of June 2013 and, by year end, debt had grown to £27 million.

Under her leadership, Centaur embarked on a strategy of becoming what Vidler termed a "B2B business information" group, moving away from “a reliance on tactical trade advertising”. This has meant a greater emphasis on information-led digital subscription products.

By 2017, Centaur Media's revenue mix was: marketing services 8%; events 42%; digital premium content 24%; digital advertising 14%; and print 10%. In 2014, digital advertising and print had accounted for 15% and 24%, respectively.

Vidler oversaw a disposal process in 2018-19 that saw Centaur Media divest its financial services division, Centaur Human Resources and engineering portfolio, raising more than £20 million.

In September 2019, Centaur Media announced that Vidler was stepping down as CEO, with former CFO Swag Mukerji succeeding her.

The company's senior executive management comprises: Swag Mukerji (CEO); Linda Smith (Chief Operating Officer); Howard Chapman (interim CFO); Steve Newbold (Divisional Managing Director, Marcomms Division); Suki Thompson (CEO and Founding Partner of Oystercatchers); and Andy Baker (Divisional Managing Director, Legal Division).

Centaur Media shifted its location from Fitzrovia to London's South Bank in December 2019.
