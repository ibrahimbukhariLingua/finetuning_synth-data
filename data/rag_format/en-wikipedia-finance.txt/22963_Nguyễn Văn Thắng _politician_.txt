## Controversies

On May 18, 2020, the Quảng Ninh People's Committee issued a decision recognizing the Principal of Hạ Long University. Accordingly, Nguyễn Văn Thắng, Chairman of the Quảng Ninh People's Committee, concurrently held the position of Principal of Hạ Long University for the 2020–2025 term. This decision sparked diverse opinions in the press and public regarding its feasibility and legality.

In an interview with Tiền phong, then Minister of Home Affairs, Lê Vĩnh Tân, stated, "The law does not specify that the Chairman of a Provincial People's Committee can concurrently hold any position in a public service unit," adding that he personally "heard of it for the first time" and that it was unprecedented.
