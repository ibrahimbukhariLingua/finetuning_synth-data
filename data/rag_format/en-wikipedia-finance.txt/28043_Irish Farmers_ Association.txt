## History

It was founded in January 1955 as the **National Farmers Association** (NFA), aiming to lead Irish farmers out of the depression and deprivation which had dominated rural Ireland for decades.

The NFA merged in the 1960s with four smaller organisations representing specific sectors (including Leinster Milk Producers (now Fresh Milk Producers), beet growers and horticulture) to form the Irish Farmers Association – the IFA.

In the 1972 referendum on Irish membership of the European Economic Community, the IFA campaigned for a "yes" vote, seeking access to European markets and higher prices for agricultural produce.

The IFA denounced the European Union–Mercosur Free Trade Agreement as a "disgraceful and feeble sell-out".


## Salary controversy

In November 2015, Eddie Downey (President) and Pat Smith (General Secretary) resigned due to a salary controversy. Smith's salary in 2013 had been €535,000. He resigned on 18 November. A week later, members of the organisation's national executive council were informed that Smith had been given €2m in severance and €2.7m in pension. Eddie Downey admitted he had signed off on this agreement and resigned. Downey was earning €147,000 a year plus €50,000 in add-ons when he resigned.

The IFA confirmed that former chief economist Con Lucey—who had attempted to raise concerns over financial issues and transparency before quitting under duress in 2014—would oversee a review of salaries and expenses.
