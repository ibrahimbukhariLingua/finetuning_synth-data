## History


### First years

After nine years in exile due to the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, Aurelio de Arteche y Arana (1908–1983) returned to Bilbao, his hometown, in 1946 to accomplish his main life objective: creating a company like Usines Balteau, S.A., a company he knew during his exile in Belgium.

Thanks to help from friends, family and Marcel Balteau, Aurelio founded EAHSA, Electrotecnica Arteche Hermanos, S.A., in December 1946.

EAHSA manufactured Balteau's Instrument Transformers for the Spanish and Portuguese markets.


### 1954 to 1974

1954-74 was a period of stronger growth for Arteche. Manufacturing Balteau's Instrument Transformers and ICE-Paris's Auxiliary Relays. The company grew over 22,8% per year.

During these years, Arteche expanded in the national market, becoming a benchmark for the Spanish power industry.

Aurelio decided that producing under license presented major disadvantages, primarily inability to develop its own technology, and inability to export to other markets.


### 1974 to 1995

In 1973, Arteche ended its relationship with Usines Balteau, S.A. and with ICE-Paris.

The company sought the ability to export beyond the Iberian Peninsula, objected the grant of a license to a rival Portuguese company, and Usines Balteau's refusal to create a common technology center. The separation from ICE-Paris was triggered by frequent supply problems.

However, the main reason was Arteche's desire to internationalize and develop its own products.

During this period growth shrank to 1,5% per year. A substantial portion of the company resources were devoted to the development of new products and to open new markets.

Arteche completed several milestones during this period, such as the production of its own Auxiliary Relays (1976), Instrument Transformers up to 765 kV (1981) and Electronic Instrument Transformers (1990). During these years, Arteche had its first sales in South America (1976) and North America (1993).


### 1995-

Arteche entered Asia (2004) and Oceania (2010), while adding products include Voltage Transformers for GIS substations and Optical Current Transformers (2010).

In 2012 Arteche changes its visual identity, adapting its logotype. The new logo is based upon a fractal, a succession of almost parallel lines, a structure that repeats itself at different levels, with Arteche's colours in gradients.
