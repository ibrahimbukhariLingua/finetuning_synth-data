Treasury Select Committee


# Treasury Select Committee



The **House of Commons Treasury Committee** (often referred to as the **Treasury Select Committee**) is a select committee of the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The committee is responsible for examining and scrutinizing the expenditure, administration and policy of HM Treasury. This includes its agencies and associated bodies, including HM Revenue and Customs, the Bank of England, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Royal Mint.

The current chair of the Treasury Select Committee is Dame Meg Hillier MP, from the Labour Party. The position of chair is considered influential, as the holder of the office can scrutinize figures including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of England, as well as bank executives.


## History

The select committee was established in 1979 as the **Treasury and Civil Service Committee**. Since 2010, the Treasury Committee has taken on new powers, including the right to veto appointments to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, and has forced the Financial Services Authority to publish a detailed report into its handling of the collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland.

The select committee has been described as an influential one within British politics. In 2016, the committee was described as among the three most powerful select committees in the House of Commons, along with the Public Accounts Committee and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee.


### Activities


#### Valuation Office Agency (VOA) Inquiry

On 1 February 2019, the Treasury Committee launched an inquiry looking into the impact of business rates and any unfairness in the system of rateable valuation operated by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA). The inquiry heard evidence from many businesses and trade organisations. The findings of this inquiry outlined that the service was broken and public confidence had been eroded. In its reply to the inquiry, February 2020, the Government promised to make changes to business rates as part of a fundamental review of the VOA.
