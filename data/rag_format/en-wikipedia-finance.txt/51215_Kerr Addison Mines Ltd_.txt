Kerr Addison Mines Ltd.


# Kerr Addison Mines Ltd.



**Kerr Addison Mines Ltd** was a Toronto-based mining and gas company that owned various mines throughout Canada, including the Agnew Lake Mine, the Kerr-Addison Mine and Chesterville gold mine.

In the 1960s, Kerr Addison was Canada's largest gold producer.

The injury of a snowmobiler on company property in 1975 led to a Supreme Court of Canada judgement setting precedent for future Occupier's Liability cases in Canada.


## History

In 1904, H. L. Kerr was prospecting for uranium around Larder Lake and identified an area that he wanted to return to. Kerr spoke to Bill Addison, who visited the area in 1906. Shortly afterwards they formally registered their claim, formed Kerr Addison Gold Mines, and started the Kerr-Addison Mine. Production was slow in initial years, and ownership of the mine officially changed hands three times, with the third owner being Associated Goldfields Limited, buying the mine in 1917. Associated Goldfields Limited became Canadian Associated Goldfields in 1921 and went bankrupt in 1928. Proprietary Mines Limited was then formed, and took over the mines, while also buying up additional sixteen claims. Kerr-Addison Mines Limited was incorporated in 1963, out of a merger of Kerr-Addison Gold Mines, Anglo-Huronian, Bouzan Mines and Prospector Airways and bought the Kerr-Addison mine from Canadian Associated Goldfields Limited in 1937. In 1957, the company bought the neighbouring Chesterville gold mine.

In 1978, the executive vice president was P. S. Cross, WIliam James was the CEO, and W. S. Row was the chairman of the board.

As of 1982, Ian D. Bayer was the president and CEO and major shareholder.
