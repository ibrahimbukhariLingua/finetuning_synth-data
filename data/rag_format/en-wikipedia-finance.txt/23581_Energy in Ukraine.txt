Energy in Ukraine


# Energy in Ukraine

 

Energy in Ukraine is mainly from gas and nuclear, followed by oil and coal. Ukraine has a diversified energy mix, and no fuel takes up more than a third of the country‚Äôs energy sources. Most gas and oil is imported, but since 2015 energy policy has prioritised diversifying energy supply.

The coal industry has been disrupted by war, and as of 2024 over 70% of electricity generation is nuclear. The largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, is located in Ukraine. Fossil fuel subsidies were USD 1.6 billion in 2021. Until the 2010s all of Ukraine's nuclear fuel came from Russia, but now most does not.

Ukraine‚Äôs gas network has much storage, which can be useful for storing Europe's gas to even out supply and demand, and it formerly transited much Russian natural gas to Europe but that agreement ends at the end of 2024. Some energy infrastructure was destroyed in the Russo-Ukrainian War, but wind farms and solar power are thought to be resilient because they are distributed. An energy strategy to 2050 was adopted in 2023 but has not yet been published. There is a draft energy and climate plan to 2030.


## History

In 2011, Ukraine joined the European Energy Community, however there has been slow progress on implementing European energy regulations.

## Heating

District heating has been attacked and significantly damaged. In 2024 the International Energy Agency (IEA) wrote about heat supply to Ukraine‚Äôs major cities. ‚ÄúMost attacks on heating infrastructure have occurred in regions close to the front lines. The Kharkiv region is now without large-scale heat generating capacity and other frontline regions ‚Äì particularly Chernihiv, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy and Mykolaiv ‚Äì have suffered severe damage to their heat generation capacities. Heat supply is also at risk in Ukraine‚Äôs capital, Kyiv.‚Äù


## Efficiency and demand response

In 2024 the IEA recommended engaging consumers in energy saving and demand response, while continuing investments in energy efficiency. They said that ‚Äúa social tariff that safeguards a certain volume of consumption at subsidised rates, after which consumers pay a higher price, would help to incentivise efficient practices and investments, supported by public information campaigns that advise on energy efficiency measures for immediate impact as well as longer-term gains. Lowering the default temperature for district heating can also provide quick savings.‚Äù


## Personnel and finance

Ukraine signed a loan agreement in-principle for $3.65 billion with the China Development Bank in 2012, during President Viktor Yanukovich's term of office, contingent on the development of agreed projects in the coal and gas sectors. However, by 2017 Ukraine had not agreed any suitable projects due to a "lack of convergence in the positions of [Uglesintezgaz] and the energy ministry". Elementum Energy Ltd owns the most power plants.‚Åø·µâ·µâ·µà êû•·µò·µí·µó·µÉ·µó‚Å±·µí‚Åø ·µó·µí ·µõ·µâ ≥‚Å±·∂† ∏

The European Investment Bank is financing municipal district heating and energy efficiency projects. Although by 2024 more women were working in the energy sector than before they were still underrepresented in leadership positions.


## During war

In the winter of 2022‚Äì23 Russia targeted switchyards and transformers, but the following year they concentrated on power plants perhaps because they are harder to protect and take longer to repair.
