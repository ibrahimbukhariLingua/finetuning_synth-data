## Career

While working in the Finance Department of W.R. Grace & Co. first in New York City and then in Lausanne, he was invited to join the Graduate School of Business at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg as Senior Lecturer in Finance and subsequently Director of the MBA Program.

When the Soweto riots and subsequent police crackdown occurred in South Africa, he moved to the State University of New York in Binghamton where he became Associate Professor with tenure in 1983 and Chair of the Finance and Economics Group.

After joining IMEDE in Lausanne, one of the two management development institutes that later merged to form IMD, he became the first Director of Research and held the Sandoz Family Foundation Chair in Strategic Change Management.

## Research work

Strebel is the originator of several managerial frameworks, including:

**Outpacing Strategy**

Outpacing Strategy (developed together with Xavier Gilbert) provides a dynamic perspective on business strategy, as opposed to the more unidimensional perspective of generic strategies. Instead of competing solely on value, or cost, firms can outpace the competition by shifting strategic innovation between the value proposition and the value delivery system in a timely way that reenergizes the organization and develops complementary capabilities that provide a competitive advantage.

**Industry Breakpoints**

Industry Breakpoints involve a new offering to the market that changes the rules of the competitive game, shifts the industry growth rate and realigns market shares. Breakpoints are triggered not only by disruptive technology innovations, but also by divergent competitive shifts in the variety and customization of the value proposition, or convergent shifts in the scope and organizational efficiency of the value delivery system.
