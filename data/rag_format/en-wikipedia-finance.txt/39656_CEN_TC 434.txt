CEN/TC 434


# CEN/TC 434



**CEN/TC 434** (CEN Technical Committee 434) is a technical body within the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) developing standards in the field of Electronic Invoicing.


## Overview

CEN/TC 434 has developed the European Standard on Electronic Invoicing (EN 16931–1) and other ancillary standardization deliverables required by the European Directive 2014/55/EU.

Directive 2014/55/EU also required:

> * the test of the standard as to its practical application for an end user,
> * a report on the outcome of the test to the European Parliament and the Council by the European Commission and, after the publication and the test of the standard,
> * the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of a reference to the European Standard together with the list of a limited number of syntaxes (that CEN published as TS 16931-2).


## Workgroups

CEN/TC 434 has the following working groups (WGs):

* CEN/TC 434/WG 1 Core semantic data model
* CEN/TC 434/WG 3 Syntax bindings
* CEN/TC 434/WG 4 Guidelines at transmission level
* CEN/TC 434/WG 5 Extension methodology
* CEN/TC 434/WG 6 Test methodology and test results
* CEN/TC 434/WG 7 Registry Services

CEN/TC 434/WG 2 (List of syntaxes) was disbanded.
