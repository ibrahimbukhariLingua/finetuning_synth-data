## History

Cleveland Electric was founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1925 by Ras Cleveland and specialized in electric motor repair. Over time, the company expanded into electric apparatus repair, sales and service. Its motor business grew and eventually produced about $30 million in revenue. The original location of the business resided in downtown Atlanta near the Georgia Tech Campus. The location was later sold to the Coca Cola Company and the site now houses their World Headquarters Campus.

After World War II, Cleveland Electric began electrical construction work. In 1959 Ras Cleveland's two sons, Louie Cleveland, Sr. and James Cleveland, Sr. took over the business. Louie managed repairs and James managed construction.

In 1962 Cleveland Electric started a mechanical construction department and purchased an instrumentation company. The motor repair portion of the business was sold in 1998. Growing construction in the South allowed the company to expand and grow into its current target areas.
