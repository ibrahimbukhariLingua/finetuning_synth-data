## Initiatives

The China Consumers Association requested on 1 March that movie theatres should avoid holiday price rising and level film-ticket pricing, following consumer complaints during the Lunar New Year holiday. The group received almost 100,000 unfavourable remarks about movie ticket prices during the seven-day holiday beginning on 11 February. According to the group, complaints about excessive ticket prices peaked the fifth day of the holiday on 15 February. The association stated in a response that we advise responsible parties for film tickets to stabilize prices and adhere to market regulations while caring more about User experiences.

China Consumers Association developed a complaint-handling mechanism in collaboration with 17 of the leading e-commerce platforms like Taobao.com, JD.com, and Vip.com. The mechanism was initiated for the internet shoppers who find it easier to resolve their complaints which are directly handled by the platform's after-sales system connected to the e-commerce platforms and gets prioritized for the resolution, thus avoiding any conflicts for online buyers in the future.
