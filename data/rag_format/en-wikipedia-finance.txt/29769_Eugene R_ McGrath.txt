## Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc.

In 1963, McGrath graduated from Manhattan College with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. He accepted a position with Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. directly upon graduation. He started his career as an engineer and management trainee in the operating and customer-service divisions.

McGrath excelled in his employment with Con Edison, moving into management, and becoming responsible for running fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants. He continued to move progressively into more responsible positions, eventually being elected to vice president of the company in 1978.

Continuing his education, McGrath received his Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Iona College in New York in 1980. The following year, he was promoted to senior vice president, and in 1982, executive vice president. In 1987, McGrath became one of the trustees of the company.

In 1989, he attended the six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard University and was subsequently named the president and chief operating officer of the company. In September 1990, he accepted the position of chairman of the board and chief executive officer.

In April 2001, Consolidated Edison filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that they had tripled the compensation of McGrath, to $9 million. Much of the increase was made up of restricted stock, valued at $6.2 million. This was a benefit that he had never received before. In addition to the stock, his salary was increased 9.1 percent to $1.03 million, with 67 percent bonus of $981,000. A statement included in the filing credited McGrath with several achievements, including "good financial and operating results, motivating the company's work force, and continued progress in achieving the goal of environmental excellence."

In September 2005, Kevin Burke assumed the roles of president and chief executive officer, while McGrath remained as chairman of the board.
