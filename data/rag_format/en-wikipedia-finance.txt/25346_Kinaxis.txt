## History

Kinaxis was founded in 1984 as Cadence Computer Corporation, to do supply-chain analysis of using custom mainframe computers, by three former Mitel engineers. The name was later changed to Carp Systems International (after the nearby Carp River), then Enterprise Planning Systems. In the mid 1990s, it changed its name to Webplan, and shifted from making hardware to providing software.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Recent history

In 2000, it led a venture round that raised $33 million. In 2005, it renamed itself Kinaxis, and started focusing on selling software by subscription, as opposed to collecting a one-time fee. In June 2014, it held an IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising a total of $100 million. Since then, its market capitalization has increased to $1.7 billion, as of August 2017. In 2022 they acquired MPO, a multi party orchestration platform connecting Supply Chain actors.

In December 2024, Kinaxis Inc. has rejected calls from activist investors to pursue a sale, emphasizing its commitment to creating long-term shareholder value. Daventry Group LP, holding a 1.3% stake in the company, issued a letter urging the board to explore a sale, while Irenic Capital Management LP echoed this sentiment in a separate statement. In response, Kinaxis hired Goldman Sachs for strategic advice and reaffirmed its focus on its current business plan.
