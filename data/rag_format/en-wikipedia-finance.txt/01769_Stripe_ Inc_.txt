## History

Irish entrepreneur brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in Palo Alto, California, in 2010, and serve as the company's president and CEO, respectively. In 2011 the company received a $2 million investment, including contributions from Elon Musk, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Irish entrepreneur Liam Casey, and venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and SV Angel.

In March 2013, Stripe made its first acquisition, Kickoff, a chat and task-management application. In 2012 the company moved from Palo Alto to San Francisco. In October 2019, the company announced that it would be moving from the South of Market area to Oyster Point in the neighbouring city of South San Francisco in 2021. In February 2021, Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of Canada and of the Bank of England, was appointed to the company's board.

Stripe acquired accountancy platform Recko in October 2021 whose solution was to be added to Stripe's existing suite of financial tools.

In January 2022, Stripe entered a five-year partnership with Ford Motor Company; through this deal, Stripe will handle transactions for consumer vehicle orders and reservations. That same month, Stripe partnered with Spotify to help creators monetize subscriptions, accept payments and launch recurring revenue streams. In April 2022, Twitter announced that it will partner with Stripe Inc (digital payments processor) for piloting cryptocurrency payouts for limited users in the platform. "The crypto payments will be routed through Stripe Connect, which will also handle KYC requirements", Stripe said. The company announced it was also planning to add options for payment in other cryptocurrencies in the future.

In April 2022, Stripe announced its strategic partnership with UK-based fintech company ION. The *Wall Street Journal* reported in July 2022 that the company's internal share price had fallen, causing its implied valuation to drop from $95 billion to $74 billion. In November 2022, the company announced it intended to initiate layoffs, terminating some 14% of their workforce.

Throughout 2022 and 2023, the company announced a number of large enterprise customers including Airbnb, Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, BMW, Maersk, Zara, Lotus, Alaska Airlines, Le Monde, and Toyota. The company also announced in March 2023 that OpenAI is working with Stripe to commercialize its generative AI technology.

In January 2025, Stripe sent layoff notices to nearly 300 workers, primarily affecting roles in Product, Operations and Engineering. The company got struck in a controversy, when the company sent a cartoon picture of a duck to the laid-off employees. Stripe's Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh later apologized for the mistake.

### Payment processing

Stripe provides application programming interfaces that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications. The company introduced Stripe Connect in 2012, a multiparty payments solution that lets software developers embed payments natively into their products.

In April 2018, Stripe released antifraud tools, branded "Radar", that block fraudulent transactions. The same year, it expanded its services to include a billing product for online businesses, allowing businesses to manage subscription recurring revenue and invoicing.

Stripe's point-of-sale service called Terminal was made available to US users on June 11, 2019. Terminal had previously been invitation-only. Terminal is currently available in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. The service offers physical credit-card readers designed to work with Stripe.

On September 5, 2019, Stripe launched a merchant cash-advance scheme called Stripe Capital. The scheme allows Stripe merchants to request an advance on future payments they expect to process through their Stripe merchant account.

In June 2021, the company launched Stripe Tax, which lets businesses automatically calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST in over 30 countries and all US states. In May that year, Stripe introduced Payment Links, a no-code product allowing businesses to create a link to a checkout page and begin accepting payments on social platforms or direct channels.

In January 2022, Stripe agreed to acquire Terminal manufacturing partner BBPOS, allowing the company to bring the hardware development of Terminal readers in-house. In February, it was announced as Apple's first partner on in-person Tap to Pay, which enables businesses to accept contactless payments using an iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app. In May, Stripe announced Data Pipeline, a tool for Stripe users who store data with Amazon Redshift or Snowflake Data Cloud.

That month, the company also introduced Stripe Financial Connections, enabling businesses to establish direct connections with their customers’ bank accounts to verify accounts for payments and payouts, check balances to reduce payment failures, and cut fraud by confirming bank account ownership. In September 2023, Stripe announced that its optimized checkout suite allowed businesses to offer their customers more than 100 payment methods.


### Corporate finance

In July 2018, Stripe introduced Stripe Issuing, a product that allows online businesses and platforms to create their own physical and digital credit and debit cards.

On February 24, 2016, the company launched the Atlas platform to help startups register as US corporations, targeting foreign entrepreneurs. The platform was originally invitation-only. In March 2016, Cuba was added to the list of countries covered under the program. Originally, companies registered using Atlas were set up as Delaware-based C corporations. As of April 30, 2018, the option to be registered as limited liability companies was added. Companies set up using Atlas automatically had a business bank account and Stripe merchant account set up.


### Link

Link, a service for saving and autofilling payment details when paying via Stripe, was launched by Stripe in May 2021.

The service supported payments in over 185 countries and Stripe reported plans to make it available to platform businesses through its API.


### Other

In 2018, Stripe started a publishing company named Stripe Press to promote ideas that support businesses.

In 2019, Stripe began offering loans and credit cards to businesses in the United States. The company stated that loans are approved automatically using machine-learning models, with no human intervention. The following year, the company introduced Stripe Treasury, which provides its platform users APIs to embed financial services, allowing their customers to send, receive, and store funds.

In October 2020, Stripe announced Stripe Climate, a service for businesses to fund atmospheric carbon research and capture. In 2022, Stripe started a new subsidiary called Frontier that would direct spending on carbon removal. It announced $925 million in funding from major Silicon Valley companies to fund start up companies performing carbon capture to kick-start the industry.

Stripe Identity, launched in June 2021, enables online businesses to verify user identities and is built on the same infrastructure used for Stripe's own risk and compliance program.

Stripe also announced Financial Connections to help businesses connect to their customers’ bank accounts for verifying bank accounts, checking balances, and confirming account ownership.

At launch, the Marketplace had over 50 apps including offerings from DocuSign, Dropbox, Intercom, Mailchimp, Ramp, and Xero. While the marketplace was launched in May, app installations were not available immediately.

The move followed Stripe's acquisition of OpenChannel, a company which built app ecosystems for businesses, in December 2021.
