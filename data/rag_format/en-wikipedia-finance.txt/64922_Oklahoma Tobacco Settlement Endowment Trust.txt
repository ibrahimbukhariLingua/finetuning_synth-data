Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust


# Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust



The **Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust** is a public trust created by the State of Oklahoma to manage any money from settlements or lawsuits against any tobacco company. Its creation can be attributed to a decision by Oklahoma voters in November 2000 to constitutionally set aside and protect the majority of settlement funds as an endowment trust fund. The statewide ballot question ensured that only earnings on investments from the TSET were to be spent and then only for tobacco prevention, cancer research, and other health-related programs. The Trust uses the money, through grants and programs, to improve the health and quality of life of all Oklahomans by funding programs and services that address, prevent and reduce tobacco use and obesity – health behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of death in Oklahoma, cancer and cardiovascular disease. TSET has statewide grants, local community-based grants and public health education interventions that include Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline, Tobacco Stops With Me and Shape Your Future.
