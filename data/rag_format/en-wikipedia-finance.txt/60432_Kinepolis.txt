**The Kinepolis Group** is a Belgian cinema chain with 110 theaters in Europe and North America. It is Europe’s third-largest cinema chain.


## History

The **Kinepolis** Group is a Belgian cinema chain formed in 1997 as a result of the merger of two family cinema groups, Bert and Claeys, and has been listed on the stock exchange since 1998.

The first megaplex cinema in the world is considered to be Kinepolis Brussels located near the Atomium in Brussels, Belgium, which opened in 1988 with 25 screens and 7,600 seats.

On 17 September 1998, the world's largest cinema megaplex, Kinepolis Madrid Ciudad de la Imagen, opened in Spain, with 25 screens and 9,200 seating capacity, with each seating between 211 and 996 people.

In 2006, the Claeys family withdrew from the venture, selling most of its 25% stake of shares in the company and transferring daily management to Joost Bert, who, since 2008, shares the position of CEO with Eddy Duquenne.


### Competition authority

The Belgian competition authority approved the merger of the company in 1997 on the condition that the company wasn't allowed to grow within Belgium without explicit consent of the authority. This resulted in the resale of the acquired Utopolis cinemas in 2015. Kinepolis tried on several occasions to get the authority to lift the ban, and they succeeded in 2020. From August 2021 the company doesn't need permission to open new locations within Belgium.


### Growth and acquisitions

Kinepolis grew significantly in recent years by opening several new locations, but also by acquiring chains and independent cinemas. Significant acquisitions were *Wolff Bioscopen* in 2014, *Utopolis* in 2015, *Landmark Cinemas* in 2017 and *MJR Digital Cinemas* in 2019.

In 2011 the company also acquired *Brightfish*, a Belgian company specialised in cinema advertising.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
