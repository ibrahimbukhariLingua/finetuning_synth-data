## History

Altana Federal Credit Union (then Laurel Federal Credit Union) started in 1949 out of an empty railcar in Laurel, Montana. Several refinery workers joined and started the credit union as a way to safeguard themselves from the high cost of banking services. The first loan given was to purchase a sewing machine. Credit unions merged into Altana FCU include:

* Mountain States FCU – a credit union that served a Select Employer Group (SEG) that included employees of USWest and AT&T.
* Montana Media Credit Union – a credit union that served a Select Employer Group (SEG) that included people who worked in the media industry.
* Northwest Humble FCU – a credit union that served a Select Employer Group (SEG) that included employees of Exxon.
* Summit FCU – originally Yellowstone Teachers Credit Union, they served teachers, faculty and students for area schools before expanding to a community charter.
* BearPaw FCU - established in 1942 for Great Northern Railway employees — eventually expanding to their families, then to Havre as a whole, then to county and surrounding counties over the coming decades
