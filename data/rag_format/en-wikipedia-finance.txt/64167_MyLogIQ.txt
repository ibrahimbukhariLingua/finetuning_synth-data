## Business

The company offers financial data (XBRL, as reported) and on-demand solutions through its SEC Analyzer software as a service (SAAS) to accounting firms, corporations, law firms, and investment professionals.

## History

The company was founded in San Jose, California in 2001.
Since 2001, MyLogIQ has focused on mining unstructured data from SEC filings, converting that data into structured information.

* 2002 - MyLogIQ began extracting executive compensation and corporate governance information from SEC filings for US companies, in addition to providing data and business intelligence applications to major human resource consulting firms.
* 2005 - under the brand name GuerdonData, MyLogIQ began providing data and business intelligence solutions based on Australian executive compensation and corporate governance information disclosed to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).
* 2006 - MyLogIQ licensed proprietary technology to Thompson-Reuters, enabling them to replace manual, labor-intensive data collection processes with their automated, technology-enabled processes. MyLogIQ's technology allowed them to precisely and quickly extract fundamental data and information from companies' annual and quarterly filings, current events (8-K) filings, and earnings releases filed with the SEC and SEDAR (Canada).
* 2008-09 - at an XBRL conference, MyLogIQ's proprietary technology produced the first full XBRL compliant report (fundamental tables and all footnote disclosures) mapped to historical financial data. Equipped with a historical database, they help hedge funds and banks identify critical money-making trends.
* 2010 - MyLogIQ introduced the SEC Analyzer Research Platform. Powered by a decade of experience, the SEC Analyzer delivers precise compliance and disclosure intelligence to markets all over the world.
