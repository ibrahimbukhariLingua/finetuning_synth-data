## Early life and education

A first-generation college student, Beaulier was born and raised in Iron Mountain, Michigan, hometown of Tom Izzo and Steve Mariucci.

He attended Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Michigan and became interested in economics when he took a course taught by David Prychitko. After completing a B.A. (2000) in economics and history at NMU, Beaulier attended George Mason University where he earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. (2004) in economics. His dissertation focused on economic development and the role robust institutions play in human flourishing and was supervised by Peter Boettke.

After receiving his doctoral degree, Beaulier taught at several institutions, including Mercer University, Beloit College, Troy University, and Arizona State University. In 2016, he became one of America's youngest business deans when he joined North Dakota State University as Dean of the College of Business and Professor of Economics. In his six years at NDSU, Beaulier led the College of Business through two AACSB accreditation reviews, secured historic philanthropic support for the College of Business, and helped to launch the Sheila & Robert Challey Institute for Global Innovation and Growth, which was the largest investment in people--faculty and students--in NDSU history. In 2019, Beaulier became the first named dean in NDSU history when he assumed the role of the Ronald & Kaye Olson Dean of Business. In July, 2022, Beaulier left NDSU after six years as Dean of Business to assume the role of Dean of Business at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming.
