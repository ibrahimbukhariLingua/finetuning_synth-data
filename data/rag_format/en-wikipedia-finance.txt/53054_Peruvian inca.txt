Peruvian inca


# Peruvian inca



The **inca** was a unit of currency in Peru between 1881 and 1882. The inca was issued in banknote form only and was subdivided into 10 *reales de inca* or 100 *centavos de inca*. It was replaced by the Peruvian sol at a rate of 1 inca = 10 soles. The banknotes were withdrawn in 1882.


## Banknotes

The inca appeared on two series of banknotes, one consisting of overprints on earlier notes, the other a regular issue. The overprinted denominations were 1 real de inca, surcharged on old 1 sol notes, 5 reales de inca, stamped on old 5 soles notes, and 100 centavos de inca (i.e., 1 inca), surcharged on old 100 soles notes. The regular issue of notes was in denominations of 1, 5 and 100 incas. Some of the regular issue 5 and 10 inca notes were later surcharged with their value in soles.
