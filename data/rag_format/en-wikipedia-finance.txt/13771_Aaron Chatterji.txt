From 2010–2011, Chatterji served as a Senior Economist in President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. His policy portfolio centered around entrepreneurship and innovation.


### 2020 North Carolina Treasurer Election

In the 2020 North Carolina elections, Chatterji entered his first race for public office, running for North Carolina State Treasurer. On March 3, 2020, Chatterji beat Dimple Ajmera and Matthew Leatherman in the Democratic primary for the party's formal nomination in the general election against Republican incumbent Dale Folwell.

Chatterji's campaign platform centered around three main pillars: (1) greater outcome-driven expansion of healthcare (including Medicaid) throughout the state, (2) modernization of the North Carolina Retirement Systems, and (3) the reorganization of the investment fund management including the hiring of a permanent Chief Investment Officer.

Chatterji's campaign received endorsement from President Obama, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, and then-vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Locally, Chatterji received endorsements from the North Carolina state AFL-CIO, the People's Alliance, the Committee on the Affairs of Black People, and the Raleigh-Wake Citizens Association.

Folwell ultimately defeated Chatterji in the November general election by a 52.6% to 47.4% margin.
