## Architecture

Consisting of 11,000 square meters, this unique building is the first of its kind to be built in India with its colored façade and unmistakable identity. Designed by architect Abin Chaudhuri, the concept was to insert a burst of color in the city's monotonous dense urban fabric, representing the colors of the sky. To achieve the colors in the glass facade, Vanceva PBB has been used as the sandwich material between two layers of glass. The colored laminate on the façade follows no repetitive pattern and is symbolic of the unpredictable nature of the sky. It also represents the vibrancy of today's youth. An integrated plaza with a water body has been designed. The water body receives no direct sunlight and creates a comfortable micro-climate. Wherever possible shading trees have been planted on the hard landscape and soft landscape has been introduced.
