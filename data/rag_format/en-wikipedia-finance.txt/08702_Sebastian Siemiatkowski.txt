**Sebastian Siemiatkowski** (also spelled **Sebastian Siemiątkowski**; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish entrepreneur and former billionaire who is the co-founder and chief executive officer of fintech company Klarna.


## Early life

Siemiatkowski's parents moved to Uppsala from Poland in the 1980s. He was born on 3 October 1981 in Sweden but his older sister was born in Poland.

Siemiatkowski considers himself as a second generation immigrant. His early influences were Richard Branson and Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA. Siemiatkowski credits the Swedish digital policy of subsidizing the ownership of computers for his success because it allowed his family to acquire their first computer.


## Education and career

Siemiatkowski attended high school at Katedralskolan, Uppsala. He holds a master's degree from the Stockholm School of Economics.

He started building Klarna at age 23 and co-founded the company with Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson in 2005. Siemiatkowski had met one of his co-founders when working at Burger King.

In 2022, as Klarna laid of 10% of its employees as it experienced financial difficulty, Siemiatkowski publicly posted a list of employees who were recently dismissed by the company publicising their email addresses in the process. This was criticised as tone deaf by commentators. The Swedish Financial Sector Union expressed regret to have learnt about the job cuts from the media rather than being consulted beforehand and sued the company over the layoffs.

Siemiatkowski owns about 7% of Klarna, which made him a billionaire, although after Klarna experienced difficulties its lower valuation meant that, as of 2023, he was no longer a billionaire.


## Future of work

In December 2024, he stated that the company stopped hiring people last year because "*AI can do all of the jobs that we humans do. It’s just a question of how we apply it and use it”*.


## Personal life

Siemiatkowski married Nina, a marketing executive he first met while attending the Stockholm School of Economics, in 2014. She is the founder of a digital platform to connect donors with local nonprofits and played a key role in identifying a marketing agency that created Klarna's branding. They have three children and live in Stockholm.
