## History

TradeGecko was launched in 2013 by Carl Thompson and brothers Cameron and Bradley Priest, three New Zealanders.

Thompson, who ran the label Crowded Elevator, saw the need for a solution in managing inventory administration and made the decision to create one.

The trio went through the JFDI.Asia Accelerate program before going on to raise a round of financing through from Singapore-based investors. In April 2015, TradeGecko raised $6.5 million series A round led by NSI Ventures and Jungle Ventures.
