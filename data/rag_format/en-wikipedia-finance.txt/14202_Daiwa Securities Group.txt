## History


### Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets

The company was founded in 1999 as Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets Co. Ltd., a joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group (Daiwa) and Sumitomo Bank (SB). It was renamed in 2001 to Daiwa Securities SMBC Co. Ltd., after Sumitomo Bank merged with Sakura Bank on 1 April 2001 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG). However, in 2010, SMBC acquired Nikko Cordial (Japan's third-largest brokerage at that time).


### Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Company

Following this step, Daiwa dissolved the joint-venture with SMBC and re-acquired 100% of the shares in the company, before renaming it again as Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. Ltd. Finally, about two years later, the company was absorbed in a merger, leaving Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd as the sole entity.


### DC Advisory

In May 2009, Daiwa acquired the corporate finance division of Close Brothers Group. In 2010, it was renamed to DC Advisory and now acts as the corporate finance arm of Daiwa.
