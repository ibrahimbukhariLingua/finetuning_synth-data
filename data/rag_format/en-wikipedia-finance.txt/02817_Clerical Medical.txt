Clerical Medical


# Clerical Medical



**Clerical Medical** is a British life assurance, pensions and investments company founded in 1824, and a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group.


## History

In 1824, Dr George Pinckard formed a committee of physicians and members of the clergy which published a pamphlet called 'Prospectus for the Establishment of a new Assurance Office with Improved Arrangements'. On 18 June 1824, the Medical, Clerical and General Life Assurance Society was formed. Pinckard was appointed as Chairman, the Marquis of Huntly as President, and Pinckard's brother Joseph as Resident Secretary and Actuary. A board of directors, which included eight eminent physicians was also appointed. The company's first policy was issued to Richard Pinckard, a nephew of Dr George Pinckard.

In 1855, the company moved its headquarters to Lichfield House in St James's Square, London.

Clerical Medical acquired the General Reversionary and Investment Company in 1913, and in 1920 a merger with the Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation took place. In 1961 by the **Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Act 1961** (9 & 10 Eliz. 2. c. xii), Clerical Medical became a mutual office.

In 1975, the company moved its head office from St James's Square, London to Bristol.

Following the decision to demutualise the company in 1995, Clerical Medical merged with the Halifax in 1996, and was later absorbed into HBOS plc in 2001.

HBOS was bought by Lloyds TSB Group in January 2009. The resulting company, Lloyds Banking Group, announced in April 2009 that the Clerical Medical brand would eventually be phased out in favour of its Scottish Widows subsidiary.

In 2015, Lloyds Banking Group sold Clerical Medical International (CMI) to offshore life assurance company RL360Â°.
