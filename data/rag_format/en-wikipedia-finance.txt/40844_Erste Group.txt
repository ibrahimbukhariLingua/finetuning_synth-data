Erste Group


# Erste Group



**Erste Group Bank AG** (shortened version **Erste Group**) is an Austrian financial service provider. It is one of the largest financial service providers in Central and Eastern Europe serving more than 16 million clients in over 2,000 branches in seven countries. Erste Group is headquartered in Vienna and operates as a universal bank.

Erste Group is the central entity of the Sparkassengruppe Österreich (Austrian Savings Banks Group) and the Österreichischer Sparkassenverband. It has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank. The main shareholder of Erste Group is the non-profit ERSTE Foundation.

In 1997, Erste Group went public and today the company is listed on the exchanges of Vienna, Prague and Bucharest and included in the indices *CEETX*, ATX and PX.


## History

The origins of Erste Group are in the founding of the Erste österreichische Spar-Casse in October 1819 in Leopoldstadt, a suburb of Vienna.

The IPO in Vienna in 1997 was conducted under the unified Erste Bank, which also handled subsequent capital increases until 2006. Some of these transactions were the largest of their kind ever executed in Vienna's financial market. The capital raised was used to finance Erste Bank's acquisitions in Central and Eastern Europe.

On 9 August 2008, the former *Erste Bank Oesterreich* was split up into the newly founded holding company *Erste Group Bank AG* and the subsidiary *Erste Bank der österreichischen Sparkassen AG*; the foreign subsidiaries were taken over by the new holding company. From then on, Erste Group included all companies of the group.


## Expansion into Central and Eastern Europe


### Austria

In 1996, Salzburger Sparkasse was incorporated into the banking group. Shortly before the turn of the millennium, Sparkasse Oberösterreich took over all Upper Austrian branches from Erste Bank, whereupon 26% of the shares in the now largest federal state savings bank were gained. In 2000, Erste Bank acquired a 25% stake in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse. In December 2001, 51% of the Tiroler Sparkasse was obtained. In October 2007, shares in Bausparkasse der österreichischen Sparkassen were purchased; in 2021, the remaining shares were acquired.

In 2021, the Erste Bank Group still held 39.19% of the shares in Sparkasse Oberösterreich. By the beginning of 2024, the shares had fallen to 16.84%.

The shareholdings of Salzburger Sparkasse, Sparkasse Oberösterreich and Tiroler Sparkasse are still owned by Erste Bank, not Erste Group.

In April of the same year, the remaining 10% was acquired by the Slovakian state government. On January 1, 2005, the remaining 19.99% of SLSP was purchased by the EBRD.


### Croatia

The acquisition of 61.88% in Banca Comercială Română *S.A.* (BCR), the largest Romanian bank with 2.8 million customers and 12,000 employees, for EUR 3.751 billion in December 2005 was the largest foreign direct investment ever by an Austrian enterprise. Further shares in the Romanian bank were acquired in 2007 (7.2%) and 2012 (24%), and in June 2018 the stake held by Erste Bank increased from 93.58 % to 99.88 %. *Banca Comercială Română* has over 7,000 employees.


### Serbia

### Effects of the financial crisis

In October 2011, Erste Bank said it expected a full year loss of up to EUR 1.1 billion, after writedowns and provisions of EUR 1.6 billion. This would be its first loss since at least 1988. It said the writedowns were due to government intervention in Hungary, where it was forced to take losses on Swiss franc mortgages, and a slower than expected recovery in Romania. In August 2013, Erste Group Bank AG was the first Austrian bank to fully repay the participation capital of EUR 1.76 billion issued in 2009 which consisted of EUR 1.22 billion from the Republic of Austria and EUR 540 million from private investors. From 2009 to 2012, the Republic of Austria received annual dividend payments from Erste Group of EUR 98 million and private investors of EUR 43 million. Including the pro rata dividend for 2013 which paid in June 2014 after the corresponding resolution is passed by the annual shareholders' meeting, the Republic of Austria received EUR 448 million and private investors EUR 198 million in dividends.
