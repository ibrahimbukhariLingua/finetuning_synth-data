Bolivian boliviano


# Bolivian boliviano



The **boliviano** ([boliˈβjano]; sign: **Bs** ISO 4217 code: **BOB**) is the currency of Bolivia. It is divided into 100 cents or centavos in Spanish. Boliviano was also the name of the currency of Bolivia between 1864 and 1963. From April 2018, the manager of the Central Bank of Bolivia, Pablo Ramos, announced the introduction of the new family of banknotes of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, started with the 10 Bs note, and then gradually arrived to introduce the 200 Bs note, presented in April 2019. The new family of banknotes of the Plurinational State received several awards such as "the best banknotes in Latin America", was highlighted by its security measures, its aesthetics and its inclusion of prominent figures in Bolivian history, being among those who awarded the "Latin American High Security Printing Press Conference".


## History

Currencies in use before the current second boliviano include:

* The *Spanish real* from the 16th to 19th centuries, with 8 reales equal to 1 peso and 16 reales equal to 1 escudo.
* The *Bolivian sol* from 1827 to 1864, replacing the Spanish real at par. 16 soles were equal to 1 *Bolivian escudo*, and 8 soles were equal to 1 boliviano.
* The *first boliviano* from 1864 to 1963, worth eight *soles* and divided into 100 *centécimos* (later *centavos*). The name bolivar was used for an amount of ten bolivianos.
* The *peso boliviano* (code BOP), from 1963 to 1986, worth 1,000 first bolivianos.

The second boliviano was introduced in 1987 at a rate of 1 boliviano = 1,000,000 *pesos bolivianos*.


## Second boliviano

Following many years of rampant inflation, the bolivian peso was replaced in 1987 by a new boliviano at a rate of one million to one (when 1 US dollar was worth 1.8/1.9 million pesos). At that time, 1 new boliviano was roughly equivalent to 1⁄2 U.S. dollar.


### Coins

In 1988, stainless-steel 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos and 1 boliviano (dated 1987) coins were introduced, followed by stainless-steel 2 bolivianos in 1991. Copper-plated steel 10 centavos were introduced in 1997 and bi-metallic 5 bolivianos in 2001. The 2 and 5 centavo coins are no longer in circulation. The 2 boliviano coin has been minted in two sizes, both of which remain legal tender. The smaller 2 boliviano coin is almost the same as the 1 boliviano coin, leading to potential confusion, although the 2 boliviano coins are undecagonal whilst the 1 boliviano coins are round.
All the coins in Bolivia have the value with the inscription "La union es la Fuerza" ("Union is strength" in Spanish) on the obverse. Older coins feature and the coat of arms of Bolivia with the inscription "Republica de Bolivia" (Republic of Bolivia) on the reverse, while newer ones feature the coat of arms with the inscription "Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia" (Plurinational state of Bolivia).

## Exchange rates

In a fixed exchange rate regime system, the Central Bank of Bolivia undertakes to buy and sell foreign currency at the price it previously set of Bs 6.86 for the purchase and Bs 6.96 for the sale for 1 $US respectively. from November 2011 to the present, which is more than eleven continuous years. The consequences of this system are crucial, although in practice they are not understood in their real dimension of its effects in the short and long term on the country's economy. Since 2023 in Bolivia there has been a shortage of United States dollar, so the "parallel" dollar began to settle in streets and some exchange houses, reaching an exchange rate of Bs 8.90 for sale for 1 $US. although the Central Bank of Bolivia enabled the option of carry out the sale of dollars in their offices at the official price.

## Manufacture and production

As of 2013 boliviano coins and banknotes are still being produced abroad, in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Chile, even though Bolivia has been politically independent since 1825.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Though Bolivia was one of the main mints of the colonial era (casa de la moneda, Potosí) the coining and printing of currency stopped due to lack of political interest and on the idea that foreign made coins and banknotes could be acquired at a lower price than the Bolivian-made coins and banknotes.
