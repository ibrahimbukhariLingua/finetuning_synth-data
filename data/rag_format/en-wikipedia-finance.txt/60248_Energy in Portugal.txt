Energy in Portugal


# Energy in Portugal

 

**Energy in Portugal** describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in Portugal. Energy policy of Portugal will describe the politics of Portugal related to energy more in detail. Electricity sector in Portugal is the main article of electricity in Portugal.

In 2000, 85% of energy was imported. In 2021 the last coal fired power station closed and renewable energy was expanded to fill the gap. A target of being carbon neutral by 2050 has been set.

## Energy plans

Portugal aims to be climate neutral by 2050 and to cover 80% of its electricity consumption with renewables by 2030.

Portugal has also developed a hydrogen strategy to decrease natural gas imports and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.


## Energy sources


### Fossil fuels


#### Coal

Sines power plant (hard coal) started operation in 1985–1989 in Portugal. According to WWF its CO₂ emissions were among the top dirty ones in Portugal in 2007. That coal power plant went offline in January 2021, with the one remaining coal power plant in the country, closing at 7h15 on the 19th of November 2021.


#### Natural gas

Maghreb–Europe Gas Pipeline (MEG) is a natural gas pipeline, from Algeria through Morocco to Andalusia, Spain.

Portugal has the Sines LNG import terminal to facilitate gas imports. There are three LNG storage tanks with a total capacity of 390,000 cbm and a regasification capacity of 5.6 mtpa. In 2021 Portugal imported 2.8 billion cubic meters of LNG from Nigeria, being almost 50% of the country's gas imports for the year.


### Renewable energy

Years in which the last three renewable power levels achieved
| Achievement | Year | Achievement | Year | Achievement | Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20% | 2006 | 25% | 2010 | 30% | 2020 |

Renewable energy includes wind, solar, biomass and geothermal energy sources.

Energy from renewable sources has been increasing in Portugal since 2000 and has been given a boost with the 2030 renewable energy target.


#### Solar power

Portugal has supported and increased the solar electricity (Photovoltaic power) and solar thermal energy (solar heating) during 2006–2010. Portugal was 9th in solar heating in the EU and 8th in solar power based on total volume in 2010.

The largest solar farm in Europe is being built in Santiago do Cacém near Sines, creating up to 2,500 jobs, mostly local, it will be completed in 2025 and have a generating capacity of 1.2 GW.


#### Wind power

Wind energy capacity in Portugal is over 5,000 MW from onshore wind farms. In 2023, plans for the first floating offshore wind farm were announced.


#### Biomass

Biomass provides around 8% of electricity generation capacity.


### Hydro power

Portugal has also been using water power to generate power for the country. In the 2010s, a local company, Wave Roller installed many devices along the coast to make use of the water power.

In 2021, 36% of Portugal’s total installed power generation capacity and 23% of total power generation came from hydro power.

Drought can seriously reduce hydro energy generation in the summer months.


### Nuclear power

Portugal does not produce any electricity from nuclear sources.


## Transport

The sustainable strategy has been a shift from individual to collective transport within the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Metro Lisbon (ML), collective buses, Companhia Carris de ferro de Lisboa).


## Global warming

| CO₂ emissions in 2009 (million tonnes) | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CO₂ | People (million) |
| Chile | 66 | 16.8 |
| Belarus | 61 | 9.7 |
| Syria | 57 | 21.2 |
| Turkmenistan | 57 | 5.0 |
| **Portugal** | 57 | 10.6 |
| Bangladesh | 55 | 160.0 |
| Libya | 55 | 6.3 |
| Serbia | 52 | 7.4 |
| Finland | 52 | 5.3 |

According to Energy Information Administration the CO₂ emissions from energy consumption of Portugal were in 2009 56.5 Mt, slightly over Bangladesh with 160 million people and Finland with 5.3 million people. The emissions per capita were (tonnes): Portugal 5.58, India 1.38, China 5.83, Europe 7.14, Russia 11.23, North America 14.19, Singapore 34.59 and United Arab Emirates 40.31.
