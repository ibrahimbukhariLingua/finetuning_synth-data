Global ATM Alliance


# Global ATM Alliance



The **Global ATM Alliance** is a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of their banks to use their automated teller machine (ATM) card or debit card at another bank within the alliance with no international ATM access fees. Other fees, such as an international transaction or foreign currency fee, may still apply for some account holders. Participating banks are located around the globe.

The participating banks are as follows. Some of the listed banks, however, may honor ATM reciprocity only in one country for certain allied banks, e.g., fees may not be charged for Barclays branches in the United Kingdom, but fees may be charged for branches of Barclays in other countries.

* The "non-Bank of America usage fee" for each withdrawal, transfer, or balance inquiry at non-Bank of America ATMs outside the United States. This fee is waived under the Global ATM Alliance within the following coverage areas.
* The "ATM operator access fee". This fee is waived under the Global ATM Alliance within the following coverage areas.
