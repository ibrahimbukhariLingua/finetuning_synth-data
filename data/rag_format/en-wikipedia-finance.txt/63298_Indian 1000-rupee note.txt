Indian 1000-rupee note


# Indian 1000-rupee note



The **Indian 1000-rupee banknote** (₹1000) is an obsolete denomination of the Indian rupee. It was first introduced by the Reserve Bank of India in 1938 under British rule and subsequently demonetized in 1946. Post-independence, the denomination was re-introduced in 1954. In January 1978, all high-denomination banknotes of ₹1000, ₹5000, and ₹10000 were demonetized in order to curb unaccounted cash money.

In order to contain the volume of banknotes in circulation due to inflation, the ₹1000 banknote was again re-introduced in November 2000, under the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as a part of the Mahatma Gandhi Series of banknotes; these were demonetized on 8 November 2016 by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, with the claimed reasons of preventing the issue of counterfeit currency and to fight corruption and black money in India.
