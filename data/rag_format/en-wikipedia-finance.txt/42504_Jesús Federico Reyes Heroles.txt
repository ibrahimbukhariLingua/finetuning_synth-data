In December 1994, President Ernesto Zedillo appointed him director-general of the Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Públicos (BANOBRAS), the development bank for infrastructure. In 1995, Zedillo chose him as Secretary of Energy; he left that position in October 1997 when he was appointed Ambassador to the United States, where he served until November 2000.

In the run-up to the 2006 general election he publicly expressed his opposition to the nomination of the PRI's Roberto Madrazo and support for the National Action Party presidential candidate, Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, although he did not renounce his party membership.
