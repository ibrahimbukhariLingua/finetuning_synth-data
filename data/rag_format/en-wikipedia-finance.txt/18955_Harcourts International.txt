# Harcourts International



**Harcourts** (/ˈhɑːrkɔːrts/) is a global Australasian real estate company established in 1888 in Wellington, New Zealand by John Bateman Harcourt. Harcourts operates in 11 countries with 908 offices.


## History

John Bateman Harcourt established the Harcourts real estate company in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1888. From 1874 John had been a partner in the merchant partnership A. P. Stuart & Co., which he bought out in 1879.

Initially, Harcourts focused on the sale of city property, as well as country, seaside, mining, farms and station properties and had a strong auction presence. In its early stages, the company introduced "The Register and Property Investors Guide", the equivalent of Bluebook. It published and circulated about 4,000 copies throughout Wellington monthly.

In 1905, John Bateman Harcourt’s sons Stanton and Gordon joined the company. In 1929, Gordon founded his own company, Gordon Harcourt Ltd, while Stanton headed Harcourt & Co. After Stanton's retirement in the 1950s, Hec Fisher headed the company. In 1980 Harcourt & Co expanded into Auckland and announced listing on the Stock Exchange.

In 1985, the company merged with Collins Real Estate to form Harcourts Real Estate Ltd. and became one of the largest real estate companies in the country.

In 1988, Stephen Collins introduced Harcourts’ current franchise model and made Harcourts a publicly listed company. National Bank of New Zealand was one of the first shareholders. It continued to purchase shares, leading to the return to private ownership. The next year, Tower Corporation purchased the shares from the National Bank. Stephen Collins, in 1992, conducted a management buyout together with Paul Wright, Bob Cooper, and Jo-Anne Clifford.

In 1996 the company launched the first public searchable property database on the internet. The following year, Harcourts entered the Australian market.

In 2002, it launched Harcourts Academy, a training academy providing courses for sales, management and administration for the real estate industry, which later became an RTO (Registered Training Organisation) of which it still operates today as the Harcourts Real Estate Training Centre.

In 2008, the company launched its own charity, The Harcourts Foundation. Operating in a number of the same markets the Harcourts residential real estate brand does, The Harcourts Foundation has raised millions of dollars in support of more than 1,340 charities, something it continues with today and includes major support for organisations including Gumboot Friday, Hospice New Zealand and Beyond Blue.

In 2020, Harcourts undertook a global re-brand that included a new logo, brand colours, fonts and overall office and brand presentation design. This re-brand coincided with the launch of ‘Find where you belong’ as their global brand position under the umbrella of ‘Your, Our’ Harcourts.

In 2024, Harcourts completed the network-wide, global rollout of its new brand position: “We make it possible.”


## International expansion

Harcourts established branches across New Zealand while simultaneously focusing on expanding into the Australian market. In 1997, former Harcourts franchise owners, Mike and Irene Green, initiated this expansion by establishing a presence in Australia. Within a few years, Harcourts successfully opened offices in all six Australian states, becoming one of the fastest-growing real estate companies in Australasia. Mike Green, during his tenure as Managing Director from 2009 to 2019, contributed to the company's international development. Since Mike and Paul Wright assumed leadership in 1999, Harcourts has continued its international expansion, now setting up over 900 offices worldwide.
