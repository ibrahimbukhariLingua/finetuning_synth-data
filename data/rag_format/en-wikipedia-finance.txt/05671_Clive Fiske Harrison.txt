# Clive Fiske Harrison



**Clive Fiske Harrison** (born 23 November 1939) is a retired English stockbroker. For half a century, he was senior partner, then chief executive and latterly chairman of Fiske plc, the oldest remaining independent stockbroking firm in the City of London.


## Early life

According to *Debrett's*, Fiske Harrison was educated at Felsted School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and worked at Panmure Gordon, as a stockbroker, alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron's father Ian Cameron, before joining Fiske & Co in the early 1970s.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Fiske & Co

In 1975, Fiske & Co merged with stockbrokers Bragg, Stockdale, Hall & Co, founded in 1824, and headed by Michael Brudenell-Bruce, 8th Marquess of Ailesbury. (Lord Ailebsury became a partner at Fiske & Co, and later joined the board when it became a limited company.) Fiske has grown to almost a billion pounds under investment, became a publicly listed company in 2000, Fiske plc, and was named the top British stockbroker by the financial news service Bloomberg the following year.

Although the merger was of the two equal partners, according to *The Times*, the new concern opted to take the name of Fiske & Co. Following the acquisition of all older firms such as Quilter & Co, founded in 1777, Cazenove & Co and James Capel & Co, both founded in 1823 (and even Panmure Gordon & Co, founded 1876), Fiske remains the oldest independent stockbroking house in the City of London today.

Its chairman was long known to take a sceptical view of the market, leading the City Editor of *The Times* to comment in January 2009: "One person whose views I respect is Clive Fiske Harrison who runs Fiske & Co, the stockbroker. He has spent no less than 47 years in the stock market. In a letter to clients and friends just before Christmas he warned that the market's reaction to the present problems was still relatively modest in the context of past crises and almost certainly had further to go." Three years later the City Editor of the *Evening Standard* congratulated him on his half century, pointing out that he had joined Panmure Gordon at the same time as the famously long serving David Mayhew who became chairman of Cazenove & Co, later J.P. Morgan Cazenove, but even he had retired the year before.


## Family

According to *Burke's*, he is a relation of Major Fiske Goodeve Fiske-Harrison of Copford Hall in Copford, Essex, High Sheriff of Essex, and himself resides in the nearby village of Layer de la Haye and also in Eaton Square in Belgravia, London. He has three sons. His son Jules was, according to *The Times*, a "famously skilled and fearless skier" who died in a skiing accident in Zermatt, Switzerland in 1988 and his son Alexander is an author and bullfighter.
