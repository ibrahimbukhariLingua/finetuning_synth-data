### Minister of Economics and Finance

He became Minister of Finance in 2015 under Yahya Ould Hademine, with his portfolio later extending to also cover the Ministry of Economics following a cabinet reshuffle.

His name was considered in 2018 as a potential candidate to succeed Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz due to his close ties to the president, however Mohamed Ould Ghazouani became candidate instead. He was nominated by Ghazouani to become the Director of SNIM in September 2019, holding the office until March 2021.


### Head of the President's Office
