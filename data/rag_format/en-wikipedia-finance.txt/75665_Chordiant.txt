## History

Chordiant originally began under the name J. Frank Consulting, a consulting company. In 1997, they transformed into a software company and re-branded as Chordiant Software. In February 2000, they went public and traded under NASDAQ. The company's stock hit an initial high point of $53 shortly after going public, but soon crashed to single digits months later as the software industry in general suffered a significant decline.

Initially, Chordiant's software was developed on Forte 4GL platform. After seeing the promise of the emerging Java EE technologies, the company moved their software to a Java-based platform and became one of the first packaged enterprise software vendors to ship a completely Java EE-based product suite.

On March 15, 2010, Pegasystems, a competing company, announced it had acquired Chordiant for a price of approximately $161.5 million.
