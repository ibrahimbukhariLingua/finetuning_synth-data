Polynesian Navigation Company


# Polynesian Navigation Company



The **Polynesian Navigation Company** (*Société de Navigation Polynesiènne*) (SNP) is a shipping company in French Polynesia which operates routes between Tahiti and the Leeward Islands and Tuamotus. It is a subsidiary of the Martin Group.

In May 2014 SNP acquired the assets of the *Société de transport insulaire maritime* (STIM), including the ferries *Hawaikinui* and *Nuku Hau*, following the latter's receivership.

In 2017 SNP applied to the Polynesian Competition Authority for approval to purchase the Taporo fleet, which would hae given it a monopoly on shipping to the Leeward Islands. Approval was granted, subject to a requirement that SNP sell two vessels to maintain competition. This condition led to the collapse of the deal.

In 2019 the company was granted a fuel tax refund to subsidise the *Hawaikinui'*s service to the Leeward Islands.

In March 2022 it announced the construction of a new ferry, *Hawaikinui 2*, which is expected to replace *Hawaikinui* in 2025. In March 2023 its new ship, *Hava'i*, arrived in Papeete for use on the Leeward islands route. In April 2023 it applied to the Polynesian Competition Authority for approval to buy *Transport maritime des Tuamotu Ouest*, operators of the *Mareva Nui*. Approval was granted in June 2023.
