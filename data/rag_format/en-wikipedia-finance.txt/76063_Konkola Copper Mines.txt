## History

The company declared insolvency in early 2019. Later that year, 1,826 Zambians obtained permission from the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in its *Lungowe v Vedanta Resources plc* ruling to sue Vedanta for local water pollution caused by KCM that started in 2005. Also in 2019, Lusaka High Court of Zambia blocked the sale of Konkola's assts by the company's liquidator. The court's judgement enabled the state controlled minority owner ZCCM Investment Holdings to enter arbitration with the majority shareholder Vendanta Resources.

Vendanta agreed a financial settlement for all pollution claims, without admitting liability, in 2021.
