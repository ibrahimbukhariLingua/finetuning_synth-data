## History

On March 30, 2021, Xiaomi announced that would establish a wholly-owned subsidiary dedicated to the intelligent electric vehicle (EV) business. The initial investment for this venture was set at 10 billion Chinese yuan, with an expected total investment of 10 billion US dollars over the next 10 years. Lei Jun, the CEO of the group, would also serve as the CEO of the intelligent electric vehicle business. On September 1, 2021, Xiaomi Automobile Co., Ltd. was officially established.

On November 27, 2021, the Municipal Government of Beijing and Xiaomi officially signed a cooperation agreement, formally announcing Xiaomi Automobile's establishment in the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone. Xiaomi Automobile plans to build a two-phase vehicle factory with a cumulative annual production capacity of 300,000 vehicles. The production capacities for the first and second phases are 150,000 vehicles each. The first car is scheduled to roll off the production line in the Beijing Economic and Technological Development Zone in 2024, marking the commencement of mass production.

In March 2022, Xiaomi Group released its annual performance report for 2021. The report revealed that Xiaomi's intelligent electric vehicle business had progressed beyond expectations since announcing the car manufacturing plan in March 2021. As of December 2023, the research and development team for its automotive business has grown to exceed 1,000 people, and it is anticipated that formal mass production will commence in the first half of 2024.

On 28 December 2023, Xiaomi has unveiled its first electric car, the SU7. The SU7 was formally launched on 28 March 2024 in Beijing, with Xiaomi starting to take orders for the car on that day.

In July 2024, Xiaomi Auto gained independent car-making qualification from the Chinese government after previously using BAIC Motor's credentials.
