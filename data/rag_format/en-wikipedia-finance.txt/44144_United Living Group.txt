## History

United Living Group was formed by the merger of United House Ltd and Bullock Construction in September 2014 with the vision to become the national market leader in the provision of affordable housing and sustainable solutions.

The company known today was established in 2019 through a merger with Fastflow Group, a gas, water, and energy engineering firm. This merger combined the two company’s strengths in construction, utilities, and property maintenance, positioning United Living Group as a significant player in the construction and infrastructure sectors. Neil Armstrong, the CEO of Fastflow Group, was appointed as the CEO and chairman of the newly formed entity.

In 2021, United Living Group expanded its portfolio by acquiring Great British Communications, now operating as United Living Connected, a specialist in fixed-line and mobile telecommunications infrastructure.

In 2023, the Group secured a substantial investment from Apollo Global Management, one of the world's leading private equity firms.

In 2024, United Living Group continued its expansion by acquiring AFECO, a company specialising in engineering services and solutions for the water and marine sectors. The Group also enhanced its capabilities through the acquisition of GTEC, a leading training provider, aimed at addressing the skills gap in the construction industry and strengthening its workforce.
