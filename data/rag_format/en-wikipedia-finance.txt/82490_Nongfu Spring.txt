## History

The company was established on September 26, 1996. It launched its first packaged drinking water product in 1997 with water sourced from Zhejiang Thousand-Island Lake and became the joint stock company Nongfu Spring Co., Ltd in 2001.

As reported by Reuters, Nongfu Spring filed an initial public offering with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company raised approximately US$1 billion by pricing its IPO at the HKD 21.50 per share, at the top end of its IPO range.

It developed and launched a range of beverages, including Farmer's Orchard, Scream and Oriental Leaf and used marketing slogans, most notably ‘a little bit sweet’ to popular effect.

Through growth and acquisition, Nongfu Spring has become China's largest bottled water producer and a top three producer in the bottled tea and juice market.

According to Nielsen research data, Nongfu Springs natural water became in 2012 the most popular bottled water in China.

On April 10, 2013, the *Beijing Times* accused the company of intentionally not adopting Chinese national water standards and instead adopting the lower standards of Zhejiang province. This started a dispute between the company and the newspaper. In November 2013, the company accused the *Beijing Times* of defamation and filed a lawsuit in the Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court against the newspaper, demanding 60 million yuan (US$9.85 million) in damages.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
