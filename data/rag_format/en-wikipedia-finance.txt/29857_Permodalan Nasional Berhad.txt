**Permodalan Nasional Berhad** (**PNB**) is a state-owned Malaysian investment management company. One of the largest fund management companies in Malaysia, it was established on 17 March 1978 as one of the instruments of the government's New Economic Policy.

PNB's two notable projects are located in Kuala Lumpur. They are the megatall skyscraper Merdeka 118 on Jalan Hang Jebat, and the PNB 1194 Hotel (formerly MAS Building) on Jalan Sultan Ismail.
