# Osem (company)



**Osem Investments Ltd.** (Hebrew: אֹסֶם השקעות בע"מ) is one of the largest food manufacturers and distributors in Israel. The group is owned (100%) by Nestlé S.A. of Switzerland.

Before it was acquired by Nestlé, the company was publicly traded and listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. It was a constituent of the TA-35 Index.


## History

In 1942, Eugen Propper and his partner merged Hadagan with two other factories, Assisit and Itrit, to create Osem. The name's origin is in the prayer of the High Priest on Yom Kippur at the time of the Temple in Jerusalem on leaving the Holy of Holies.

In 1946, the company built its first factory in Bnei Brak, producing noodles. Seven years later, in 1953, upon a request by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, the company added its staple "rice-substitute" product ptitim. In 1964, Osem's snack factory was founded in Holon, and the company's main product was created - the peanut butter-flavoured Bamba. In 1970, the company started producing baked food in addition to introducing the Bissli snacks, which come in several flavours such as falafel, mesquite, BBQ, pizza, and onion. Osem also produces soup powders and markets MSG-free versions of its soup mixes under a green label as opposed to the traditional red one.

The company's main factory was built in 1976 in Petah Tikva, in which the company's administration offices, distribution centre, and the sauce factory are now found.

Osem has acquired several smaller food companies and expanded their product lines, such as Froumine, Argal Bakery Shop, and Magdanot HaBait factory (where the cakes production line is found).

Other products manufactured by Osem are Cheerios breakfast cereal and hummus.
