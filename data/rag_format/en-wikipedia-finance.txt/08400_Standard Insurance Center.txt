# Standard Insurance Center



The **Standard Insurance Center**, originally the **Georgia-Pacific Building**, is a 27-story office building in Portland, Oregon. Completed in 1970, it is part of the headquarters of The Standard, the brand name under which Standard Insurance Company and other subsidiaries of StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. do business. Standard also owns the 16-story Standard Plaza two blocks south along 5th Avenue.


## History

The Georgia-Pacific Building was commissioned by Georgia-Pacific and designed by the firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. At the time of construction, it was the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world. It was completed in 1970.


## Details

Standing 367 feet (112 m) tall, the building has 27 above-ground stories. Valued at $114 million, the structure contains 459,504 square feet (42,689.3 m²) of space. Built of concrete and steel, it is considered Modernist in style. One major tenant was the Stoel Rives law firm, which leased the top nine stories of the building until 2016. *The Quest*, an elaborate sculpture considered Portland’s largest single piece of white sculpted marble, is in front of the building. An untitled chrome sculpture is tucked away in the building's basement.
