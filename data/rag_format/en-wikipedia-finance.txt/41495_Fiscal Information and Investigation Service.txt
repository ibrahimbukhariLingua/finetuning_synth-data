# Fiscal Information and Investigation Service



The **Fiscal Information and Investigation Service** (Dutch: *Fiscale inlichtingen- en opsporingsdienst*, **FIOD**) is an agency of the government of the Netherlands responsible for investigating financial crimes. It is part of the Tax and Customs Administration, which itself falls under the responsibility of the Dutch Ministry of Finance.


## History

The FIOD-ECD was formed when the FIOD and the ECD (Dutch: *Economische Controledienst*) were merged in 1999.
In 2010, the name was changed to FIOD.


## Role

The FIOD's main roles are in investigation and governance. Investigations are mainly carried out into economic, fiscal and financial fraud. Governance is carried out in economic and financial areas.

Any one of the five main Dutch ministries (Economics, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Health, Welfare and Sports) can order the FIOD to act on information of suspected fraud. They are also the investigational unit for several financial watchdogs.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
