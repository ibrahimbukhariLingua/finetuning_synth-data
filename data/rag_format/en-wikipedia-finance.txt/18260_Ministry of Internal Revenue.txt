Ministry of Internal Revenue


# Ministry of Internal Revenue



The **Ministry of Internal Revenue** (Indonesian: *Kementerian Penerimaan Negara*, lit.â€‰'Ministry of State Revenue'), was a planned ministry in the Prabowo Cabinet tasked with collecting Indonesian taxes, customs, and excise and administering the Indonesian Internal Revenue Code (which currently regulated by Omnibus Law for Harmonization of Taxation Regulations, Law No. 7/2021). Prabowo Subianto announced the existence of this ministry on 25 September 2024. Prabowo asserted that this ministry would exist in his incoming administration.

This ministry resulted from a future spin-off of the Directorate General of Taxes and Directorate General of Customs and Excise. Once fully established, this ministry will be the Indonesian counterpart of the United States Internal Revenue Service.


## History

In December 2023, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, then vice-presidential candidate, voiced his intention to combine the Directorate General of Taxes and the Directorate General of Customs and Excise of the Ministry of Finance. He voiced his intention in the vice-presidency candidacy debate. In their campaign, Prabowo and Gibran confirmed that they would do so. According to Drajad Wibowo, a member of the Board of Experts of the Prabowo-Gibran campaign, this fusion intended to maximize state revenue through tax, customs, and excise.

It was confirmed that Prabowo will name the Minister of Internal Revenue on 20 September 2024. But, on the inauguration of the Red White Cabinet, it was not announced, and the plan to realize the ministry was quashed by Sri Mulyani.
