Nova Scotian pound


# Nova Scotian pound



The **pound** (sign: **£**) was the currency of Nova Scotia until 1860. It was subdivided into 20 *shillings* (sign: **s** or **/–**), each of 12 *pence* (sign: **d**). It was equivalent to sterling and was replaced by the *dollar* in 1860, at a rate of $5 = £1 ($1 = 4/–), although coins and notes of the dollar currency were not issued until 1861.


## Tokens

In addition to British coins, copper tokens were issued in 1823 and 1856 in denominations of ½d and 1d.


## Banknotes

In 1812, the Provincial Government introduced Treasury notes in denominations of £1, £2½, £5 and £50. Between 1813 and 1830, notes for £1, £2 and £5 were issued. 5/– and 10/– notes were added in 1830. Along with the Treasury notes, two chartered banks issued paper money in Nova Scotia, the *Bank of Nova Scotia*, and the *Halifax Banking Company*. The Halifax Banking Company issued notes from 1825, in denominations of £1½, £5, £6, £6½ and £7, whilst the Bank of Nova Scotia began issuing notes in 1834, with denominations of £1½, £2, £2½, £5¼, £6, £7, £7½ and £10.
