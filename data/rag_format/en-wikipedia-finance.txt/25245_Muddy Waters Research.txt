## Investments


### Report on Sino-Forest

Muddy Waters gained notability in 2011 following the release of a negative research report on Sino-Forest Corp, in which Muddy Waters alleged that the company was fraudulently inflating its assets and earnings hence, making the company's shares worthless. Muddy Waters declared that the Sino-Forest was a "multi-billion dollar ponzi scheme". As a result, shares of Sino-Forest fell by 82% following Muddy Waters report, forcing prominent investor John Paulson to sell his entire stake at a $US720 million loss. Sino-Forest dismissed Muddy Waters allegations of fraud and launched an independent investigation for PricewaterhouseCoopers to oversee. On March 30, 2012, Sino-Forest filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Shortly after German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority inquired the case suspecting overstepping of ethical and legal lines by Muddy Waters Capital.
