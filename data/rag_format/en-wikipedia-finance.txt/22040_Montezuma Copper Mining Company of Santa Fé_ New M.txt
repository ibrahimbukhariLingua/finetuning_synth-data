The **Montezuma Copper Mining Company of Santa Fé, New Mexico** was incorporated (1861) in the American Territory of New Mexico for the purpose of mining precious metals, industrial metals, and coal in the counties of Santa Ana, Santa Fé, San Miguel, and Rio Arriba.


## Corporate history

The Montezuma Copper Mining Company of Santa Fé, New Mexico was incorporated in the New Mexico Territorial Legislature on Jan 26, 1861, prior to the beginning of the American Civil War. Corporate members were: Oliver P. Hovey, Anastacio Sandoval, Hamilton G. Fant, Tomás Cabeza de Baca, Ceran St. Vrain, Nicolas Pino, A. P. Wilbar, Francisco Lopez, S. J. Spiegelberg, José Manuel Gallegos, H. B. Sweeny, Mateo Sandoval, Joseph Seligman, Felipe Delgado, Levi Spiegelberg, Francisco Montoya, Richard Jenkins, José Guadalupe Gallegos, Edward Wise, Andrés Sandoval, George C. Miller, Francisco Sandoval, M. Ashurst, Juan María Baca, Gabriel Rivera, William A. Street, José Pablo Gallegos, James Hubbell, Felix Garcia, James L. Collins, José Leandro Perea, John S. Watts, Faustin Baca y Ulibarri, Miguel Sena y Romero, and Sidney A. Hubbell. The initial capital stock value was $500,000.

The Spiegelberg brothers were also associated with the Willison Mining Company, as members of the board of directors, in 1872. It has been reported that Lehman Spiegelberg may have acquired the San Marcos Pueblo grant because of his interest in copper mining. It has been written that the Spiegelbergs were probably familiar with Indian agent William F. M. Arny's reports and newspaper articles on minerals in the area following his 1868 travels through Ute-controlled Tierra Amarilla, where he came into contact with mining parties. (Arny also served as Territorial secretary under governor Henry Connelly, for whom he served as acting governor for about half a year between 1862-3, during Connelly's illness.) Indian agents served as active promoters for mining development in New Mexico.

In 1863 Richard Jenkins, chief engineer of the operation, published the *Report of the Montezuma Copper Mining Company of Santa Fe, New Mexico*.
Gilbert E. Currie listed the operation as follows in 1864: Capital $1,500,000. President: Ephraim Marsh; Vice President, B. G. Clarke; Secretary and Treasurer, David S. Dodge; Chief Engineer, Richard Jenkins; Directors, Ephraim Marsh, Benjamin G. Clark, Jos. H. Scranton, John T. Flanagan, Charles W. Keiser, Th. Dickson, Selden F. Scranton.
