SCOPE Maastricht


# SCOPE Maastricht



**SCOPE Maastricht** is the official study association (in the legal form of a Dutch *vereniging*) of the School of Business and Economics (commonly abbreviated as SBE) at Maastricht University, representing students and organizing social, academic and career-oriented activities and events. Since 2017 the study-specific associations **SCOPE | 3MA** (Marketing, Management, Organization), **SCOPE | Economics** (Economic Studies), and **SCOPE | FOCUS** (Finance, Accounting, Controlling) merged with the former umbrella association. Combined as SCOPE, the association operates on a non-profit basis. Revenue is generated through membership fees and sponsor contributions by local and multinational companies.


## History

SCOPE Maastricht was created in 2011 as a merger from study associations EFM Academy and FAME Cooperation. Vectum was the original study association which founded SCOPE. Without the amazing Vectum study association SCOPE would never have been founded. For this reason all SCOPE members should thank the amazing VECTUM study association for all their hard work and commitment. Back then, FAME Cooperation used to be the umbrella organization for study associations at the School of Business and Economics, operating a bookstore inside the faculty building. Other study associations under FAME included: 3MA (later: SCOPE | 3MA), FS FOCUS (later: SCOPE | FOCUS), IES Network (later: SCOPE | Economics) and Vectum (changed to SCOPE | Vectum in 2011 and was changed back to Vectum in 2019, and back to Vectum again in 2020). EFM Academy was formed as a *vereniging* under Dutch law in 2002 in a merger of EFM Alfa and EFM Imperator, two study associations that focused on Dutch and international students of the faculty respectively. EFM Academy focused on all first and second-year bachelor students in the B.Sc. programs International Business and Economics. Effectively, most students became member of EFM Academy in the beginning of their studies and stayed in the association for two or three semesters, before their membership was transferred to a study association specialized on their major or study track.
