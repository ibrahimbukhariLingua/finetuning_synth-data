## History

The business was launched as The Medical Property Investment Fund in 2003 and became listed on the London Stock Exchange in that year. The name was changed to Assura Group in 2006. In 2008 the company bought new premises for expansion in Halton. Assura sold its Assura Medical division to Virgin Group in 2010, which rebranded it as Virgin Care.

It acquired AH Medical, another primary healthcare business, in 2011. It named Graham Roberts, a former finance director of British Land Company, as Chief Executive in March 2012. In June 2012 it decided to convert to Real Estate Investment Trust ('REIT') status.

In July 2016, the firm announced that Roberts had died of cancer. Financial Director Jonathan Murphy became interim CEO and was confirmed in the position permanently in February 2017.

At the beginning of 2021 the business acquired Apollo Capital Projects, increasing its pipeline by an initial eight schemes and expanding the company's offering to the NHS.

In February 2025, Assura's board rejected KKR’s fourth acquisition offer, which valued the British healthcare landlord at £1.56 billion. KKR’s bid of 48 pence per share represented a 28% premium on Assura’s 13 February 2025 closing price but was 2.8% below its net asset value. Despite previous rejections, KKR was undecided on making a firm offer before the 14 March 2025 deadline.
