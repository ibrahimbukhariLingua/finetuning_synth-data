## History

The committee was established to oversee the nation's banking sector, currency regulation, and financial policies. Its creation is rooted in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which empowers the National Assembly to form committees necessary for the effective execution of its legislative responsibilities. Specifically, Section 62(1) of the Constitution states:

The National Assembly established the committee's jurisdiction to address the growing complexity of Nigeria's financial system and provide specialized legislative oversight. It plays a major role in shaping financial legislation and ensuring the stability and accountability of Nigeria's financial institutions. Over the years, the committee has contributed to formulating and amending key laws, such as the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA), which governs banking operations in Nigeria.

Its functions align with constitutional provisions and the broader mandate of the National Assembly to safeguard the nation's economic framework. Under successive legislative sessions, the committee has held public hearings, engaged with financial regulators like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and addressed critical issues affecting the financial sector, such as excessive bank charges and currency management.
