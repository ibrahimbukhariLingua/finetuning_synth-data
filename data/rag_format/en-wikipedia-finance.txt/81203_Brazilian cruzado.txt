Brazilian cruzado


# Brazilian cruzado



The **cruzado** was the currency of Brazil from 1986 to 1989. It replaced the second cruzeiro (at first called the "cruzeiro novo") in 1986, at a rate of 1 cruzado = 1000 cruzeiros (novos) and was replaced in 1989 by the cruzado novo at a rate of 1000 cruzados = 1 cruzado novo.

This currency was subdivided in 100 centavos and it had the symbol {\displaystyle \mathrm {CzS} \!\!\!\Vert } and the ISO 4217 code *BRC*.
