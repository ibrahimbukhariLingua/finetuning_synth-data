TT Games


# TT Games



**TT Games Limited** is a British holding company and a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Games. The company was established in 2005 through the merger of developer Traveller's Tales and publisher Giant Interactive (now TT Games Publishing). Its other branches include developer TT Fusion, animation studio TT Animation and mobile game studio TT Odyssey. The company is best known for its video games based on the Lego construction toy.


## History

In 2003, The Lego Group's video game division, Lego Interactive, commenced plans to develop *Lego Star Wars: The Video Game*, based on the company's licensed Lego Star Wars toy sets. They contracted Traveller's Tales to develop the game, though Lego soon stepped out of the video game industry. Tom Stone and Jonathan Smith of Lego Interactive's senior management formed Giant Interactive, gaining the exclusive licence for Lego video games. As work progressed, Traveller's Tales manager Jon Burton recognised the potential of the game and the Lego licence, and how effectively the two companies worked together. *Lego Star Wars* was released in 2005 to positive reviews and strong sales, wherefore Traveller's Tales acquired Giant Interactive in April, forming TT Games.

TT Games continued to produce Lego games to considerable success; *Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy* received several awards and nominations in 2006, including the Best Gameplay Award at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts' 3rd British Academy Games Awards. In 2007, under advice from Farleys Solicitors, TT Games acquired developer Embryonic Studios and motion capture studio Centroid, which became TT Fusion and TT Centroid, respectively. On 8 November 2007, TT Games was bought by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and became part of its video game division, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now Warner Bros. Games). For Burton's share, which amounted to an ownership of 80% in TT Games, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment paid roughly £100 million (US$210 million).

TT Games expanded into mobile games with the acquisition of Playdemic in February 2017 and the opening of TT Odyssey (originally named TT Games Brighton) in January 2018.

On 20 January 2022, a report published by Polygon detailed the amount of crunch that occurred at TT Games during the development of *Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga*, including dozens inside the company being at odds with management, due to expressing frustration over tight development schedules, the company's crunch culture, and outdated development tools. In addition, the use of NTT (a new in-house engine that was being developed to replace TT's previous engine in attempt to avoid paying royalties for using a third-party engine like Unreal Engine or Unity) was extremely controversial within the company, as many employees had been pushing to instead use Unreal Engine. NTT turned out to be incredibly difficult to use, with some animations taking hours more to produce than they would on the old engine. As a result, *The Skywalker Saga* would end up being the only game developed by TT Games to use NTT, with the company deciding to use Unreal Engine going forward for their future projects. Follow-up reporting by Fanbyte revealed that management was dismissive of *Polygon*'s investigation and attempted to bury it by releasing a trailer for the game on the same day. They also report that Director of Game Development Eric Matthews and Head of Game Mark Green, who had been identified as nepotistic hires, were a continuing source of conflict and miscommunication from management.
