**Admerasia** is an American advertising company based in New York City. The company is known for its marketing of products from American companies to Asian American consumers.


## History

Admerasia was founded in 1993 by Zan Ng, a commercial photographer. He began the company with a personal investment of $250,000 that he and his brothers had saved up. In 1994, advertising executive Joseph Liu joined the company as a partner. Liu previously owned his own advertising company but joined Admerasia as he no longer wanted to deal with the risks associated with entrepreneurship. Both Ng and Liu came to the United States in 1975 in hopes of finding work as artists, Ng without any possessions and Liu with only a rice cooker.
