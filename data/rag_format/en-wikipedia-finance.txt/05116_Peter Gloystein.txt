## Qualifications, profession, family

Gloystein was born in 1945 in Bremen, Germany. After leaving school he studied Business Management at the University of Hamburg achieving his PhD in 1977 with a thesis titled "The promotion of industrial restructuring by funding instruments of the European Community", which was later published as a book entitled "Financing of industrial restructuring through the EC".

From 1971 to 1975 he worked as scientific lecturer at the HWWA-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung in Hamburg. Following this he moved on to investment banking at the WestLB in Düsseldorf (1975–1981). Gloystein then went on to work at the Commerzbank AG where he remained until 1999. First he was in charge of finance planning in the central department for Coordination and Planning in Frankfurt. In 1986 he moved on to be Head of the Stuttgart Branch. In 1990 he became deputy member of the board and one year later member of the board of the Commerzbank AG. In 1999 Gloystein moved on to become member of the board of the BHF-Bank and at the same time member of the Executive Committee Europe of the ING Group, Amsterdam. He became speaker of the board (CEO) of the BHF-Bank in 2000 in charge of controlling, credit-risk management, law, auditing and corporate communication. Gloystein resigned from the BHF and ING in 2002 as a result of differing opinions on future business strategy in the German market.

At the end of the 1990s, Gloystein was member of the board of the European Banking Association and the German Member of the Maas-Commission, which was formed by the European Commission for the technical preparation of the European Monetary Union.

In August 2004 the CDU nominated him as successor to Harmut Perschau, who had to resign due to health problems, and on 8 September 2004 he was voted in as the lord mayor and Senator for Economics and Harbours, as well as Senator for Culture in Bremen.

Gloystein is widowed with two children.


## Controversy

In Bremen Wine Week, on 12 May 2005, he poured a magnum of sparkling wine over a homeless man who was standing near the podium from which Mr Gloystein was speaking. Gloystein was described as laughing in the face of the crowd's boos and hisses. The homeless man burst into tears. Mr Gloystein later on offered compensation which was declined by the homeless man, responding that he is not going to be bribed. Mr Gloystein said that he had, in fact, intended to pour the wine into the man's mouth, but that he had turned away.

Mr Gloystein apparently later met the homeless man again and they parted "on friendly terms". Police confirmed that the homeless man was pressing charges against Gloystein for the incident. Mr Gloystein later resigned over the incident, following pressure from the media and opposition parties.
