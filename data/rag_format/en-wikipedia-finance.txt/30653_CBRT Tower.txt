# CBRT Tower



The **CBRT Tower** (abbreviated from **C**entral **B**ank of the **R**epublic of **T**urkey) also known as the **TCMB Tower** (Turkish: *Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası Kulesi*) is a supertall skyscraper under construction in the Finanskent district of Istanbul, Turkey. Started in 2020, the tower is scheduled for completion in 2024 and stands at 352 m (1,155 ft) with 59 floors. It is currently the tallest building in Istanbul and the tallest in Turkey, as well as the country's first-ever built supertall skyscraper.


## History

The tower is located in the Finanskent district of Istanbul and is part of the Istanbul Financial Center development, establishment which comprises several components designed to accommodate diverse financial activities and services. The concept of the Istanbul Financial Center emerged in the early 2000s as part of Turkey's broader economic vision to elevate its status in the global financial arena. The project gained momentum with the formal announcement by the Turkish government in 2009, signaling its commitment to transforming Istanbul into a significant financial hub. Subsequent legislative measures and substantial investments were made to advance the project.


### Architecture

The design of TCMB Tower, which belongs to and houses the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT), was created by Vizzion Architecture's Şefik Birkiye. The tower, which embodies both local tradition and modernity, mirrors the prestigious image of the CBR. It is the tallest building in both Istanbul and Turkey, boasting a construction area of around 300,000 m² (3,230,000 sq ft) and standing at 60 storeys tall. The lower levels contain a conference hall, museum, library, restaurant, sports fields, and winter gardens. The levels of the tower are designated for office spaces and meeting rooms.

The Central Cank tower was created by Şefik Birkiye from Vizzion Architecture. Constructing the building at such a height presented unique technical obstacles, requiring it to be earthquake-resistant. An innovative solution was necessary since the façade was designed with natural stone cladding to exude sophistication and strength. The issue was the heavy weight of the stone at high altitudes, and the answer was provided by the Turkish firm Silkar Stone.

Contract negotiations for the Istanbul Financial Center TCMB Phase 1 (Shell and Core) Construction Project were finalized on January 13, 2021 between Çuhadaroğlu Alüminyum Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. and Limak İnşaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş., as Çuhadaroğlu was selected to provide a custom design panel system for the project's 69,690 m² (750,000 sq ft) curtain wall façade, enabling the building to become Turkey's tallest at a minimum height of 320 meters.
