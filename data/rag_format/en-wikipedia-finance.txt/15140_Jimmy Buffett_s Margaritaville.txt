Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville


# Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville



**Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville** is a United States–based hospitality company that manages and franchises a casual dining American restaurant chain, retail stores selling Jimmy Buffett-themed merchandise, and hotels.

The Brand is named after Buffett's hit song "Margaritaville" and is owned by **Margaritaville Holdings LLC** (a subsidiary of **Cheeseburger Holding Company, LLC**). There are locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, six island locations throughout the Caribbean as well as in Sydney, Australia, since September 2012.

Some locations are franchise-owned, such as the Caribbean, Australian, and Mexican locations. In 2014, a Brazilian company bought 12 Margaritaville restaurants and the rights to expand the company in the U.S.


## History

The earliest business venture named Margaritaville that was associated with singer Jimmy Buffett was the nightclub JB's Margaritaville, which opened in Gulf Shores, Alabama in 1984. While not officially affiliated with Buffett, the nightclub was owned by a friend of his. He agreed to perform at the nightclub once a year for the next three years. On January 3, 1985, Buffett opened his first Margaritaville retail store at Lands End Village in Key West, Florida. Initially a souvenir store featuring Buffett-themed merchandise, Margaritaville was co-owned by Buffett and local businessperson Sunshine Smith. By May 1986, the store had become an eatery. In 2002, he expanded his business ventures by partnering with Outback Steakhouse to develop the first Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant in Southport, Indiana.

In late 2006, Buffett announced on the website that the Margaritaville cafes would no longer purchase or serve Canadian seafood products to protest Canada's treatment of seals.

On May 15, 2007, Harrah's Entertainment, now Caesars Entertainment Corp. announced plans to build the $700 million Margaritaville Casino Resort in Biloxi, Mississippi on the site of the former Grand Casino Biloxi and Casino Magic Biloxi properties. Due to the U.S. recession, however, construction of the casino ceased on June 10, 2008.

On January 12, 2011, following the announcement of the new partnership between MVB Holdings and the Brosig, Sekul, and Sims families, for the differently planned Biloxi, Mississippi, casino, John Payne, Caesars Entertainment Corp. central division president, stated, "We are disappointed that our project with Margaritaville will not proceed." This casino eventually opened in May 2012, then closed a few years later in September 2014.ʷʰᵉⁿ? A Margaritaville resort opened on Highway 90 at the location of the old Grand Casino.ʷʰᵉⁿ? This new resort does not have a casino.
