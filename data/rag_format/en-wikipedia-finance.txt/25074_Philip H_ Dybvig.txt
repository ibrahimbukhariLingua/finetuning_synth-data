He has been editor or associate editor of multiple journals, including the *Journal of Economic Theory*, *Finance and Stochastics*, *Journal of Finance*, *Journal of Financial Intermediation*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, and *Review of Financial Studies*.

Dybvig is known for his work with Douglas Diamond on the Diamond–Dybvig model of bank runs.

Dybvig was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Diamond and Ben Bernanke, "for research on banks and financial crises". Dybvig and Diamond wrote “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity” in 1983, in which they first introduced their mathematical model describing the vulnerability of banks during financial crises.


## Alleged sexual misconduct

In October 2022, Dybvig was accused of sexual harassment by several Chinese women attending Washington University’s Olin School of Business, where Dybvig works as a professor. He is on absentee leave until July 2023. Dybvig's lawyer has denied the allegations. Bloomberg News reported that he was said to have called one of the students "tián mèizi" (甜妹子), meaning "sweet young girl" and gave her gifts of chocolate. The encounters allegedly led the Chinese female students to warn each other about him.
