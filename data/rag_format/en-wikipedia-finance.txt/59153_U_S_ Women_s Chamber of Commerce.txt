## History

In 2005, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce won a lawsuit against the U.S. Small Business Administration for failure to implement a law passed in 2000 to provide a targeted set-aside program for women-owned businesses seeking federal contracts. This set-aside was established to help end the disparity in contracting faced by women.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Even though women own nearly 30 percent of all businesses in the United States, in 2007 they received only 3.41% of federal contracts.

In 2007, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce filed an amicus brief in support of the women's class action suit against Walmart.

In 2008, Margot Dorfman, CEO of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce, provided testimony before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pension in support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Her testimony was cited by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) as follows:

> As the executive director of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce recently noted, "The Fair Pay Restoration Act rewards those who play fair—including women business owners—unlike the Supreme Court's decision, which seems to give an unfair advantage to those who skirt the rules." This legislation will encourage all corporations to treat their employees fairly.

Leaders and members of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce are regularly called upon to testify before Congress on small business and economic issues.

On June 30, 2011, the Small Business Administration accepted the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce as an approved Third Party Certifier for the Women-Owned Small Business Contracting Program. To further opportunities for women-owned small business federal contractors, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce established the WOSB National Council.

In 2014, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce established the I Vote for Women.org website to support the election of candidates supporting the chamber's women's economic priorities.

On September 11, 2014, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce filed an amici curiae in support of Peggy Young for her case before the Supreme Court, *Young v. UPS No. 12-1226*, detailing the economic impact of women in the workforce.

On December 3, 2015, the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce announced their first ever presidential endorsement as they endorsed Secretary Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. Presidential race.
