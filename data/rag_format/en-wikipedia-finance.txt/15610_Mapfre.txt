# Mapfre



**Mapfre, S.A.** (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈmafɾe], officially typeset **MAPFRE**) is a Spanish multinational insurance company, based in Majadahonda, Madrid. The name comes from the old mutual origin of the company (*Mutualidad de la Agrupación de Propietarios de Fincas Rústicas de España*), but the company now only refers to itself as Mapfre. It is the leading insurance company in Spain and the largest non-life insurance company in Latin America.

The company purchased Webster, Massachusetts–based Commerce Insurance Group, a major provider of vehicle insurance, for over €1.5 billion in October 2007. Mapfre was listed in the Fortune Global 500 list on its 2008 edition. Rafael Nadal is officially sponsored by the company.

In October 2010, Mapfre acquired British travel insurance provider InsureandGo for an undisclosed sum. The company was sold again in 2021.

In March 2012, Antonio Huertas took over as Mapfre's chairman from José Manuel Martínez, who had held the role since 2001.

### Hurricane Maria

Three lawsuits filed in the Virgin Islands allege MAPFRE may be in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Amber Stein filed the most recent suit 30 August.ʸᵉᵃʳᵐⁱˢˢⁱⁿᵍᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

"While MAPFRE is certainly inept, its refusal to hire enough qualified adjustors is also ... by design and part of a pattern and practice intended to avoid" its legal obligations and "part of a pattern and practice of bad faith and deceit," Stein's attorneys wrote in the complaint. Like Sheesley, Stein alleges MAPFRE offered pennies on the dollar. Stein had a contractor's estimate for more than $140,000 for repairs but MAPFRE offered $10,718.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

To back up the allegation that these delays are part of a larger strategy, Stein and other recent suits point to the fact that Puerto Rico fined MAPFRE for similar delays in paying claims for hurricane damage there. In February 2018, the Puerto Rico Insurance Commissioner's Office fined seven companies a total of $2.4 million for delays that violated Puerto Rico law. MAPFRE PRAICO, the defendant in all of the V.I. cases, was fined $714,000 – the largest single fine. MAPFRE Pan American Insurance Company was separately fined $359,100.

Capital Crossing Servicing has filed a lawsuit against Mapfre Praico Insurance Company claiming the insurer has only paid $2.6mn of $39.6mn total submitted claims related to Hurricane Maria.
