## Environmental commitment

Compared to other steel plants the Qatar Steel's most significant advantage is that its production is based on DRI which uses clean raw material. It employs various methods of recycling and re-using production waste, basing its production process on the utilization of clean raw materials and, steel making technology that is the lowest producer of CO₂ emission per ton.

* Environment Management Program
 Under an Environment Management Program, the company's most significant environmental contribution is centered on diffusing dust emissions, which to a large degree are the results of technology utilized in the 1970s. The revamping of the dust collection system in the existing facilities is within the scope of these projects.
 As a part of waste management, Qatar Steel continues to study various options to re-using / re-cycling its production waste. Palletizing DR product dust and EF dust, recycling of Refractory bricks and extracting iron from slag are some of the programs under progress. The utilization of used tyres as a carbon source in the steel melting process is an achievement in the right direction. This project may be able to contribute to solving or reducing a major community waste problem.
* ISO 14001:2004
 The company migrates to the new environmental ISO 14001:2004 standard as another move towards these globally accepted environment standards. The alignment of environmental objectives, targets and programs with the corporate HSE objective were considered significant achievements during this transition.

## Facilities in Dubai

Qatar Steel Company FZE was established in August 2003 to produce steel wire-rod products.

The company operates two primary facilities at its 60,000 Sq. meter Jebel Ali Free Zone site. The facilities have a yearly production capacity of 280,000 tonnes of wire rods and 300,000 tons of bars.
