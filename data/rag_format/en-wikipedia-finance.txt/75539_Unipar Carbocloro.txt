# Unipar Carbocloro



**Unipar Carbocloro** is a publicly traded Brazilian chemical company based in São Paulo and chaired by Frank Geyer Abubakir.


## History

Founded in 1969 as União Participações Industriais Ltda., the company is the owner of an industrial complex for the production of chemicals, polyolefins and other oil derivatives, and was a pioneer in the installation of petrochemical complex of São Paulo.

After a consolidation process in the 1980s and 1990s, the company changed its name to Unipar - União de Indústrias Petroquímicas S/A and began a period of expansion from the early 2000s with the incorporation of new company Rio Polímeros and capacity increases at Petroquímica União and Polietilenos União subsidiaries.

In 2008 the company consolidated its assets in southeastern Brazil in the Quattor Participações holding and in 2010 the company was sold to Braskem and Petrobras. Thus, Braskem became the largest petrochemical company in Latin America.

Unipar maintained its investment in other businesses and in 2013 acquired the remaining shares of Carbocloro company from the Occidental Petroleum Corporation. The result was the creation of Unipar Carbocloro S/A, a publicly traded company that used to have minority shareholding capital of Tecsis Technology (but no longer own it) and Advanced Systems S/A. In its current shareholder structure, Unipar Carbocloro exists since May 2013 when the deal was approved by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE).
