Their public programs include forums and conferences, economic education outreach, tours and a speakersâ€™ bureau.


## History

Established on December 1, 1927, the Charlotte Branch was located on the 20th floor of the First National Bank Building. It was setup to primarily serve the industrial Piedmont region of North and South Carolina; in its first full year of operation in 1928, the Charlotte Branch handled nearly 6.6 million checks worth almost $1.7 billion and received and shipped over $40 million in currency. On January 20, 1942, the Charlotte Branch relocated into a new three-story, ancient-style (a blending of Art Moderne, Art Deco, and Neoclassical architecture) building located at 401 South Tryon Street. In 1955-56, two stories were added to the building, as well as a rectangular rear extension. By 1970, the Charlotte Branch acquired an adjacent building and added a second-story enclosed walkway to link the buildings together.

In 1985, the Charlotte Branch moved to its third and current location at 530 East Trade Street. The five-story, modernist building, includes a three-story underground vault encased in steel used for currency storage and exchange. In 2009, check-processing operations at the Charlotte Branch were discontinued as the system was transferred to electronic check-clearing; leaving only currency storage, exchange, and shredding operations.
