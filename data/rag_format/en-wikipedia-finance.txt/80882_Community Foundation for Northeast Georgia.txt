## History

The Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia was founded to receive and disburse charitable funds for an improved quality of life throughout Gwinnett County.

After a capital campaign provided the initial seed money, the foundation received a major boost in 1987, due to the efforts of the late Robert D. Fowler. Under his leadership, he and the other owners of the Gwinnett Daily News offered a $1 million challenge grant, which was matched by the community. The board of directors voted to change the name to the Community Foundation for Northeast Georgia in March 2002, formally recognizing the regional growth from Gwinnett and the surrounding 3 counties of Barrow, North Fulton and Forsyth to the Northeast Georgia Counties of Clarke, Jackson, Madison, Greene, Oconee and Walton. .
