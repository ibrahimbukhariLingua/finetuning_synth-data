**Nomad** is a company that sells eSIMs (embedded SIMs), launched in 2020.


## History

Nomad was launched in 2020 and is a business line of LotusFlare, Inc., a telecommunications software development company founded by former Facebook andÂ Microsoft engineers.

Nomad is a connectivity marketplace that offers mobile data plans worldwide supplied by various communications service providers. International travelers with eSIM-capable smartphones can buy data plans from local providers, reducing roaming costs. eSIMs can be purchased through the website or the smartphone app.

Plans include global eSIMs covering most countries and regional plans for specific areas such as Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Oceania. These plans cater to both short-term trips and extended stays.

It is a data-only service, meaning it doesn't support traditional cellular voice calls or SMS messaging, but the speeds are fast enough to handle voice and video chat via apps like FaceTime or WhatsApp.

In 2024, Nomad also launched Nomad eSIM Enterprise for business travelers.

Nomad has been featured in articles by The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and CNBC.
