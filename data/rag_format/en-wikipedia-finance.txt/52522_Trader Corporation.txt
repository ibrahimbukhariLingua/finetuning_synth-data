## History

AutoTrader (Trader Corporation) was founded in 1975 in Etobicoke, Ontario. The company was known for its *AutoTrader* magazine, which was published under different names depending on the geographic region. In 1987, AutoTrader was acquired by John MacBain, founder, president, and CEO of Trader Classified Media. Trader Classified Media included over 500 print titles and 57 internet sites in 20 countries. Trader Classified Media went public in 2000 and was publicly traded on NASDAQ and the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange.

Trader Corporation was formed in June 2006 with the integration of Classified Media (Canada) Holdings Inc. (more commonly known as Trader Canada) and Trader Media Corporation. The two companies were acquired by Yellow Pages Income Fund from Trader Classified Media that same year. Yellow Pages purchased Classified Media (Canada) Holdings Inc. for $760 million and Trader Media Corporation for $436 million.

In July 2010, Trader Corporation acquired CanadianDriver.com, which offered Canada-focused automotive reviews and resources. The site was rebranded as Autos.ca.

Yellow Pages sold its Trader Corporation division in March 2011 to London-based private equity firm Apax Partners for $745 million. Apax Partners previously purchased a 49.9% stake in U.K.-based Trader Media Group in 2007, and acquired the remaining 50.1% in 2014.

In June 2012, Trader Corporation stopped publishing the AutoTrader magazine and several of its other magazines and pushed a move towards online car advertising.

In 2016, Apax sold Trader Corporation to Thoma Bravo for C$1.57 billion (US$1.22 billion). In the same year, editorial content was moved to the AutoTrader.ca domain; Autos.ca has been put into maintenance mode.

Since 2017, the company has awarded the best cars in each segment in Canada.

In January 2020, Trader Corporation invested in Motoinsight, a provider of digital retailing solutions for the automotive industry. In May 2020, AutoTrader.ca added online transaction capabilities and allowed Canadian users to purchase cars on the website.

In June 2021, Trader Corporation invested in Activix, a software development firm that serves automobile dealerships.
