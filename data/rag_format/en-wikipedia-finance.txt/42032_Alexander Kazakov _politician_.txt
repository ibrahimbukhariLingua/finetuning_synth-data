## Biography

Under the Soviet Union, Kazakov worked in Gosplan, the economic planning agency of the USSR, until 1992. During his service in the Russian government, Kazakov was deputy chairman of the property commission under Anatoly Chubais in 1993–1994 before becoming part of President Boris Yeltsin's administration as the head of the department working with regional bureaucracies. In January 1996, President Yeltsin appointed Kazakov to the post of chairman of the State Property Committee and also one of the Deputy Chairmen of Government of the Russian Federation.
