Coupon Mountain


# Coupon Mountain



**Coupon Mountain** was an e-commerce website operated based in Monrovia, California, that displayed syndicated online deals. Founded in 2001 by Harry Tsao and Talmadge O'Neill, Coupon Mountain began as one of the two original website properties for MeziMedia, which was acquired by ValueClick for up to $352 million. MeziMedia was renamed to ValueClick Brands in 2010. In November 2013, ValueClick sold several of its online properties to IAC which, in addition to Coupon Mountain, included price-comparison website PriceRunner and investment education site Investopedia for $80 million. Coupon Mountain, along with PriceRunner, were being actively shopped in 2016 after slumping sales attributed to a change in Google's search algorithm but only PriceRunner was sold in March 2016 to Swedish firm NS Intressenter for around $100 million. That got fully acquired by Klarna in 2022.

At its peak in 2008, Coupon Mountain held 14% of the total market-share for coupon websites and has been offline since October 2014.
