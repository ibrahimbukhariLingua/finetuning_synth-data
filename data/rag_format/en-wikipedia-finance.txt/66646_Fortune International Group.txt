# Fortune International Group



**Fortune International Group** is a real estate development, sales and marketing, and brokerage firm based in Miami, Florida.


## Overview

The company was founded in 1983 by Edgardo Defortuna. The company operates across 20 office locations, employing over 1,000 multilingual local real estate professionals.

Throughout its history, Fortune has developed over 30 residential towers and marketed and sold over 120, representing 31,000 residential units. The company has also developed 8 million square feet of real estate and maintains a global network of over 100,000 luxury real estate professionals.


## History

Edgardo Defortuna moved to Miami from Argentina in 1983 to pursue a master's degree in business at the University of Miami. During his studies, he observed an influx of Latin American buyers investing in Miami real estate and identified a gap in the market to address the specific needs of these buyers. He began assisting these investors with property management, which eventually evolved into a brokerage called Fortune International Realty, focused on international buyers.

In the early 1990s, Fortune Development Sales was formed to serve developers of residential condominium projects by providing on-site sales representation. By 1998, Edgardo and his team create a proprietary new development platform to develop their own properties. As the business grew, additional entities were formed to expand the company’s offerings. Recognizing the need to consolidate these operations under a unified brand, Edgardo established Fortune International Group as the umbrella organization.

The first development that Fortune International Group got involved with was Grandview in North Bay Village. After Grandview, Fortune International Group developed Jade Residences at Brickell Bay in the early 2000s, the first property to be developed by the company from the ground up. This project was a 50-story tower that introduced smart home technology to Miami's residential market. This project marked the start of the Jade series of developments.

Subsequent projects included Jade Beach (2008), Jade Ocean (2009), and Jade Signature (2018) in Sunny Isles Beach, the latter in collaboration with the architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and interior designer Pierre-Yves Rochon. Since then, the company has expanded its portfolio with projects in Brickell, Key Biscayne, Coral Gables, Aventura, Miami Beach, Sunny Isles Beach and Pompano Beach.

In 2022, Fortune International Group formed a partnership with Christie’s International Real Estate, becoming the affiliate in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. The partnership provides Fortune and its agents access to state-of-the-art technology and marketing platforms, as well as training resources.
