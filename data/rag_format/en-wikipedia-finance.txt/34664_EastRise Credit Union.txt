## Direct Financial

In 2014, New England Federal Credit Union acquired HealthOne Credit Union based in Detroit, Michigan. HealthOne had been placed into conservatorship by the State of Michigan in May 2014.

EastRise operations in Michigan and Ohio were subsequently run under the Direct Financial branding.


## Acquisition of Vermont State Employees' Credit Union

In 2022, members of the Vermont State Employees' Credit Union, then the second largest credit union in Vermont, narrowly voted to join EastRise. The combined organization became one of the largest credit unions in the United States with nearly $3 billion in assets and twenty-three locations.


## 2024 Rebrand

On September 19, 2024, the credit union officially became EastRise Credit Union. The rebrand fulfilled a promise to former VSECU members during the merger campaign in 2022. The credit union adopted a new name, color palette, and logo.


## Charitable activities

EastRise sponsors RightTrack, a financial literacy program for high school students. EastRise hosts "Shred Fests" where members of the general public may bring documents to be shredded by a professional shredding company. In 2008, over 13 tons of documents were destroyed. EastRise also annually awards six $3,000 college scholarships to members pursuing degrees in nursing and science.
