Comptroller


# Comptroller



A **comptroller** (pronounced either the same as *controller* or as /kəmpˈtroʊlər/) is a management-level position responsible for supervising the quality of accounting and financial reporting of an organization. A financial comptroller is a senior-level executive who acts as the head of accounting, and oversees the preparation of financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements.

In most Commonwealth countries, the comptroller general, auditor general, or comptroller and auditor general is the external auditor of the budget execution of the government and of government-owned companies. Typically, the independent institution headed by the comptroller general is a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. In American government, the comptroller is effectively the chief financial officer of a public body.

In business management, the comptroller is closer to a chief audit executive, holding a senior role in internal audit functions. Generally, the title encompasses a variety of responsibilities, from overseeing accounting and monitoring internal controls to countersigning on expenses and commitments.


## Etymology

The word is a variant of "controller". The "cont-" or "count-" part in that word was associated with "compt-", a variant of the verb "count". The term, though criticized by lexicographers such as Henry Watson Fowler, is probably retained in part because in official titles it was deemed useful to have the title dissociated from the word and concept "control".

A variant explanation is that *comptroller* evolved in the 15th century through a blend of the French *compte* ("an account") and the Middle English *countreroller* (someone who checks a copy of a scroll, from the French *contreroule* "counter-roll, scroll copy"), thus creating a title for a *compteroller* who specializes in checking financial ledgers. This etymology explains why the name is often pronounced identically to "controller" despite the distinct spelling. However, *comptroller* is sometimes pronounced phonetically by those unaware of the word's origins or who wish specifically to avoid confusion with "controller".


## Business role

In business, the comptroller is the person who, independently from the chief financial officer in some countries, oversees accounting, and the implementation and monitoring of internal controls. In countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Canada, a comptroller or financial comptroller reports to the CFO in companies that have one.

Businesses typically use the spelling *controller*, while government organizations use *comptroller*.
