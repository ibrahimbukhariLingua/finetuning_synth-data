# The Office Group



**The Office Group** **(TOG)** is a shared office space operator, with over 70 locations totalling 3.1 million sq ft across London, Cambridge, Oxford, Reading, Bristol, Leeds, Berlin, Frankfurt, and Hamburg. The buildings are operated through the Fora brand, which offers a mix of private offices that house from one person up to 2,000 with coworking memberships, relaxed lounge spaces, meeting rooms and event space hire.


## Workspace locations

The Office Group currently has 62 buildings located in London, Bristol and Leeds, including iconic addresses at One Canada Square, The Shard and the Gridiron Building in Kings Cross, with several buildings in the development, including Chancery House and five in Germany – TOG’s first expansion outside of the UK. Sustainable design is a core principle of TOG developments, with buildings integrating high level energy efficiency programmes, renewable energy, rainwater harvesting, and a focus on natural light and green spaces.


## TOG workspaces and services

TOG offers a variety of workspaces: including private offices, closed door coworking areas, lounge space and meeting rooms.


## Management and ownership

TOG was founded in 2004 by co-CEOs Olly Olsen and Charlie Green, launching with a building on City Road. In September 2010, when TOG had seven buildings in its portfolio, Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman funded the management buyout of the previous private equity shareholders to become the majority shareholder and Chairman of TOG. In June 2017, investment firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in TOG.

In September 2022, TOG and Fora announced the completion of a £1.5 billion merger, creating a company with 3.1 million square feet of space across the UK and Germany.


## Network Rail

In 2014, Network Rail and TOG announced they would open three drop-in workspaces in London King’s Cross railway station, Liverpool Street station and Leeds railway station as part of a joint venture called The Station Office Network, an initiative to provide mobile offices in railway stations throughout the UK’s major cities. TOG now has locations in six mainline railway stations; Marylebone, Paddington, Liverpool Street, Victoria, Waterloo and Leeds.
