Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation


# Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation



The Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (CSFI) is a think tank established in 1993 that seeks to engage in and promote free and progressive discussion about the challenges and opportunities facing the modern financial services sector. The aim of our research is to open thought-provoking debate about the financial services, with a view to making the industry more transparent, more inclusive and, above all, more sustainable. Following many years of collaboration on events and debates, and on Financial World, LIBF’s quarterly magazine, CSFI formally joined LIBF in November 2022.


## Activities

The CSFI holds round-table meetings, bringing together finance practitioners, regulators, academics and members of the professions. Prospect Magazine, in its annual Think Tank Awards for 2012, said: "The Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation retains its good reputation for scrutinising regulations and for roundtables".

The work of the CSFI focuses on the most significant drivers of change in the industry, including:

* technology – the potential impact of AI and other digital advances
* sustainable finance – the role of banks and financial regulators in tackling the risks associated with climate change
* finance for an ageing society – innovative solutions to pensions, housing and demographic issues
* the UK and Europe – the new world of trade and regulation
* financial inclusion – empowerment and education.

Other activities include hosting webinars, producing podcasts and writing and publishing a variety of written content including reports, white papers, short articles and blogs.
