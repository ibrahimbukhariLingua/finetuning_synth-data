Relations between Tanzania and Uganda had been strained for several years before the war started in 1978. After Idi Amin seized power in a military coup in 1971, the Tanzanian leader Julius Nyerere offered sanctuary to Uganda's ousted president, Milton Obote. After various coup attempts were made on Amin from Tanzania; Uganda declared a state of war against Tanzania, and sent troops to invade and annex part of the Kagera region of Tanzania, which Amin claimed belonged to Uganda.
