The stock of the company did well on the Dhaka Stock Exchange in 2018 based on rumors.

The government of Bangladesh considered liquidating the People's Leasing and Financial Services Limited and Bangladesh Industrial Finance Company Limited in July 2019 due to its failure to pay back its creditors. Individual and Small Depositors' Council of the non-bank financial institution, a pressure group, demanded the government restructure the institute rather than liquidate it.

Justice Muhammad Khurshid Alam Sarkar of the High Court Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court ordered the restructuring the financial institution to prevent its bankruptcy in 2021.

Proshanta Kumar Halder, managing director of Reliance Finance, was able to appoint his relatives in senior management positions of People's Leasing and Financial Services Limited and embezzled more than 35 billion taka from the institute. He was aided by the daughter of Khabir Uddin Ahmed, a director of People's Leasing and Financial Services Limited.
