# Neway Group Holdings Limited



**Neway Group Holdings Limited** (Chinese: 中星集團控股有限公司) SEHK: 55 is a Hong Kong-listed entertainment and printing company. Formerly known as **Chung Tai Printing Holdings Ltd.** (Chinese: 中大印刷集團控股有限公司), it was founded by Mr. Christopher Suek in 1979 as a small printing firm engaging in label stock printing. In 1983, Chung Tai Printing expanded into production of labels and overlays using material supplied by 3M Hong Kong Ltd. The labels and overlays business was later operated under the name of King's Industrial Co. and became one of the few authorized converters in Hong Kong for the manufacture of 3M labels, adhesive labels and overlays.
As business grown, The Greatime Offset Printing Co., Ltd was established in 1987 to conduct the offset printing business and to serve the growing market of brochures, manuals, booklets and other paper products. To lower cost, Chung Tai Printing (China) Co., Ltd was established in Shenzhen to take advantage of the competitive production costs.

Chung Tai Printing went into public listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1992.

To further expand and diversify its business, it acquired Neway Entertainment Group in 2009 and changed the Group's name to Neway Group Holdings Limited.
