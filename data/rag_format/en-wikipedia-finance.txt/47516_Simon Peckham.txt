In 2014, he was the highest paid FTSE-100 CEO, earning £31 million worth of Melrose shares as an incentive scheme matured.

### Melrose

Peckham is one of the founders of Melrose, and was chief operating officer and secretary from 2003. He had previously worked with fellow founders Roper and Miller at Wassall.

Peckham has been Melrose CEO since 9 May 2012, and CEO of Elster Group since 24 August 2012. In 2014, Peckham was the highest-paid FTSE-100 CEO, earning £31 million, this was due to the maturing of a five year share incentive scheme paid out to the three founders of Melrose.

Melrose’s £8bn purchase of GKN in 2018 was the biggest hostile takeover in the City of London since Kraft’s successful hostile takeover of Cadbury in 2009 and triggered a backlash from certain politicians and trade unions over fears of cuts to UK jobs and investment.
