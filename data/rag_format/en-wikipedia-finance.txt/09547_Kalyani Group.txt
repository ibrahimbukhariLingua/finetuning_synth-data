## Controversy

Baba Kalyani, Chairman of the group, became embroiled in a legal dispute with his sister Sugandha and her husband Jaidev Hiremath concerning control of Hikal Limited, a subsidiary of the Kalyani Group. They submitted a case in the Bombay High Court, alleging that Kalyani's move to increase his group's stake by 5% aimed to gain full control, sidelining and ousting them. The Hiremaths held 35% (valued at Rs 3,578 crore), while Kalyani possessed 34%. Hiremath contended that Kalyani selectively disregarded a significant 1994 note indicating the transfer of Hikal shares to Sugandha's family.

However, Kalyani refuted the 1994 transfer clause in the family arrangement, deeming it a false assertion by Sugandha. He acknowledged the October 1993 agreement mentioning Hikal's transfer to the Hiremaths but asserted it was overridden by the 1994 arrangement. Kalyani also noted that the Taj meeting centered on resolving ownership matters at Bharat Forge and Kalyani Forge, not acknowledging any Hikal agreement in 1994. InGovern, an advisory firm, expressed concerns about the lack of agreement between conflicting promoter groups due to differing shareholdings, hampering the passage of special resolutions. In response, Hikal accused InGovern of bias and spreading misinformation to damage the company's reputation. Hikal reaffirmed the Hiremath family's status as promoters, dismissing InGovern's claims and emphasizing that the ongoing lawsuit is a shareholder-level issue, unlikely to impact the company's performance.

In 2024, a new front opened in the row between Baba Kalyani and his sister Sugandha Sameer and Pallavi, children of Sugandha and Jai Hiremath, have filed suit in a Pune court seeking partition of the Kalyani family assets to claim their share of the Kalyani Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) assets.

Baba Kalyani, who turned 75 has a net worth of over $4 billion, was removed from his board position of Hikal in January 2024. Kalyani, who still remains the chairman of Bharat Forge, has been sparring with his sister Sugandha Hiremath over a family will. The suit states that while Baba Kalyani has derived several benefits from the 1994 Family Arrangement, he is refusing to meet his obligation to transfer the Hikal shares to Hiremaths.
