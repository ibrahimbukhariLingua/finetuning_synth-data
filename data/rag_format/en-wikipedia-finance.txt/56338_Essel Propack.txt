## History

The company was formed from the merger of two pre-existing companies, Essel Packaging and Propack AG led by then CEO Cyrus Bagwadia.

In 2002, Essel Propack set up a 60,000 sq.ft, US$15 Million manufacturing plant in Danville, Virginia, to make toothpaste tubes for Procter & Gamble's North American market. In the same year, the company set up its fourth plant in China.

The company was acquired by The Blackstone Group in 2019 during an assets sale of the debt-ridden Essel Group. The company was renamed to EPL Limited in October 2020.
