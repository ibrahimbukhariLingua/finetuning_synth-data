Challenge fund


# Challenge fund



A **Challenge Fund** (also referred to as **enterprise challenge fund**) is a competitive financing facility to disburse donor funding for international development projects, typically utilizing public sector or private foundation funds for market-based or incentive driven solutions. As Irwin and Porteous (2005) observed, "In practice, the objective of a challenge fund is to provide the smallest possible financial contribution to a socially worthwhile project consistent with making it less risky and more financially sustainable to the private promoter." Applicant qualifications differ widely among challenge funds, but typically focus on non-state actors.

Typically, a donor agency (such as UK's Department for International Development (DfID), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)) hires a development contractor (such as KPMG or Palladium International) to host the funding competition around a broader sector (such as food trade, agriculture, or education in a specific geography) to solicit innovative proposals that otherwise may not be discovered through more traditional grant-making or funding mechanisms. Alternatively, challenge funds are often used as ways to address what development partners describe as a Grand Challenge, which is a challenge fund focused on soliciting proposals around a very specific critical barrier that, if removed, would help solve an important health problem in the developing world, with a high likelihood of global impact through widespread implementation.

Typical features of a challenge fund include open competition, innovative or evidence-based proposals. Proposals are evaluated based on a fixed scoring criteria, and a governance structure that incorporates a voting committee to approve funding decisions. Other common features include a focus on innovation, leveraging other resources, and local solutions. Research performed by TripleLine Consulting identified seven characteristics of challenges funds: "(1) provides grants or subsidies (2) with an explicit public purpose (3) between independent agencies (4) with grant recipients selected competitively (5) on the basis of advertised rules and processes (6) who retain significant discretion over formulation and execution of their proposals and (7) share risks with the grant provider."

Challenge funds greatly differ in size, from over $200 million to under $5 million.


## History

Academia, medical research, and the social sectors have used challenge funds for several decades; however, what is now mostly referred to as challenge funds are a byproduct of DFID's efforts beginning in the 1990s. Early challenge funds in the social sector supported the use of public–private partnerships, for example in the UK for urban issues, including the City Challenge, Rural Challenge and Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Funds.

By 1997, over 50 challenge funds were operating in the UK, disbursing £3,390 million. Of these, the largest was the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB). The first challenge fund within the British overseas development assistance programme (now DFID or UKAid) was the 1997 Business Sector Challenge Fund, followed in 2000 by the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund and the Business Linkages Challenge Fund that were tested in East Africa and later expanded to other regions.


## Eligibility

Eligibility criteria vary from fund to fund.


## Effectiveness

The effectiveness of challenge funds has been evaluated, in part, by donors, consultants, and implementers with varying opinions as to their value for money and effectiveness. Additionally, certain donors such as SIDA have established guidelines to ensure challenge funds are as effective as possible at delivering the intended social impact.

| IAP Criteria | |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Clear commercial driver and potential for commercial viability |
| 2. | Potential to reach scale |
| 3. | Managed by a company or a market oriented organisation |
| 4. | Poor people benefit (income, products, environment, opportunities, gender equality) |
| 5. | Avoid negative effects (environmental, market distortion) |
| 6. | Clearly defined elements of cost-sharing (With the company itself providing at a minimum 50% - which should not come from other public financing) |
| 7. | Innovative; going beyond what exists now, in terms of the product /service, the delivery mechanism/business model and/or market reach |
| 8. | Project would not take place at the same scale or have the same development impact without IAP funding |
