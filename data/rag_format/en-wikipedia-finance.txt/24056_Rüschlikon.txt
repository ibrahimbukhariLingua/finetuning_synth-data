## History

Earliest archaeological findings are grave mounds from the early Iron Age Hallstatt culture (800-450BC) on the Zimmerberg mountain. The name of Rüschlikon is Alemannic and first appears in documents around 1153 as *Ruoslinchoven*. In the early 1980s, Rüschlikon blocked off many of the smaller side streets from Thalwil so that traffic between Zürich and Thalwil would be unable to use them.

The Swiss Re Centre for Global Dialogue is based in Rüschlikon. The centre is built in the grounds of the Villa Bodmer, which was owned by the Swiss industrialist Karl Martin Leonhard Bodmer.

The CEO of commodities company Glencore, Ivan Glasenberg, is a resident of Rüschlikon. Glasenberg paid 360 million SFr (£240m) in taxes to Rüschlikon following Glencore's flotation on the London Stock Exchange. The money enabled the residents to cut their taxation rate by 7%, which was approved by large majority after a public vote.

The money attracted criticism from some Rüschlikon residents with regards to Glencore's alleged controversial business practices. The finance director of nearby Winterthur village council, which is due to receive a large proportion of the money via a system that diverts funds to the poorest villages said that "I am not really happy about this money. I can't ignore who is actually paying the price for this and I don't like the fact that a few commodity traders make billions while the people in the producing countries remain bitterly poor."
