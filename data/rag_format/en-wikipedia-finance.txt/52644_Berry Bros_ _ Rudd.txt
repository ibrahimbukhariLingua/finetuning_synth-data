## History

Berry Bros. & Rudd was founded by the Widow Bourne in 1698 at 3 St. James's Street, London, which today is a Grade II\* listed building still used as the company's headquarters. No.3, as it is known, contained Berry Bros. & Rudd's main retail premises until mid-2017, when these moved around the corner to a purpose-built shop at 63 Pall Mall. The company has a discounted store next to its main warehouse in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and additional offices in Battersea as well as overseas in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

The company started out selling coffee, and then diversified into cocoa, tea, snuff, spices, and other exotic goods, quickly becoming one of London's most fashionable grocers. Its West End location and close proximity to St James's Palace also contributed to its growing popularity. In 1903 they formulated a ginger liqueur to revivify Edward VII from cold car journeys, still purveyed as *The King's Ginger*.

During the years, it has counted many famous customers among its clientele including: Lord Byron, William Pitt the Younger, the Aga Khan, and Beau Brummell.

In 2020, Emma Fox took on the role of CEO from Lizzy Rudd, who had been serving as interim Chief Executive since the departure of Dan Jago in 2019. Lizzy Rudd remains the Chair of the Board of Directors.

In 2023, the company acquired a minority stake in the Cotswolds Distillery and acquired a 50% stake in Hambledon Vineyard in Hampshire, England.
