The business was founded in 1962 and previously listed on the London Stock Exchange from 1997 to 2021. Aggreko was acquired by TDR Capital and I Squared Capital in August 2021.


## History

Aggreko was founded in The Netherlands by Luc Koopmans in 1962. It moved to Scotland in 1973. In 1984, it was acquired by Christian Salvesen plc in 1984, a Scottish transport and logistics company.

In 1997, the business demerged from Christian Salvesen and then listed on the London Stock Exchange.

In December 2001, its chief executive Chris Masters departed the business. He was succeeded by Phil Harrower who had worked his way up in the company from a junior salesman. Harrower was killed in a train collision in the USA where he was based in December 2002.

In 2003, it appointed Rupert Soames as its new chief executive who served for 11 years until 2014.

Aggreko acquired all the activities, other than those relating to large gas turbines, of General Electric Energy Rentals for around $212m in December 2006.

In March 2012, Aggreko acquired 100% of the operations of Poit Energia, a supplier of power generation equipment in Latin America.

In 2014, the company announced the departure of its chief executive Rupert Soames. He was replaced by Chris Weston, who took up the position in early 2015.

In July 2017, Aggreko announced the £40 million acquisition of battery storage company, Younicos. The acquisition was part of the company's plans to provide greener sources of electricity, transitioning away from diesel only generators.

In 2018, it announced a £33 million innovation programme to develop its next generation of power products.

In April 2021, the company agreed to be acquired by Albion Acquisitions Limited, owned by TDR Capital and I Squared Capital, in a transaction valued at £2.3 billion. This marked the business's delisting on the London Stock Exchange.

In November 2021, the company appointed Blair Illingworth as its chief executive.

In September 2022, Aggreko launched a new business unit in North America called Aggreko Energy Transition Solutions, which will develop, own and operate clean energy and sustainable infrastructure.
