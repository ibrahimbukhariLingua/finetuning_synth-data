After graduation, Hugh Smith spent four years practicing law before at Inner Temple. He subsequently spent eight years working for textile firm Courtaulds between 1960 and 1968.

In 1968, Hugh Smith followed the family path to work in the City of London, joining stockbroker Capel-Cure Myers. In 1979 he became senior partner at Capel-Cure Myers. In anticipation of ”Big Bang”, he oversaw the sale of Capel-Cure Myers to ANZ Merchant Bank, of which he became Deputy Chairman.
