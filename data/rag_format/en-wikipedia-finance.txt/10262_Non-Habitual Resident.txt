Non-Habitual Resident


# Non-Habitual Resident



The tax regime for **non-habitual residents** (commonly known as **NHR**s or **NHR Tax Regime**), formally known as **non-regular residents**, was created with the approval of the Investment Tax Code, approved by Decree-Law n. 249/2009, of 23 September. It changed the rules of the Portuguese Personal Income Tax, by granting a set of tax exemptions and flat rate taxation for a period of 10 years, in order to attract to Portugal, expat professionals qualified in activities with high added value or intellectual, industrial or know-how, as well as pensioners and other passive income earners.


## Tax benefits

Under the initial rules set in the NHR regime the following tax rates applied, in Portugal, to the income of those duly enrolled in it:

| Types of Income | Taxation in Portugal on Income of national Source | Taxation in Portugal on Income from Foreign Source until 2020 | Taxation in Portugal on Income from Foreign Source after 2020 | Taxation In Portugal on Income from Blacklisted Jurisdictions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pensions | Up to 48% | 0% | 10% | 10% |
| Employment Income from High-Added Value Activities | 20% | 0% | 0% | 20% |
| Employment Income | Up to 48% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Business or Professional Income from High-Added Value Activities | 20% | 20% | 20% | 20% |
| Business of Professional Income | Up to 48% | 0% | 0% | Up to 48% |
| Intellectual or Industrial Property Income | 16,5% or 28% | 0% | 0% | 16,5% or 28% |
| Capital Income | 28% | 0% | 0% | 35% |
| Rental Income | 25% | 0% | 0% | 25% |
| Capital Gains (Shares) | 28% | 0% | 0% | 28% |
| Capital Gains (Real Estate) | 14,5% - 28% | 0% | 0% | 14,5% - 28% |
| Trusts | 28% | 0% | 0% | 35% |


### Critics and reform

The above rules allowed for the double non-taxation on pensions, specially for those sourced in Scandinavian countries, such as Finland and Sweden, and in France. This situation lead to Finland and Sweden to revoke their taxation agreements with Portugal.

With the approval of the 2020 State Budget Law, by the Assembly of the Republic, the Portuguese Government addressed the vocal critics of other EU-Member States by implementing changes to the regime, namely regarding pension income.
