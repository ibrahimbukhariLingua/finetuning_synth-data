Within each of these divisions, a number of flavours are produced, for instance Fruit Corners are available in Blackberry & Raspberry, Blueberry, Cherry, Peach & Apricot, Raspberry and Strawberry flavours.

## Animal abuse

In September 2024, *The Independent* released footage from dairy farms supplying Müller showing animal abuse and neglect. Workers were seen repeatedly hitting cows with metal chains and poles, with one employee observed jabbing a cow with a screwdriver. The RSPCA described the footage as "completely unacceptable".


## Marketing and advertising

In December 2004, Müller released a new set of adverts using the song by Nina Simone, "Ain't Got No, I Got Life". In 2008, Müller introduced a new advert featuring their factory based in Shropshire, and emphasising the closeness of supply from the surrounding area of its factory in Market Drayton; "24 hours from farm to yogurt".

In October 2011, Müller launched a new slogan, "Wünderful Stuff". This was backed by a new advertising campaign involving people being turned into various popular cartoon characters and also featured an appearance by KITT, which first aired on 8 October on ITV1, during that night's edition of *The X Factor*.

Müller was the main shirt sponsor for English football club Aston Villa as part of a two-year deal from 1993 until 1995, during which time they won the Football League Cup. The sponsorship ended when the club accepted a sponsorship offer from AST Research. The American singer Nicole Scherzinger has appeared in Müller adverts.
