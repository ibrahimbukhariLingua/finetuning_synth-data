In the 1950s, Gandel took control of his parents' women's clothing business (then named Sussan) and with his brother-in-law Marc Besen grew it into a chain of over 200 stores. In 1983, he bought the Chadstone Shopping Centre, selling Sussan to his brother-in-law in 1985 to concentrate on real estate. He subsequently built his fortune in shopping centres.

In July 1983, Myer sold the Chadstone Shopping Centre to the Gandel Group for $37 million, which has since managed and developed the complex into Australia's biggest shopping mall which is nowʷʰᵉⁿ? valued at over A$3 billion.
