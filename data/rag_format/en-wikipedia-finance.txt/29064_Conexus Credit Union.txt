## History

In 1937, Tom Molloy, a reporter turned labour leader organized and created the Regina Co-operative Savings and Credit Union, which later came to be named Sherwood Credit Union. Sherwood Credit Union (later Conexus Credit Union) in 1976 implemented the first automated teller machine in Canada at its two branches in Regina. The project was developed for Sherwood Credit Union by the IT staff of CIS (Co-operative Insurance Services - later CGI) under contract to Saskatchewan Cooperative Credit Services (later Saskcentral). This venture involved cooperation from IBM Canada.
