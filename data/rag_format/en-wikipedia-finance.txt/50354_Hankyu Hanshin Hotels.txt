## History

The origins of the business can be traced back to 1926, when Ichizō Kobayashi, the founder of Hankyu Railway acquired the Takarazuka Hotel in Takarazuka.

On August 8, 1964, the New Hankyu Hotel opened in Umeda, Osaka, incorporated with Hankyu Umeda Station.

On May 26, 2000, Daiichi Hotel Ltd. went bankrupt after applying for the Corporate Rehabilitation Law.

On November 1, 2001, Hankyu Corporation invested 1 billion yen to purchase the Daiichi Hotels Group. Following its acquisition in 2002, it became a subsidiary of Hankyu Hotels.

On April 1, 2005, Hankyu-Daiichi Hotels Company Ltd. and Hotel New Hankyu Group was merged to become Hankyu-Daiichi Hotels Group.

On October 1, 2006, Hankyu Holdings became the wholly owning parent company of Hanshin Electric Railway Co., Ltd. and the holdings were renamed Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, Inc. Hankyu-Daiichi Hotels also changed the legal name to **Hankyu Hanshin-Daiichi Hotels Co., Ltd.** on the same day.
