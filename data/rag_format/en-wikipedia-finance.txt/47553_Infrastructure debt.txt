## Characteristics

Infrastructure debt, in comparison to infrastructure equity, has many distinct characteristics. Infrastructure debt is a short-term investment that has lower returns. It is much less risky and it does not generally benefit from the same inflation. This results from the majority of companies use floating rate debt or inflation linked-bonds. When dealing with floating rate debt, interest payments and bank bills move in unison. That is, a rise in inflation causes a rise in bank bill rates. Inflation-linked bonds occur when interest and principal payments are linked to CPI. Infrastructure debt has many defining characteristics that separate it from other infrastructure assets.


## Funds

Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) suggests that most UK and European pension funds wishing to gain a degree of exposure to infrastructure debt have done so indirectly, through investments made in infrastructure funds managed by specialized UK, Canadian, US and Australian funds. Sequoia Investment Management Company, based in London, has launched Sequoia Economic Infrastructure Income Fund targeted at fund managers and institutional investors.

On 29 November 2011, the British government unveiled an unprecedented plan to encourage large-scale pension investments in new roads, hospitals, airports... etc. across the UK. The plan is aimed at enticing 20 billion pounds ($30.97 billion) of investment in domestic infrastructure projects "over the next decade", which could mark the beginning of a new wave of pension fund investment in infrastructure in the UK.
