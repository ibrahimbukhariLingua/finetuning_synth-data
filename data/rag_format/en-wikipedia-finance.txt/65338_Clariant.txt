## Business history

The company started in 1995, as a spinoff (IPO) of the chemical operations of Sandoz, which then merged its pharmaceutical business with that of Ciba-Geigy to form Novartis. (Ciba-Geigy also went on to spin out its chemical operations, called Ciba Specialty Chemicals, which was later acquired by BASF.) In 1997, Clariant grew substantially, with the acquisition of the Hoechst speciality chemicals business.

In 2000, Clariant bought British Tar Products (BTP plc), in 2006 Clariant bought Ciba's Masterbatches division, and in 2011 Clariant acquired German speciality chemical company Süd-Chemie. In 2013, Clariant divested its textile chemicals, emulsions and paper specialities businesses to SK Capital. In 2014, Clariant divested its leather services to Stahl Holdings and its detergents & intermediates business to Weylchem of the International Chemical Investors Group. In 2016, Clariant partnered with matchmycolor LLC, a colour know-how company and Konica Minolta Inc, a Japanese technology company to efficiently colour match the polyolefin products easier and faster. In the same year, Clariant acquired Kel-Tech and X-Chem in the U.S.

In May 2017, Clariant and Huntsman Corporation announced that they would merge, as equals, forming HuntsmanClariant which would be the global leader in specialty chemical production - with the deal valued at $20 billion. Clariant shareholders will own 52% of the new entity, with Huntsman shareholders owning the remaining 48% of shares.

In October 2017, the merger between Clariant and Huntsman Corporation was halted due to concerns that a two-thirds shareholder approval, required by Swiss law, could not be reached. The all stock transaction would not have found support by White Tale Holdings, which continues to accumulate stocks while opposing the consolidation.

On 25 January 2018, White Tale Holdings, which is a partnership between hedge fund Corvex Management LP and investment group 40 North, ended its hostility and sold 25% of its stake to SABIC despite previous assertions that it was a long term holder. Clariant and SABIC subsequently signed a memorandum and a governance agreement.

In 2019, Clariant divested its Healthcare Packaging business to Arsenal Capital Partners. One year later, Clariant completed the sale of its entire Masterbatches business to PolyOne (rebranding to the name Avient in the same year). Two years later, in 2022, Clariant sold its Pigments business to a consortium of Heubach Group and SK Capital Partners. Clariant reinvested to retain a 20% stake in the new holding company.

In 2021, Clariant and India Glycols Limited (IGL) announced the successful creation of their 51-49% joint venture for renewable ethylene oxide (EO) derivatives after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals. The joint venture operates under the name Clariant IGL Specialty Chemicals Private Limited (CISC). In the same year, Clariant acquired the remaining 70% in Beraca, a Brazilian manufacturer of natural ingredients for the personal care sector. Clariant has held a 30% stake in the company since 2015.

On 23 November 2021, Clariant unveiled a new purpose-led strategy with four dimensions based on its purpose, »Greater chemistry – between people and planet«, accompanied by new financial and non-financial targets.

On 14 February 2022, Clariant delayed the release of its 2021 annual report and postponed the annual general meeting of shareholders, after saying the company is investigating allegations by internal whistleblowers that staff manipulated accounts to meet financial targets. On 27 April 2022, Clariant announced the conclusion of the investigation conducted by independent advisors and external counsel. The results of the investigation had no impact on the sales, cash and cash equivalents figures reported in 2020 and 2021.

In October 2022, Clariant acquired BASF’s U.S. Attapulgite business assets for USD 60 million in cash.

In April 2024, Clariant acquired Lucas Meyer Cosmetics from International Flavors & Fragrances for $810 million.


## Business units and business segments
