Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance


# Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance



The **Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance** (LVGEA) is a 501(c)6 membership organization led by President and CEO Jonas R. Peterson established to promote economic diversification and growth in Clark County, Nevada, including the Cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, Boulder City, and Mesquite. The organization was formed as the Southern Nevada Industrial Foundation in 1956, later known as the Nevada Development Authority, and finally renamed the LVGEA in 2013. The organization has helped attract, retain and expand companies including Levi Strauss & Co., Bank of America, Zappos and SolarCity to the Las Vegas area. The organization stated an intent to raise $7.5 million over three years through its Engage Southern Nevada Investment campaign.


## Economic development

The LVGEA is the Southern Nevada regional economic development authority as defined in NRS 231.1571. The organization is also the author and owner of the Southern Nevada Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS).


## Education

The LVGEA Education Council is led by LVGEA Chairman Emeritus Glenn Christenson and United Way of Southern Nevada Vice President of Community Development Terri Janison. The council has hosted events with local educators including Clark County School District Superintendent Pat Skorkowsky.


## Transportation

In 2013, the LVGEA supported Nevada Legislature Bill AB 413, which allows the Clark County Board of Commissioners to index fuel taxes to inflation. The LVGEA asserted if AB 413 passed, more than $800 million in road construction funding for Clark County could be raised and 11,000 new jobs were possible. The Bill was approved June 12, 2013.

In May 2016, the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance’s board of directors unanimously approved a resolution supporting the extension of Fuel Revenue Indexing. The proposed 10-year extension of the current program will be on the ballot as an initiative this November in Clark County.


## Immigration reform

In July 2014, the LVGEA endorsed comprehensive immigration reform that “secures our borders, expands the temporary worker and employer-sponsored green cards programs, creates a balanced and workable employment verification system, and provides a legalization program with tight criteria and eventual citizenship.” U.S. Senator for Nevada Harry Reid supported the position stating, “I was glad to hear that the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance recently endorsed immigration reform."
