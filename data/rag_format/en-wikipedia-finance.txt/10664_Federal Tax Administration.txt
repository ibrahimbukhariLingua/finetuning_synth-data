# Federal Tax Administration



The **Federal Tax Administration (FTA)** is the federal office responsible for federal revenue collection and the application of federal tax laws in the cantons. It is subordinated to the Federal Department of Finance.


## Tasks

The FTA collects various taxes and duties in Switzerland. These include:

* the value added tax (VAT)
* the federal direct tax (FDT)
* the withholding tax
* the stamp duty
* the military service substitute tax

Subdivisions of the FTA also take care of the application and enforcement of tax law, provide information on tax issues, further develop the tax system and help resolve international tax issues (e.g., double taxation agreements).
