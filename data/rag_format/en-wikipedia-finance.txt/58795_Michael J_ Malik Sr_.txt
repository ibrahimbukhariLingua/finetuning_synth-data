## Detroit casino development

As a partner with NAG, Malik directed a ballot effort to bring casino gambling to Detroit, Michigan. In 1996, NAG teamed with Atwater Entertainment to support the passage of a Michigan statewide proposal facilitating the development of three commercial casinos in Detroit. Following passage of the proposal, Malik worked with state elected officials to negotiate and implement the regulatory oversight framework for the Detroit casinos.

Malik was a partner in the casino group Detroit Entertainment, which included Marina Ilitch and more than 130 local partners. Detroit Entertainment selected Mandalay Bay Group as casino operator, and Malik worked with them on the development of the casino project now called
MotorCity Casino. His efforts have resulted in an entertainment industry in Detroit that today exceeds $1.3 billion per year.


## Native American gaming

Malik helped develop a casino for the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians in Manistee in northwest Michigan. He was responsible for site selection and land acquisition, construction firm selection, assistance in obtaining a gaming compact, and establishing casino operations. Today the Little River Casino is the third most profitable Indian owned and operated casino of the 18
located in Michigan.

Malik also assisted in the development of two casinos, a hotel and a golf course for the Bay Mills Indian Tribe in Brimley, Michigan. He assisted the tribe with the legislative approval process for obtaining the first gaming compact in Michigan. Malik is currently working with the Bay Mills Tribe to develop a casino in Port Huron, Michigan.

Malik is managing partner in the casino development group BarWest L.L.C., and is working with the Los Coyotes Band from San Diego County, California to construct and operate a world-class casino complex in Barstow, California.
