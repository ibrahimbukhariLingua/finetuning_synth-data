## Premise

Investigative journalist Bea discovers dubious practices in Stockholm's financial sector. There are contradictions between ST Bank's credit losses and those declared in its latest official quarterly report. That report claims the bank is completely solid with their recent financial performance exceeding expectations. Bea's situation is complicated by her clandestine affair with Peder, the married CEO of ST Bank. Peder is unwilling to publicly admit to any problems at his bank. Bea receives anonymous emails, which declare that the bank's losses are even higher than previously indicated. Bea learns that Peder has lied to the media, while she considers whether to reveal her lover's financial fraud.
