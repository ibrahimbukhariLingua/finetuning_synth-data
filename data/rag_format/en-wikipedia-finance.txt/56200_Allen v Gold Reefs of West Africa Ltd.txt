Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd


# Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd



***Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd*** [1900] 1 Ch 656 is a UK company law case concerning alteration of a company's articles of association. It held that alterations could not be interfered with by the court unless the change that had been made was not bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole. This rule served as a marginal form of minority shareholder protection at common law, before the existence of any unfair prejudice remedy.


## Facts

Gold Reefs’ articles gave it a "first and paramount lien" (the right to retain possession) on all partly paid shares held by any member for any debt owed to the company. Mr Zuccani held some partly paid up shares. He also owned the only fully paid up shares issued by the company. He died insolvent. The company altered its articles by special resolution to create a lien on all fully paid shares (deleting the words in brackets of ‘upon all shares (not fully paid) held by such members’). Mr Allen, one of the executors of Mr Zuccani (trying to get money back) sued to get the fully paid shares’ value.

Kekewich J held the company could not enforce the lien. The company appealed.


## Judgment

Lord Lindley MR held the alteration of the company's articles was valid to introduce a lien on fully paid up shares. So long as the resolution was done bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole, restrictions on freedom of a company to alter its articles are invalid. According to Lord Lindley MR the power to change the articles is,

> like all other powers [to] be exercised to those general principles of law and equity which are applicable to all powers conferred on majorities and enabling them to bind minorities. It must be exercised, not only in the manner required by law, but also bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole, and it must not be exceeded. These conditions are always implied, and are seldom, if ever, expressed...
> 
> How shares shall be transferred, and whether the company shall have any lien on them, are clearly matters of regulation properly prescribed by a company’s articles of association...
> 
> It is easy to imagine cases in which even a member of a company may acquire by contract or otherwise special rights against the company, which exclude him from the operation of a subsequently altered article...
> 
> The altered articles applied to all holders of fully paid shares, and made no distinction between them. The directors cannot be charged with bad faith.

Romer LJ agreed. Vaughan Williams LJ dissented.
