Roda (markets)


# Roda (markets)



**Roda** (Serbian Cyrillic: Рода, lit. 'Stork') is a chain of retail stores that began operating in 1994 by opening its first location in Kula. By developing a retail network of megamarkets, first in Vojvodina, and then throughout Serbia, Roda positioned itself as a store for large and family purchases.


## History

In October 2006, Mercator Group from Slovenia bought 76% of shares of the M-Rodić company at 116 million euros and thus became the majority owner of Roda Markets. The process of the complete take-over of the company was completed in 2009, when Roda became a part of Mercator-S, and since April 2021 it has been an integral part of the Fortenova Group retail.


### Retail network

Under the slogan "Where the family is", Roda meets the needs of large family purchases. This brand has 33 stores throughout Serbia.
