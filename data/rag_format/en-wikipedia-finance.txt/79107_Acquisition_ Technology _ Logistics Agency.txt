# Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency



The **Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency** (防衛装備庁, *Bōei sōbi-chō*, ATLA) is an agency established under the Japanese Ministry of Defense that handles project management, technology management, research and development, and procurement of defense equipment for the Japan Self-Defense Forces. ATLA is a part of the defense policy of then-Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to bolster the military by streamlining and reforming the country's defense industry and military equipment acquisition.


## History

In 2014, the Ministry of Defense began to implement reforms to adapt to the increasing tensions in security environment surrounding Japan and the changes in defense policy under Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. As part of the Medium Term Defense Program (FY 2014-2018) the Ministry of Defense pursued organizational restructuring, which includes the integration of all departments that handles equipment acquisition into one agency.

The Ministry of Defense included the reforms in the FY2015 defense budget; which included the establishment of ATLA and reorganization of the Internal Bureau to accompany with ATLA's establishment. ATLA's formation involved integrating any divisions related to procurement or research and development from other departments into one bureau. These departments include the Internal Bureau's Bureau of Finance & Equipment, Staff Offices, Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI), and Equipment Procurement and Construction Office.

ATLA was formed on October 1, 2015.


## Duties

ATLA manages the research and development and procurement of military technology for Japan, through by collaborations with universities, or domestic/international industry companies.
