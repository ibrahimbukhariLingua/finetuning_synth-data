## Controversies

In 2022, Sun Pharma was listed in the Leave Russia database for continuing its operations in Russia despite international sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. While many global pharmaceutical companies reduced or ceased their activities in Russia, Sun Pharma maintained its business presence, raising ethical concerns about corporate responsibility during geopolitical conflicts. Critics argue that by remaining in the Russian market, the company indirectly supports the local economy, contradicting broader efforts to isolate Russia financially.


## SPARC

In 2007, Sun Pharma demerged its innovative R&D arm, and listed it separately on the stock market as the Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (NSE: SPARC, BSE: 532872). In 2013, SPARC declared revenue of ₹873 million. SPARC focuses on new chemical entities (NCE) research and new drug delivery systems and offers an annual update of its pipeline (NDDS).
