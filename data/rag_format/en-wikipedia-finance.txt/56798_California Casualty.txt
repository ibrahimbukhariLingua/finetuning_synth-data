## History

In 1914 Carl G. Brown, Sr. started California Casualty Indemnity Exchange as a customer-owned company offering workers' compensation insurance to California's new and growing industries. The company was based on Carl G. Brown, Sr.’s high ethical standards and business integrity. In 1917 California Casualty began offering auto insurance, followed by home insurance in 1954. His son, Carl G. Brown, Jr. took over as chairman in 1957 and, in 1965 codified his father's principles in the California Casualty Code.

In 1951 California Casualty pioneered what is now an industry trend of affinity insurance programs when it received the endorsement of the California Teachers Association (CTA) to provide auto and home insurance to its members. Sixty years later they still serve CTA and its members and expanded nationally with over 100 other endorsements including the National Education Association (NEA); many police, state trooper, and firefighter associations; and universities and medical centers.

In 1978, after Carl G. Brown, Jr. retired, his son, Tom Brown, carried on the family tradition and moved up to chairman of the board. Under Tom's leadership the business expanded across the country when it received the NEA endorsement.

In 2007 Beau Brown continued as the fourth generation to head California Casualty, becoming the company's president and chief executive officer. In 2013, he was named chairman and CEO and Joe Volponi became California Casualty's president. In 2021, Bob Nicolay temporarily stepped into the role of CEO with Brown remaining chairman of the board.

In 2022 Jonathan Adkisson joins California Casualty as the new president and chief executive officer. Beau Brown continues as chairman of the board and Bob Nicolay returns as a member of the board of directors.

## Programs

Impact Teen Drivers - California Casualty Group teamed with the California Teachers Association (CTA) and the California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) to launch a teen driver awareness program aimed at saving young lives.

The program is geared directly toward the newest drivers — 10th graders — and it focuses on making them aware of the dangers of distracted driving. The public information campaign officially launched in April 2008. The website, What Do You Consider Lethal? gives teens a chance to learn from others' experiences of the impact of bad driving judgments.

## The Carl Brown, Jr. Award of Excellence

On January 1, 1980, the company established the Carl G. Brown, Jr. Award of Excellence, an annual award to be given to California Casualty Management Company employee for excellence in their performance of business activities and involvement in the community.

Although many companies have such annual awards for top-performing employees, the Carl Brown, Jr. Award of Excellence has a unique theme. Tom Brown felt that the award should have a permanent exhibit in the California Casualty Group's home offices. Edward J. Fraughton, a well-known artist from Utah was commissioned to create a sculpture of a mountain man. Fraughton created two pieces, the first entitled "Edge of Silence," is the permanent exhibit and the second entitled “The Pathfinder” is given as the annual award. The Carl G. Brown, Jr. Award goes to an employee for excellence in their performance of business activities and involvement in the community.
