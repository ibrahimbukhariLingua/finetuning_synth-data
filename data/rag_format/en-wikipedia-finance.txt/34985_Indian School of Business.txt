Indian School of Business


# Indian School of Business



The **Indian School of Business** (**ISB**) is a private business school with campuses in Hyderabad and Mohali, India. It offers certificates in various post-graduate management programs.


## History

The Indian School of Business (ISB) was started in 1996 by a bunch of businessmen and academics. Co-founders Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, senior executives of McKinsey & Company, directed teams of McKinsey consultants to start the school. Gupta recruited U.S. business leaders while Kumar recruited Indian leaders for its executive board. Formal partnerships were established with international business schools Wharton and Kellogg. Pramath Sinha, then a junior partner at McKinsey in India, was persuaded to take a leave of absence to be the school's first dean. Rajat Gupta became the school's first chairman and was succeeded by Adi Godrej in 2011. The then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Sri N. Chandrababu Naidu played an important role for establishment of ISB in Hyderabad. The foundation stone for the campus was laid in 1999 and was inaugurated by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2001. The Government of Punjab sanctioned the Mohali Campus in 2010; its foundation stone was laid in September 2010 by Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, and was inaugurated in December 2012 by the then Union Minister of Finance, P. Chidambaram.

## Campuses

## Academics


### Accreditation

ISB is accredited by AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB. ISB became the 100th Triple Accredited institution in the world upon achieving AMBA accreditation on 12 May 2020.

ISB is not accredited by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and has not applied for such accreditation, as it offers a certificate program and not a degree or a diploma. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has ruled that for the purposes of US Visa and Green Cards, the post-graduate PGP certificate awarded by ISB is not equivalent to a Master of Business Administration degree, unlike similarly named certificates awarded by the Indian Institutes of Management.


### Programmes

ISB is the academic partner for the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women Entrepreneurs Certificate programme in India which provides management education to "under-served women".
