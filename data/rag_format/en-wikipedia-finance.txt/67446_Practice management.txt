Practice management


# Practice management



**Practice management** is the term used in General practice for the person who manages the finance and administration of a doctor's office or an office of a medical professional in one of many types of specialties in medicine. This is distinct from other official titles such as Advanced Practice Manager, which are generally clinical. A practice manager is responsible for the administrative responsibilities of daily operations and development of a business strategy. Most practice managers are responsible for hiring staff, negotiating benefits and personnel policies, ensuring that medical supplies are ordered and equipment is maintained, ensuring regulatory compliance, and the development and marketing of service lines. Practice management encompasses multiple topics including governance, the financial aspects of medical billing, staff management, ancillary service development, information technology, transcription utilization, and marketing. Practice managers handle the business aspects of medicine to maximize provider time and enhance patient care.


## General practice

The job of the practice manager has evolved over the last century. When general practice was a cottage industry, operating in the doctor's front room, the receptionist, and the manager, insofar as there was any management, was often the doctor's wife. In the 21st century the biggest practices in the UK now have more than 200,000 patients and hundreds of staff over dozens of sites. Some practices, however, are still single handed. Working conditions in rural areas are very different from those in cities. By no means all the jobs are full time. About half the practice managers surveyed in the UK reported working from five to eight additional hours per week, not all of it paid. Average salary was Â£39,334.17

The role of a practice manager often includes managing the patient recall process for preventative healthcare appointments. In the UK, primary care providers must meet QOF targets and Local Enhanced Services. Much of the work of practice managers over the financial year goes towards meeting these targets as they are a key generator of practice revenue. As an important of preventing ill-health, there has been much academic research into improving the uptake of these targeted appointments. For example, there has been a number of studies into improving uptake of the NHS Health Check programme.

Modern practice managers are increasingly using advanced practice management systems to enhance operational efficiency and patient care. These systems include features such as automated scheduling, electronic health records management, and real-time analytics. The integration of these technologies helps improve appointment adherence, streamline billing processes, and enhance patient communication through automated reminders and follow-ups. Additionally, the adoption of telehealth services has become an important aspect of contemporary practice management, allowing providers to extend their reach and offer remote consultations, which benefits rural and underserved areas.
