## History

The origins of the firm go back to 1841 when Edward Burges set up as a sole practitioner. His father and grandfather had both been lawyers before him.

Following the death of the founder in 1890, the practice was continued by his son W. E. Parry Burges who formed a partnership with a Mr Sloan, resulting in the name becoming Burges & Sloan. In 1947 the partnership was joined by Stuart Evans, who was then practising alone as Salmon, Cumberland and Evans. The firm's move to Narrow Quay House in 1982 saw the shortening of the name to "Burges Salmon".

In 2010, Burges Salmon re-located from Narrow Quay to its current head office at One Glass Wharf in the Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone. In 2012, the firm also moved its London offices from Chancery Exchange to New Street Square, enabling it to operate from both Bristol and London.

Burges Salmon has authored a number of publications including the *Burges Salmon Guide to Nuclear Law* and the *Burges Salmon Guide for Landowners and Farmers*, also known as *The Pink Book* ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.

In 2008, allegations were made against Burges Salmon that sub-prime loans may have been mis-sold to farmers, and was investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. In October 2010 the Solicitors Regulation Authority announced that it had closed the investigation with no further action.
