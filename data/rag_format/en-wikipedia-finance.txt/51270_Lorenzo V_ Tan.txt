### Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation

Lorenzo Tan was president and chief executive officer of RCBC for 9 years, from 2007 to 2016. During his first year with RCBC he steered the bank to a 56% growth in its net income at Php 3.21 billion, the steepest profit growth among the Philippines' top 10 banks. In 2009 RCBC recorded a 54% increase in its net income at Php3.33 billion. This was followed by net incomes of Php4.28 billion in 2010, Php5.9 billion in 2011, and peaking at Php5.94 billion in 2012.

It was also during his tenure as president that the bank was able to secure several equity and debt capital raisings, including Cathay Life Insurance Co. Ltd of Taiwan (Php8 billion in 2015), CVC Capital Partners (US$115 million in 2012), and the International Finance Corporation led US$320 million bond issue, which in 2015 was "the largest dollar-denominated bond issuance by a Philippine bank.

Tan also initiated the acquisition of 49% of Grepalife by Sunlife Financial Philippines, creating Sunlife-Grepa Financial, the third largest bancassurance partnership in the Philippines.

RCBC was also the recipient of numerous banking awards and recognitions during Tan's turn at the helm of the bank. This includes being named by Asiamoney Magazine as "Best Domestic Private Bank" and the "Overall Best Private Bank in the Philippines" for four straight years. Asiamoney also recognized RCBC for being the "Best Domestic Provider for Overall FX Services in the Philippines" and "Best Domestic Provider for FX Options in the Philippines."

During his term as President and CEO OF RCBC, Tan also served as Executive Vice Chairman of RCBC, Vice-Chairman of RCBC Savings Bank, Director of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., and a Director of RCBC Capital Corporation.


#### Bangladesh Bank Heist Controversy

In February 2016, RCBC became involved in the Bangladesh bank heist when one of the bank's branches was used by still unidentified hackers to transfer US$81 million, of the total US$951million that was initially stolen from the Bangladesh Central Bank.

In the wake of the incident, Tan went on voluntary leave in order to give the bank a free hand in its investigation. But even after being cleared by the bank's independent investigation, Tan still chose to resign as head of RCBC on May 6, 2016 to take "full moral responsibility" for the incident. He was also subsequently cleared by all other investigating government agencies.

Tan filed civil and criminal cases against the former RCBC bank manager at the center of the controversy for libel and perjury after she dragged his name into the case. The manager admitted to lying in her statements given to the committee conducting an investigation in the Philippine Senate. On January 10, 2019, Deguito was found guilty of money laundering in connection with the $81-million cyber heist on Bangladesh's central bank. She was sentenced to 4 to 7 years in prison for each of the 8 counts of money laundering by the Makati Regional Trial Court. She was also fined a total of $109 million.

Subsequent investigations into the hacking, which are being conducted by the Federal prosecutors in the United States, have revealed that the government of North Korea may have possibly had a role in the theft of the US$81 Million. Some or all of the stolen funds may have found its way to North Korea. The FBI is examining the totalitarian state’s link to the hack, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the investigation. US National Security Agency Deputy Director Rick Ledgett was also quoted as saying that, “If that linkage from the Sony actors to the Bangladeshi bank actors is accurate — that means that a nation state is robbing banks."

The U.S. has charged a North Korean computer programmer with the 2016 cyber-heist of Bangladesh's central bank, among other celebrated global hacking attacks, alleging they were carried out on behalf of the regime in Pyongyang. The hacks also included the WannaCry 2.0 virus, the 2014 Sony Pictures attack. The hack of the central bank of Bangladesh saw at least $81 million stolen and transferred between a number of accounts in the Philippines and elsewhere, rendering most of it unrecoverable.

On March 23, 2020, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York has finally dismissed the case filed by Bangladesh Bank to RCBC and its officers. Due to its failure to state a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Conspiracy act claim, the US Court has granted the defendant’s joint motion for dismissal.

The controversy that dragged his reputation finally comes to a conclusion. The situation was seen as Bangladesh Bank’s neglect and inefficiency has caused the situation to happen.


### Sun Life of Canada (Philippines)

From 2005 to 2007, Tan was responsible for the business growth and leadership of Sun Life Financial in the Philippines. This consisted of three businesses: insurance, pre-need and mutual funds.

The insurance company was the second largest in the Philippines in 2005 with total assets in excess of Php60 billion, with a more than 2,300 strong agency force, and 53 branches and sales offices nationwide. By year-end 2006, Sun Life pre-need leapt to the number one position (from 6th), its mutual funds business overtook its main competitor, and its life insurance unit remained a strong second. That same year he was awarded the Insurance CEO (CEO EXCEL Awards) of the year by IABC/Phils.

While serving as President and CEO of the Philippine National Bank, Tan was responsible for managing the fourth largest private bank in the Philippines with 324 domestic branches and 99 overseas offices with total assets in excess of Php 200 billion.

Tan joined the PNB on April 10, 2002 upon the invitation of its two major shareholders, namely, the government-owned Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) and the Lucio Tan Group. At that time, the PDIC had just infused P7.8 billion in equity, in the form of preferred shares in the bank, in line with its five-year rehabilitation program. Tan was given the "principal mandate to lead the five-year rehabilitation efforts and turn around the financial performance from losses to profits." He is credited with the adoption of the "good bank-bad bank" strategy, which resulted in the early recovery of government funds, including premium in just the third year of the five-year rehabilitation program. During his term as president of PNB, Tan was able to steer the bank to its first profitability in 6 years with Php 168 million net income in 2003 versus P2 billion projected loss, reversing Php 33 billion losses in 5 years.

Just one year later, following some structural, operational and capital changes, RCBC was able to report a 56% jump in unaudited net income to P3.21 billion (US$77.2 million); the steepest profit growth among the country's top 10 banks for that year. Before taking charge at RCBC, Tan was at the helm of Sun Life of Canada (Philippines) for 18 months, during which time he took the company to higher levels in insurance, the pre-need industry and mutual funds.

Prior to that, he was able to reverse the fortunes of the formerly state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB). One year under Tan's watch, PNB was able to go from five straight years of losses to enter the black in 2003. It then doubled net income in 2004 and was ready for privatization the following year, two years ahead of schedule.
