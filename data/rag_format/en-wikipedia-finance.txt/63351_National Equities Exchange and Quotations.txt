National Equities Exchange and Quotations


# National Equities Exchange and Quotations



The **National Equities Exchange and Quotations** (**NEEQ**) is a Chinese over-the-counter system for trading the shares of a public limited company (Chinese: 股份有限公司; lit. 'Company Limited by Shares') that is not listed on either the Shenzhen Stock Exchange or Shanghai Stock Exchange. The NEEQ exchange was also nicknamed the "New Third Board" (Chinese: 新三板) in China, as there were formerly two trading systems that the NEEQ replaced: STAQ and NET.

On September 3, 2021, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced that NEEQ will be reformed and **Beijing Stock Exchange** will be set up. The new Beijing Stock Exchange will be a part of the NEEQ, based on the former NEEQ Select Board.
