## History

Nile Bank was established in 1988 for the purposes of providing banking services to the public at a time when low cost banking was almost non-existent in Uganda.

The bank has around 90,000 customers and in January 2003, Nile Bank became one of the first Ugandan banks to receive ISO certification.

In June 2007 Nile Bank was purchased by Barclays bank. Barclays decided to merge the two client-bases and do an IT systems upgrade at the same time.
