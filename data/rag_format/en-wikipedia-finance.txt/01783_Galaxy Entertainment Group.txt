# Galaxy Entertainment Group



**Galaxy Entertainment Group** (**GEG**; Chinese: 銀河娛樂集團) is a company that owns and operates hotels and casinos in Macau through its subsidiary, Galaxy Casino S.A.


## History

The company, known formerly as K. Wah Construction Materials, disposed of its construction material business and became the only Hong Kong-listed company to hold an operating license in Macao in 2005 by acquiring a 97.9% stake in Galaxy Casino SA. The deal was described as akin to "a snake trying to swallow an elephant". Galaxy and Venetian Macao had originally planned to run their gaming license in Macao jointly, but the two had since split and decided to run their gaming business separately.

In February 2020 the company confirmed it had withdrawn from its bidding in Osaka and would instead focus on other licenses in Japan, including Yokohama among others. After its Macau casinos were closed that month for the COVID-19 outbreak as well as other casinos, the company said it would return to full capacity only after guest demand had increased.


## Properties

The company owns the following casinos and hotels in Macau:

* The StarWorld Macau (Macau Peninsula)
* CityClub casinos (Macau Peninsula)
 + Waldo Casino
 + President Casino
 + Rio Casino
* Broadway Casino (Cotai)
* The Galaxy Macau (Cotai)

## Business areas

The principal activities of Galaxy Entertainment and its subsidiaries are operation in casino games of chance or games of other forms, provision of hospitality and related services in Macau, and the manufacture, sale and distribution of construction materials in Hong Kong, Macau and Mainland China.

It operates in two segments: gaming and entertainment, and construction materials.
