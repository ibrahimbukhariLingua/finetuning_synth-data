Although sales were steady between 2007 and 2010 long term debt rose 98.6% over that period; Long term debt increased 44% in 2008 and remained near that level until January 2011 when it fell 17% quarter to quarter (then fell a further 3% by January 2012). No single customer contributes more than 10% of revenue.

The company has been recognized for innovations made in air filter technology (since 2008 annual spending on research and development has exceeded $40.6 million). It has also participated in technological advancements associated with fuel cells.


## Defense-related studies

Since the early Cold War years, the company's research division has continuously participated in government-funded research projects for various military applications. Its focus mainly being on advanced development of modularized, collective protection for military vehicles, vans and shelters, nuclear, biological and chemical protection, development of CBRN defense systems (primarily for detection and warning of chemically contaminated environment, air and/or surface decontamination equipment,) for combat vehicles and manpower in the field, intended for use with all military branches of the United States Armed Forces, air filtration systems for missile systems and space vehicles, M1 Abrams main battle tank turbine engines, and complex military equipment such as the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radars. Donaldson-developed chemical defensive material includes protective clothing and equipment to secure area and enclosures/compartments from chemical contamination, protect military personnel and individual soldiers from chemical agents; collective protection shelters for certain military headquarters and military communications functions, for rest and relief, and for certain vehicle crews; manual and automatic detection and warning devices that respond to toxic agents on all surfaces, in the atmosphere, and in food and water; means to decontaminate skin, clothing, equipment, terrain, food, and water.


## History

Started as **Donaldson Engineering**, a small business built around Frank Donaldson's air intake filter invention (engine air cleaner). Frank Donaldson invented the air intake filter while repairing a tractor in Utah. The business was incorporated in 1915 by Donaldson, his parents and his siblings as **Donaldson Company Inc**.

In its first decade, Donaldson Company made two important moves; it acquired the Wilcox-Bennet air filter license and introduced the Simplex, a filter that also prevents engine damage. Deere & Company was the company's most important client during the first couple decades. The early 1930s brought additional prosperity when William Lowther joined the company and designed the NS Filter, a tractor performance enhancing filter invented by Frank Donaldson. The 1930â€™s were a transitional period, beginning with tough economic conditions in the United States which caused business from farmers to fall and subsequently forcing the company to contract in size. This was later followed by the sale of patents to influential investors provided the company with funds and market exposure needed to survive and grow (part of the agreement was that Donaldson Company produce the filters). World War II provided opportunities for the company to expand into aerospace and military hydraulic equipment and device filters. The 1950s were bittersweet. While the company gained market share, grew in size and went public in 1955, it was beset by employee strikes, the exodus of key employees (who started a new company to compete with Donaldson for market share) and IRS charges of hidden back taxes.

In the 1960s subsidiaries were established in Germany, South Africa, Britain, France, Australia and Benelux.
