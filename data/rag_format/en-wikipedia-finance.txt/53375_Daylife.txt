It provided digital media management tools and content feeds to publishers, brand marketers and developers.

Daylife's products included the Daylife Publisher Suite, a range of APIs, and a set of "hosted solutions" including Smart Topics, Smart Galleries, and Smart Sections. The hosted solutions were all launched in partnership with Getty Images, which offers publishers a wide range of multimedia tools. Daylife's technology analyzed over 100,000 curated content feeds, which enabled publishers to curate and automate media for use in proprietary content.

The company shut down in 2016.
