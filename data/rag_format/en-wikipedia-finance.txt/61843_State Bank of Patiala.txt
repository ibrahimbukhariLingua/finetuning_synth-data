## History

His Highness Bhupinder Singh, Maharaja of Patiala State, founded the Patiala State Bank on 17 November 1917 to foster growth of agriculture, trade, and industry. The bank combined the functions of a commercial bank and those of a central bank for the princely state of Patiala. The bank had one branch at Chowk Fort, Patiala, Undivided India. By 1927, it had five branches. It primarily engaged in providing short-term credit to grain dealers and other traders.

The formation of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union in 1948 led to the bank being reorganized, being brought under the control of the Reserve Bank of India, and being renamed Bank of Patiala. In 1949, the Bank absorbed Bank of Faridkot and Jind Cooperative Bank, though it subsequently gave up the cooperative business. The two acquired banks had been operating in neighboring princely states.

In 1950, Bank of Patiala started opening offices outside Patiala and East Punjab States Union. In 1952 it established a branch at Delhi. By 1959 the bank had 48 offices.

On 1 April 1960 Bank of Patiala became a subsidiary of State Bank of India and was renamed State Bank of Patiala. In April it absorbed Kalsia State Bank.
