# DNB ASA



**DNB ASA** (formerly **DnB NOR ASA**) is Norway's largest financial services group, with total combined assets of more than NOK 1.9 trillion and a market capitalisation NOK 164 billion as of 20 May 2016. DNB's head office is located in Oslo.

The two largest owners of DNB are the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (34.0%) and Sparebankstiftelsen DNB (10.0%). The latter was created as a foundation with the sole purpose of owning a part of the company. It was created when Gjensidige NOR was made a public limited company to ensure that the company's customers retained partial ownership of the company. The foundation can also give up to 25% of its received dividend as gifts to charity.
