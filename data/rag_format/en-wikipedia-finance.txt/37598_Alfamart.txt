# Alfamart



**PT Sumber Alfaria Trijaya Tbk** or **Alfamart** is a primarily-franchised Indonesian convenience store chain. As of June 2023, it has over 18,000 stores in 27 provinces spread across Indonesia, with 4 million daily customers and tens of thousands of micro, small and medium-scale business partners. Alfamart also has about 2,000 outlets in the Philippines as of September 2024. The business was started in December 1989 as a trading and distribution company in Jakarta by its president, Djoko Susanto. Ten years later, Susanto ventured into the convenience store category with Alfa Minimart, with their first branch being in Karawaci, Tangerang, Banten. Later renamed as Alfamart, the convenience store brand has since expanded to the Philippines, with its first Philippine branch located in Trece Martires, Cavite.


## History

In 1989, Djoko Susanto and his family established a trading and distribution company that sold various products in Jakarta. The distribution company had a corporate share of 70% with Sampoerna and the remaining 30% were with Susanto's PT Sigmantara Alfaindo.

In 1999, Susanto ventured out into the convenience store business, branding it as Alfa Minimart. He opened his first branch at Jalan Beringin Raya, Karawaci, Tangerang, Banten. In the span of six years, Alfa Minimart grew to a total of 1,293 branches along Java. The chain's name was later rebranded as Alfamart.

In 2006, Sampoerna sold its shares to Susanto's Sigmantara Alfaindo. Susanto gained 60% of the company's shares, while the remaining 40% was granted to a new shareholder, PT Mulia Prima Horizons.

In 2009, Alfamart joined the Indonesia Stock Exchange with around 3,000 branches nationwide. The business was renamed as PT Sumber Alfaria Trijaya Tbk. Soon after, Alfamart brought the Lawson stores into Indonesia while expanding from being solely in the convenience store chain business, to the operation of supermarket stores with Alfamidi Mini Supermarkets.

In 2014, Alfamart had 7,000 branches in Indonesia catering to an average of 2.5 million customers daily. The company reported to have over 14,000 branches by the end of 2019.

After its success in Indonesia, Alfamart expanded into the neighboring country of the Philippines. Its entry into the Philippine market was made through a partnership with SM Investments Corporation, launching its first branch in Trece Martires, Cavite in June 2014. In 2020, Alfamart in the Philippines started expanding into the Visayas and Mindanao regions, particularly in Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga. On November 11, 2020, its 1000th Philippine store in Barangay Santiago, General Trias, Cavite was opened.

Now, the parent company of Alfamart, PT Sigmantara Alfindo or AlfaCorp, also owned the larger minimarket chain called **Alfamidi** which is operated by PT Midi Utama Indonesia Tbk, and **Alfa Express** which also serve coffee and fast food.
