Pharmaceutical compounding - the creation and dispensing of tailor-made medications - is the root of the pharmacy profession, often symbolised by the mortar and pestle. Compounding allows the pharmacist to work with the patient and the prescriber to customise medication to meet the patient’s specific needs. It regularly happens, for example, that patients need their medication in a dosage form or strength that is not available or that patients are allergic to an ingredient. In such situations, pharmaceutical compounding provides a tailor-made solution for the patient.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## History

Omega Pharma has been taking over smaller companies for a long time and has also set up several specialized divisions. This was part of the company's buy-and-build strategy. An important takeover was that of the Dutch company Fagron (van Ger van Jeveren) in 2000. Fagron was founded in 1990 by Ger van Jeveren and distributed raw materials for medicines. Arseus was founded in 2006 as an umbrella organization for 35 small companies (the first available annual report dates from 2007). Arseus formed the integration of the "professional healthcare division" (B2B) of Omega Pharma. Arseus went public in 2007 after a management buy-out. Omega Pharma then still retained 24% of the shares of Arseus.
