## History

Thomas Cook had many ventures including the invention of the world's package tour in 1841, the first pre-paid hotel coupon in 1868, creation of the first holiday brochure in 1858, and conceptualization of the first Travellers Cheques in 1874.

In 1881, Thomas Cook started its India operations in Bombay (later renamed Mumbai), and in October 1978, saw it christened Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. The company made its first public issue in February 1983, and commenced operations in Mauritius in 2000. In the same year, they acquired the Sri Lanka business from Thomas Cook Overseas Ltd, UK.

In 2006, Thomas Cook India Limited acquired LKP Forex Limited and Travel Corporation (India) Pvt. Ltd. (TCI).

In 2015, Thomas Cook Lanka Pvt. Ltd. (a subsidiary of Thomas Cook India Limited) acquired Luxe Asia Pvt.

In the same year, TCIL announced the acquisition of Kuoni Travel (India) Private Limited, a travel operator in India, and Kuoni Travel (China) Limited, a travel operator in Hong Kong.

In September 2017, Thomas Cook acquired Tata Capital's forex and travel business. In the aftermath of the collapse of Thomas Cook in the UK, the Indian namesake was considering rebranding itself to avoid the negative perception caused by the collapse of the UK travel company.
