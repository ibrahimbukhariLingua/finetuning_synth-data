# Verily



**Verily Life Sciences LLC**, also known as **Verily** (formerly **Google Life Sciences**), is Alphabet Inc.'s research organization devoted to the study of life sciences. The organization was formerly a division of Google X, until August 10, 2015, when Sergey Brin announced that the organization would become an independent subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. with restructuring completed on October 2, 2015. On December 7, 2015, Google Life Sciences was renamed Verily. As of 2025, Verily is the first “bet” to successfully divest from Google and is now operating as a standalone company under Alphabet.


## History

On 9 September 2014, the division acquired Lift Labs, the makers of Liftware.

Verily Life Sciences in January 2019 raised $1 billion in funding.

At the end of 2019, Verily sold its stake in robot-assisted surgery joint venture Verb Surgical to development partner Johnson & Johnson.

In August 2020, Verily announced that it is entering into the insurance market with the launch of Coefficient Insurance Company. The new subsidiary will be backed by Swiss Re Group's commercial insurance unit.

In September 2022, Verily announced longtime CEO Andy Conrad would step down as CEO in January 2023, to be replaced by Stephen Gillett who became CEO on January 3, 2023.

In January 2023, fifteen percent of Verily's workforce was laid off as part of a broader restructuring by parent company, Alphabet. *The Information* reported in August that Gillett had told employees they would stop relying on Alphabet on "a wide range of corporate services", signaling a potential spin-out as an independent company.

In June 2024, Verily decided to close its operations in Israel three years after opening a research and development center in the country. Verily staff in Israel are expected to leave by the third quarter of 2024. The company cited an effort to refocus its strategy on core products and projects as the reason for the closure.

In August 2024, Verily moved its headquarters from South San Francisco to Dallas citing significant investment and involvement in the Texas healthcare and technology sectors.
