₂) and soda ash (Na
₂CO
₃). Hydrogen is also produced in this industry in small amounts. The chlor-alkali industry inputs are mainly used in soaps and detergents, pulp and paper, textiles, aluminium processing industry for caustic soda and for soda ash in glass, silicate production etc apart from soaps and detergents.
