Institut québécois de planification financière


# Institut québécois de planification financière



The **Institute of Financial Planning** (formerly **Institut québécois de planification financière**, or **IQPF**) is the only organization in Quebec (Canada) authorized to grant the financial planning diploma which leads to the Financial Planner (F.Pl.) title.

In addition, the institute develops and delivers professional development activities for financial planners. Financial planners must accumulate professional development units in three categories:

* Integrated personal financial planning (IPFP)
* Training activities in one or more of the financial planning areas (SFPA)
* Training activities in subjects pertaining to compliance with standards, ethics and business conduct (SC), and training activities in subjects pertaining to compliance with standards, ethics and business conduct related directly to financial planning (SC-FP)

## Regulation of financial planners

In Quebec, under the article 57 of the "Loi sur la distribution des produits et services financiers" (Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services), only a person holding a diploma in financial planning issued by the Institute may obtain, from the Autorité des marchés financiers (Quebec) (AMF), a certificate authorizing the person to use the title of financial planner.

The Chambre de la sécurité financière (CSF) is responsible for financial planners' ethical obligations since 1998. Financial planners that are members of the Ordre des Administrateurs Agréés du Québec fall under their professional order's regulation, according to an agreement with the AMF.

## History of the Institute

* **1989** - The passing of the Act respecting market intermediaries, providing for the creation of a "Institut québécois de planification financière". The Institute was created in 1989 under the 3rd part of the Quebec Companies Act, following the coming into force of the Act respecting market intermediaries (RSQ c. I-15.1), passed on June 21, 1989, by the National Assembly of Quebec:

> "The Minister shall, before granting his accreditation to a Québec institute of financial planners, obtain the advice of the Inspector General.
> The accredited institute shall, by a by-law subject to the approval of the Government, determine the conditions governing the issuance of financial planner's diplomas, including those relating to equivalence, and the terms and conditions of payment of the contributions to be paid by the persons who use the title of financial planner."

* **1992** - The Institute holds its first official graduation ceremony.
* **1996** - The first "Certificate in personal financial planning" program begins in the autumn of 1996 at the University of Laval with 850 registrations. Today, a dozen or so institutions offer a program in personal financial planning approved by the Institute.
* **1996** - Publication of the first edition of "La Collection de l'IQPF", the reference work for financial planners.
* **1997** - The Institute develops the Competency profile of financial planners, which aims to define the financial planner's role, as well as the professional skills essential to the practice of financial planning.
* **1998**- The passing of the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (bill 188), which recognizes the Institute as the exclusive authority in granting the financial planning diploma and establishing the rules concerning the ongoing professional development of professional financial planners. Bill 188 comes into force in 1999.
* **1998**- The Institute partners up with five other organizations to hold the first Financial Planning Week. This annual event turned into the Mois de la planification financière de la retraite, organized by Question Retraite.
* **1999** - Professional development becomes mandatory for financial planners.
* **1999** - The Institute amends its regulation on the basic education of financial planners to make the bachelor's degree (or equivalent training) the standard for obtaining the financial planner diploma. This minimum standard came into force in 2002 for new registrants and in 2005 for those who were already enrolled in the training program leading to the title.
* **2001** - Approval by decree of the new regulation on the compulsory professional development of financial planners, which is administered by the Institute.

The Institute reports to the AMF when it comes to financial planners' compliance with professional development requirements.

Individual respondents are overwhelmingly in favor of the creation of a new order.
* **2008** - After a long study by the Advisory Committee, the Office des professions du Québec does not recommend the establishment of a professional order of financial planners, arguing that the current regulation framework is sufficient. Despite this outcome, the Institute continues to call for the creation of a professional order of financial planners.
