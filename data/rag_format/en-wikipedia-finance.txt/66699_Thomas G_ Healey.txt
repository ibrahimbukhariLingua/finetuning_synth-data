## Legacy

After Thomas Healey's death in 1897, his son William carried on the family businesses, which included the construction of the second Healey Building (1914, still standing) in the Fairlie-Poplar district of downtown Atlanta.

The William-Oliver Building was built on the site of the first Healey Building in 1930, and is named after Healey's two grandsons.
