## Antitrust lawsuit

In January 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed accusing Diamondback, along with seven other US oil and gas producers, of an illegal price-fixing scheme to constrain production of shale oil, allegedly leading to drivers in the US paying more for gasoline than they would have in a competitive market.
