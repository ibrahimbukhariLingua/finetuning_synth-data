After World War II and the Nationalization Law of June 1948, Societatea Națională de Credit Industrial was nationalized and became Banca de Credit pentru Investiții.

BRD was founded in 1990 as a commercial bank by taking over assets of the former Investment Bank of Romania.

Since 31 October 2012, the general manager of the BRD is Philippe Charles Lhotte. He replaced Alexandre Paul Maymat who stepped down due to family reasons.
