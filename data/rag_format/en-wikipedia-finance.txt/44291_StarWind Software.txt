## History

StarWind Software began in 2008 as a spin-off from Rocket Division Software, Ltd. (founded in 2003)ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, with a round Aᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ of investment from venture capital firm ABRT. It started providing early adopters with initially free software defined storage offerings in 2009, including its V2V (virtual-to-virtual) image converter and iSCSI SAN software.

In 2013, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital began integrating StarWind's iSCSI engine with some of the company's Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances.

In March 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported how the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was affecting technology firms with a significant presence in Ukraine, including StarWind. Once the invasion was imminent, the company helped its employees move out of the country, including relocating 60 of the 180 workers from its Kyiv, Ukraine office to Wroclaw, Poland. The company also reportedly doubled the salaries of employees who enlisted in the Ukrainian army.
