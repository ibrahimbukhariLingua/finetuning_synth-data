# Iqbal Quadir



**Iqbal Z. Quadir** (Bengali: ইকবাল জেড. কাদীর) is a Bangladeshi-American entrepreneur who has taught at the Harvard Kennedy School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is the brother of Bangladeshi-American entrepreneur and artist Kamal Quadir.

Between 1993 and 1997, Quadir founded Grameenphone in Bangladesh to provide universal access to telephone services and to increase self-employment opportunities for its rural population.

In 2007, he founded the Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship at MIT, of which he is now the director. One year prior, he co-founded *Innovations* (an MIT Press Journal), which he continues to edit.


## Early years

Quadir was born in Jessore, Bangladesh. He moved to the United States in 1976 and later became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He earned his Secondary School Certificate from Jhenidah Cadet College, Bangladesh.

Quadir received a B.S. honors from Swarthmore College (1981), an M.A. (1983), and an M.B.A. (1987) from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.


## Career

Quadir served as a consultant to the World Bank in Washington, D.C. (1983–1985), an associate at Coopers & Lybrand (1987–1989), an associate at Security Pacific Merchant Bank (1989–1991), and vice president of Atrium Capital Corporation (1991–1993).

From 1993 onward, Quadir changed his focus to his underlying aspiration: creating universal access to digital telephone service in Bangladesh and increasing self-employment opportunities for its rural poor. To that end, he founded the New York-based company Gonofone (Bengali for "phones for the masses"). To further his vision, he went on to organize a global consortium involving Telenor, Norway's leading telecommunications company; an affiliate of micro-credit pioneer Grameen Bank in Bangladesh (winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize); Marubeni Corp. in Japan; Asian Development Bank in the Philippines; Commonwealth Development Corp. in the United Kingdom; and International Finance Corp. and Gonofone in the United States. He attracted these investors by complementing his vision of connecting all of Bangladesh with a practical distribution scheme whereby village entrepreneurs, backed by micro-loans, could retail telephone services to their surrounding communities. In fact, Quadir coined the phrase "connectivity is productivity" to explain the unique impact of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), particularly mobile telephones, in improving economic efficiency.

The resulting company, Grameenphone, received a license for cell-phone operation in Bangladesh in November 1996; it started operations in March 1997. Currently, the largest telephone company in Bangladesh with about 55 million subscribers, Grameenphone generates revenues close to $2 billion annually. With infrastructure investments of more than $3 billion, the company is providing cellular coverage throughout Bangladesh. Grameenphone has been recognized for its approach to improving economic opportunity and connectivity in Bangladesh, contributing to access to telecommunications in rural areas. According to Economist Jeffrey Sachs, Grameenphone "opened the world’s eyes to expanding the use of modern telecommunications technologies in the world’s poorest places."

From 2001 to 2005, Quadir served as a Fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School and taught graduate-level courses of technology in developing countries. At the same time, he was also a Fellow at the Center for Business Innovation at Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (now Capgemini).

In 2005, Quadir moved to MIT. In 2007, he founded the Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship. The center is based on the belief that economic development and good governance in low-income countries emerge from entrepreneurship and forward-looking innovations that empower ordinary citizens. It supports promising entrepreneurs through a fellowship for MIT students who are committed to building and scaling ventures in the developing world. Quadir no longer leads the Legatum Center.

Quadir coined the phrase '*invisible leg'* to describe how technological innovations change economies in terms of the distribution of economic and political influence.

In an effort to apply his development approach to electricity production in Bangladesh—where 70% of the population does not have access to the national electricity grid—Quadir founded Emergence BioEnergy, Inc., in 2006. This project and another one (namely, removing arsenic from water) were featured in an article titled "Power to the people" in the March 9, 2006 issue of *The Economist*. In 2007, Emergence BioEnergy won a Wall Street Journal Asian Innovation Award. After a decade of working on the development of these projects, however, he became dissatisfied and shut down both of them.


## Current projects

Quadir and his brother Kamal cofounded bKash in Bangladesh in 2009. bKash, the country's leading mobile financial service, currently provides mobile banking and payment services to over 70 million subscribers.

In 2004, he and his siblings founded the Anwarul Quadir Foundation to promote innovations for Bangladesh. In 2006, the foundation established a $25,000 global essay competition, the Quadir Prize, through the Center for International Development at Harvard University. In October 2007, the foundation made its first award to two recipients. In April 2009, Stephen Honan was the winner of the second award. Mr. Honan developed an innovative way to extract arsenic from drinking water and soil.


## Recognition

In 1999, Quadir was elected Global Leader for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum based in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2006, he became the 12th recipient of the Science, Education and Economic Development (SEED) Award from the Rotary Club of Metropolitan Dhaka, for initiating universal telephone coverage to Bangladesh. He appeared on CNN and PBS and was profiled in feature articles in the Harvard Business Review (Bottom-Up Economics, Aug 2003, & Breakthrough Ideas for 2004, Feb 2004), Financial Times, The Economist, and The New York Times, and in several books. In Spring 2007, Wharton Alumni Magazine selected Quadir for its list of 125 Influential People and Ideas. In 2011, he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Swarthmore College and the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from Case Western Reserve University.
