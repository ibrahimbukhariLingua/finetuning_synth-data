## History and acquisitions

On June 28, 2018, Convergys and Synnex announced they had reached a definitive agreement in which Synnex would acquire Convergys for $2.43 billion in combined stock and cash, and integrate it with Concentrix.

On October 5, 2018, Convergys Corporation and Synnex announced that they had completed the merger.

On March 29, 2023, Concentrix announced the acquisition and merger of Concentrix and Webhelp in a transaction worth $4.8 billion.

## HMRC contract

In 2014, Concentrix won a £75 million contract from the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs, to review two million tax credit claims for fraud and incorrect tax credit awards. Tax credits are a form of UK social welfare benefit paid out to parents and workers on low incomes. In 2016, Concentrix was receiving heavy criticism from the cross-party parliamentary committee on welfare for incorrectly closing the claims of tens of thousands of claimants, leaving them without money for essentials. A government report disclosed that of 36,000 appeals against Concentrix, 87% were upheld. In September 2016, HMRC announced that it would not renew the contract, due to expire in 2017, although the Treasury has resisted calls for a full inquiry thus far. As a result of Concentrix's failings, thousands of claimants were also due to receive back-payments for incorrectly stopped claims. Processing the resultant case reviews cost HMRC £43 million.
