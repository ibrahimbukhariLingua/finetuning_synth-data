TSG Entertainment


# TSG Entertainment



**TSG Entertainment** (also known as **TSG**) is an American film finance company which was established in 2013, founded by Chip Seelig and based in New York City. TSG was established after the U.S. theatrical release of *Parental Guidance* to replace Dune Entertainment when Dune did not renew their deal with 20th Century Fox. Fox was looking for a new long term co-financing arrangement and made a deal with TSG Entertainment. TSG also has a co-financing agreement with Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group since 2022. TSG stands for parent company **The Seelig Group**. TSG's logo and vanity card depict a man with a bow shooting an arrow through a dozen axe heads, a reference to the feat performed by Odysseus in Book 21 of Homer's *Odyssey*.


## History

The financing entity was founded by former Dune partner Chip Seelig with majority funding from Magnetar Capital with additional funding from Seelig and others. Seelig had left Dune in May 2011 to launch a new funding company.

TSG was also looking for some ($300–400 million) debt financing from banks at this time. In November 2015, Bona Film Group, a Chinese film studio, invested $235 million in TSG.

Because of The Walt Disney Company’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox (sans certain units) on March 20, 2019, Disney inherited Fox's deal with TSG for 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Lawsuit

In 2023, TSG sued Disney, alleging breach of contract in the financing of 20th Century Fox films and their distribution to streaming platforms.
