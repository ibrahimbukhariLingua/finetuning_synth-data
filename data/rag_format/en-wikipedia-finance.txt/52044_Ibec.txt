# Ibec



**Ibec** is an Irish business representative lobbying organisation
and human resources services provider.

Ibec is directed and managed by a board, national council, and executive director team.


## History

Ibec is an orphan acronym dating from a 2016 rebranding of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC). IBEC was founded in 1993 by the merger of the Federation of Irish Employers (FIE) and the Confederation of Irish Industry (CII).

The FIE and CII had overlapping membership; the FIE dealt with labour relations and the CII with other matters including lobbying the government. The FIE's history begins with the foundation of the Dublin Employers' Federation by William Martin Murphy in 1911, which was incorporated in 1928 as Federated Employers Ltd, renamed the Federated Union of Employers (FUE) in 1942 when it absorbed groups outside its Dublin base, and finally renamed FIE in 1989. The CII began in 1932 in the Anglo-Irish trade war as the Federation of Irish Industries (FII), a group advocating protectionism. The name changed successively to "Federation of Saorstát Industries" in 1934; "Federation of Irish Manufacturers" (FIM) in 1938; "Federation of Irish Industries" again in 1958; and finally "Confederation of Irish Industry" in 1969.


## Structure

The CEO of Ibec is Danny McCoy who assumed the role in June 2009.

With over 270 employees, Ibec engages with stakeholders in Ireland and internationally through six regional offices (Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Donegal,) and a Brussels office, along with a network in the UK and US.
