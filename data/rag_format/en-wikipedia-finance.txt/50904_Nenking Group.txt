## Involvement in FC Sochaux-Montbelliard

In April 2020, Nenking Group officially became the owner of the Football Club Sochaux-Montbéliard, one of the founding members of the French League. "This sale to the group whose founding president is Mr. Zhong Naixiong comes in accordance with the agreements previously made with Ledus" and Frankie Yau become president.

At the time, the club's newly-appointed Executive Director General Samuel Laurent said Nenking Group chairman Zhong Naixiong wanted to restore the club's status as a top-tier team in "three or four years".

During the 2022/2023 season, the club faced financial difficulties and needed a capital injection from Nenking in order to remain in the French Ligue 2. In July 2023, Nenking announced that they wouldn't inject capital and the DNCG (the organization responsible for monitoring and overseeing the accounts of professional association football clubs in France) relegated Sochaux to National (French Football 3rd Division) due to their financial problems. The club now faces a potential Bankruptcy. As a result, the FC Sochaux-Montbelliard would lose its professional football club status and would be relegated to the 6th Division.

While Romain Peugeot, the great-grandson of the club's founder, had concluded an agreement for a takeover offer allowing the group to remain a 33% shareholder of FC Sochaux-Montbelliard, Nenking did not respect his commitment to pay the 4 million euros planned. The objective of the operation was to avoid the bankruptcy of the club and to allow it to return to the French Ligue 2 championship.

The club was founded nearly a century ago by French automobile company Peugeot and they won the top division league title in the 1934–35 and 1937–38 seasons, the French League Cup in 2004 and the Coupe de France, the country's premier knockout cup competition, in 2007.

The Nenking company sold FC Sochaux on 25 August after causing a chaotic management situation that almost led to the demise of a club that was almost a hundred years old.
