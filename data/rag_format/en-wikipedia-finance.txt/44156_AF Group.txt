# AF Group



The **AF Group ASA** (OSE: AFG) (Norwegian: *AF Gruppen*) is the third largest civil engineering and construction company in Norway. The company headquarters is located in Oslo. The AF Group is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.


## History

The AF Group was established in 1985. The company eventually went into the oil and gas sector and built the landfall tunnel from the Troll Field in 1991, among other projects. AF merged with Ragnar Evensen in 1997, one of Oslo's largest contractors, which doubled AF's revenues. The acquisition of real estate-company Odin in 1997 was the basis for the business area Property, and AF built up the business areas demolition and recycling in the years that followed. The company took on the demolition of Sola Refinery in Jæren in 2000, one of the largest demolition projects in Norway. AF eventually became one of Norway's biggest within demolition.

Today, the company is one of the largest providers of energy efficiency and renewable energy production. In 2013, Offshore was established as a separate business area, after several projects in the years before. The Offshore commitment was extended with maintenance and modification, as well as marine and rig services, and new contracts in the North Sea resulted in Environmental Base at Vats, a modern reception facility for decommissioned offshore installations.
