## History

Zagreb Holding was established in 2006, but the history of its services goes back to the second half of the 19th century, when the first utilities' companies were established in Zagreb. Condition of communal infrastructure is the most important indicator of development in any city, and Zagreb's state of communal affairs shows that the city is part of European capitals for more than 100 years.

First Zagreb's utilities' company that was established was Plinara - in 1862. Other of Zagreb's utilities' companies were established in the first half of the 20th century. Rapid growth of the city and the city infrastructure, as well as a rapid rise in population, forced city administration to establish other utilities' and communal companies.

Zagreb Holding, established in 2006, was in charge of expanding and improvement of communal and utilities services. At the time, it was known as Gradsko komunalno gospodarstvo d.o.o. In 2007 the company changes its name into Zagreb Holding ltd.
