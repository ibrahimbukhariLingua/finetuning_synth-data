Cheyette model


# Cheyette model



In mathematical finance, the **Cheyette Model** is a quasi-Gaussian, quadratic volatility model of interest rates intended to overcome certain limitations of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework.
By imposing a special time dependent structure on the forward rate volatility function, the Cheyette approach allows for dynamics which are Markovian, in contrast to the general HJM model.
This in turn allows the application of standard econometric valuation concepts.
