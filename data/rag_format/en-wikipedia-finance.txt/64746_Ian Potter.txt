# Ian Potter



**Sir William Ian Potter** (25 August 1902 – 24 October 1994), known as **Ian Potter**, was an Australian stockbroker, businessman and philanthropist. Potter was knighted in 1962. The **Ian Potter Foundation**, which he established in 1964, has made grants to research institutes, charities, universities and arts organisations. Since 1993, the **Ian Potter Cultural Trust** has awarded grants to individuals in the arts.


## Early life and education

Potter was the third child of James W. Potter and Maria Louisa Townsend McWhinnie, who was born in Glasgow in June 1869. Potter's parents married in Sydney, in June 1899, then returned to England in 1903 with their three children. Returning to Sydney, he attended Mortdale Public School before winning a scholarship to Cleveland Street Intermediate High School in Redfern.

Potter served as a lieutenant with the Australian Army's Citizens Military Forces (CMF) between 1920 and 1922.

He studied economics at the University of Sydney, where he excelled and graduated at the top of his year.


## Career

Upon graduation, Potter moved to Melbourne to take on a position as economist with stockbroker Edward Dyason, a successful mining entrepreneur and trained economist. In 1933, Potter began an eighteen-month period as a Treasury economist in Canberra providing him with an intimate knowledge of government finance. He also made many contacts in politics and the federal bureaucracy.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### World War II

Potter continued his business interests during the war while training for, and serving in, the Naval Auxiliary Patrol (NAP). Like many small motor vessel owners, Potter volunteered his own boat, the MV *Nordecia*, to the NAP. *Nordecia* was later commissioned as HMAS *Nordecia*, carrying the bow number 624. *Nordecia* was fitted with a machine gun and depth charges. Enlisting on 17 August 1942, Potter trained as a Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RANVR) cadet. He was commissioned as a Staff Skipper with substantive rank of Sub Lieutenant on 8 May 1944, and stationed at HMAS Lonsdale, Port Melbourne, until his discharge on 31 May 1946. Following the war, the members of the NAP established the Little Ship Club to maintain the skills acquired during their service. In 1949, King George VI approved warrants for the award by the Royal Navy of the Blue Ensign (Defaced) to the Little Ship Club, and to Potter's HMAS *Nordecia* as well as the *San Vittoria* and *Mauranne*, for service during the war. This is the only award of the Blue Ensign (Defaced) to an Australian boat club for wartime service. The Blue Ensign (Defaced) included a light blue coloured circle representing the dawn, within which a five-pointed star represents the guiding star of their overnight patrols around Port Philip Bay.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Ian Potter Foundation and Cultural Trust

The Ian Potter Foundation was established by Potter in 1964, inspired by the Myer Foundation, as he was friends with Ken Myer, eldest son of Sidney Myer. That partnership also led to the establishment of the Howard Florey Institute at the University of Melbourne. Potter's vision was to support youth, and as of 2022 the foundation awards over A$20 million in grants annually, across a range of sectors. It adopted the seahorse as its logo.

The Ian Potter Cultural Trust came about after the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust was placed in liquidation in 1991. The foundation had previously been able to support individual artists by supporting this organisation, but its tax status prevented it from giving grants directly to individuals. In October 1992 the Ian Potter Cultural Trust was established, specifically to give grants to individual artists. The first grants were approved in June 1993.


## Personal life

Potter married four times. On 5 April 1928 he wed Victoria Bernice Moorhead in Mosman Presbyterian Church. He divorced his first wife in 1941 and on 2 July 1942 he married Gwenyth Winifred Izzard, an amateur actress, at the Cairns Memorial Presbyterian Church in East Melbourne. He divorced his second wife on the grounds of desertion. On 5 February 1955 he wed Patricia Ann Garvan (née Fitzgerald). This marriage also ended in divorce. On 27 March 1975 he married Primrose Catherine Dunlop (née Anderson Stuart) in the Chapel of St George the Martyr HMAS Watson at South Head, Vaucluse, New South Wales.

On his death his fourth wife and a daughter from each of his first and second marriages survived him.
