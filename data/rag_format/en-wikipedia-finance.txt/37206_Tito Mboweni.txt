## Minister of Finance, 2018–2021

On 9 October 2018, Mboweni was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa as the new Minister of Finance of the Republic of South Africa with immediate effect following Nhlanhla Nene's resignation. From the beginning of his tenure Mboweni often found himself at odds with the ruling ANC policy and ideology. The ruling ANC has always inclined itself towards socialist policies, a stance which has been viewed as a form of appeasing its alliance partners, the South African Communist Party and COSATU. On the other hand, Mboweni continuously proffered liberal solutions such as his 2019 economic recovery growth plan which was rejected by SACP and COSATU.

His economic growth plan was widely criticised in the Public Sector. In an opinion piece, Telkom Group CEO Sipho Maseko slammed Mboweni's proposed reforms for the ICT sector, particularly plans related to the rollout of spectrum, as being "ill-thought-out". However the response was different in the private sector, CEO of Bridgement Daniel Goldberg during his Sage tour to Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban hailed the plan, saying "it will improve the rate at which big state owned enterprises pays its suppliers consequently increasing efficiency in the economy. Phumlani Majozi in his opinion piece on Finance 24 argued that "Mboweni's ideas on how to revamp this economy, presented in his recent paper, titled "Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa", are what will get this country back on track."

In June 2020, Mboweni proposed a new austerity policy, to cut the state's wage bill of R160.2 billion over three years and to adopt a Zero-based budget system in order to avoid a sovereign debt crisis in 2024.

On 5 August 2021, Mboweni resigned as finance minister. He was succeeded in the post by Enoch Godongwana.

## Controversy

In January 2020, Mboweni became the first member of a South African cabinet since the end of apartheid to propose that South Africa and Lesotho be united as a federal state. Reactions to this proposal in both countries were partly negative and partly positive.

In August 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa "strongly reprimanded" Mboweni over comments he made on Twitter about the dismissal of the Bank of Zambia’s governor Denny Kalyalya. In a statement, the presidency explained that "in one of his tweets, Minister Mboweni is promising to mobilise if not given reasons why the Central (bank) Governor has been fired," citing the need for central bank independence.
