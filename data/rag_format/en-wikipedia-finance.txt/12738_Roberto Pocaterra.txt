## Political career

During Venezuela's first democratic government, his uncle, Julio Pocaterra, was one of President Rómulo Betancourt's closest confidants and convinced him to make his son his personal secretary. From then on, he developed his entire political career under the colors of Democratic Action (Venezuela).

In 1976, was designed as acting Ministry of Development under the first government of Carlos Andrés Pérez.

On February 27, 1988, he was appointed president of the Banco Industrial de Venezuela -a position he held until 1990- where he was in charge of reforming the institution's organizational structure to adapt to the needs of a country that was coming out of a major economic recession that led to El Caracazo. When he assumed the presidency, the institution's inherited liabilities amounted to almost US$3.6 billion from a debt restructuring that had been carried out in 1983. The new decisions made under his presidency allowed for the reactivation of many construction and infrastructure projects that were being developed in the eastern part of the country, mainly on Margarita Island, where they came to concentrate 75% of the credit portfolio in construction projects.

In 1989, he proposed to Congress the modification of the Income tax Law and the creation of the Value-added tax (VAT), which were approved two years later.

That same year, he was appointed Chief executive officer by the annual assembly of L-Bank, a cooperation system between European and Latin American private banks, made up of 22 commercial banks.

Between 1990 and 1992, during Carlos Andrés Pérez's second term, he held the position of Ministry of Finance. As part of his management, in 1991 he negotiated a US$19.7 million international financing from foreign banks for Venezuela and the modernization of the customs system at the country's airports, mainly the Simón Bolívar International Airport.

In 1993, he internally contested within Accion Democratica the possibility of being a candidate for mayor of Caracas, but the party opted for Claudio Fermín who ultimately lost the election to Aristóbulo Isturiz.
