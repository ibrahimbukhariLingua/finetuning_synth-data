## Sectors


### Digital economy

BharatNet roll out is already complete in Haryana by November 2017 by providing impetus to Make in India and Digital India. Gurgaon is among India's top 3 IT hubs and IT export income earner. Gurgaon shares its boundary with south Delhi making it a strategically located city. To be precise, it is located about 30km south of national capital New Delhi. It is one of the four major cities of the National Capital Region. It is the second largest city in Haryana. It has the third largest capital income in India after Chandigarh and Mumbai. It is also called the Millennium City with its vast array of modern commercial malls, cyber parks, hi-tech offices and plush residential spaces. The area of Gurugram city is 231 square km and it is divided into 35 municipal wards. Administratively, it comprises three subdivisions Gurugram South, Gurugram North, Pataudi and five Tehsils – Gurgaon, Sohna, Farrukhnagar, Pataudi and Manesar. It has 38 villages in its fold.
In the last two decades, Gurgaon has become the industrial and financial nerve centre of Haryana. It houses over 250 of the 500 Fortune 500 companies.
Gurugram is famous for its outsourcing and off-shore services that contribute most to its economy. Among the major industries in Gurugram, IT, ITES, auto manufacturing and pharmaceuticals have a considerable existence.
Professionals from across India come to Gurugram in search of jobs in the private sector. People find the city amicable for staying as there are apartments, housing societies, residential colonies and independent homes, where accommodation is available at affordable rates. Almost 60 per cent of Haryana’s revenue accrues from Gurugram by way of excise duty, sales tax, stamp duty and registration.
Gurgaon’s population has increased from some 870,539 in census 2001 to 1,514,085 in census 2011, an increase of 74 per cent in the decade in reference. As per official sources, the current population of Gurgaon is estimated to be close to 2.5 million. The population is expected to grow to 4.25 million by 2031, as per Gurugram Master Plan 2031.

Rapid growth has put substantial pressure on city’s resources. Infrastructural bottlenecks including traffic snarls, road congestions, water scarcity and pollution are on the rise.
Gurugram is still far away from being an efficient, sustainable, smart city that conserves costs, water, and energy and uses technology to coordinate various city services. Progressive cities across the world are rapidly adopting measures and technologies that will help them to become more sustainable.
One of the issues with Modafinil 200 mg has been that it has been run by multiple authorities with somewhat superimposing roles. There is Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Haryana Urban Development Authority, Haryana State Industrial & Infrastructural Development Corporation, Department of Town and Country Planning, Deputy Commissioner’s Office, to name a few.

The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has been proposed to be set up for better governance. A draft bill for its establishment was put in public domain in November 2016. The GMDA is proposed to be established in 2017.
The total exports from district Gurgaon in Information Technology and IT-enabled services industry has touched Rs 18,000 crore at the end of FY'08.
