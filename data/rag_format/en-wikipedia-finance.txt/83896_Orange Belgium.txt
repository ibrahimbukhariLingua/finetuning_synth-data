# Orange Belgium



**Orange Belgium** (known as **Orange**) is a Belgian telecommunications company. It competes with Proximus and Base.

It was incorporated by France Télécom in 1996 under the name of Mobistar. The company re-branded as Orange on 9 May 2016 (following its parent company's own change of name in 2013).


## History

Mobistar, today Orange Belgium, was founded in 1996 as a joint venture between Telinfo and France Télécom (now Orange S.A.), building a GSM 900 network and then founding a complementary DCS 1800 network.

Initially Mobistar added to its network coverage by signing contracts with providers such as Motorola & Talkline, Cellway, a subsidiary of Martin Dawes Telecommunications and Debitel Belgium, the latter two which it would take over respectively in 1997 and 2000.

Mobistar claims to have been the first GPRS operator in Belgium.

In May 2007 Mobistar bought 90% of the shares of VOXmobile (today: Orange Communications Luxembourg S.A.), a mobile phone company of Luxembourg. VOXmobile was rebranded as Orange on 28 October 2009.

In October 2010 Mobistar launched a €55/month hybrid satellite/internet TV package, Starpack to provide phone customers with multichannel TV. Mobistar TV combines DTH satellite TV with ADSL Internet to provide over 500 satellite TV and radio channels, along with interactive services, catch-up TV and content-on-demand via the Internet, and programme recording management via a smartphone. The satellite TV package includes Flemish national channels, HD and 3D channels, and a range of European free-to-air channels, all transmitted from Astra satellites. Mobistar has announced that this service will end on September 15, 2013.

In May 2016 Mobistar was rebranded in Orange Belgium. The company became a convergent operator with the launch of its TV and internet offer based on the cable technology a few months earlier.
