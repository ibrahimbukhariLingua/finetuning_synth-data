Metallurgy of Russia


# Metallurgy of Russia



The **metallurgy** industries of Russia make up about 5% of Russia's GDP, about 18% of industrial production and about 14% of exports, as of 2009. The volume of metallurgical production was 1.87 trillion rubles (2009). Investments in fixed assets in metallurgy were 280 billion rubles (2008). The average salary in the metallurgical industry was 23,258 rubles / month (March 2010).


## Ferrous

The share of ferrous metallurgy in the volume of industrial production in Russia is about 10%. The steel industry includes more than 1.5 thousand enterprises and organizations, 70% of them city-forming, and more than 660 thousand employees.
As of 2008, Russia ranked 4th in the world steel production (72 million tons per year). As of 2007, Russia takes third place in the world (after China and Japan) in exportation of steel products (27.6 million tons per year).

As of January 1, 2007, the production capacity of finished rolled steel in Russia amounted to 67.9 million tons. From 2000 to 2008, steel making capacity increased by 6.7 million tons, production of finished rolled steel by 4.3 million tons, and the production of steel pipes by 780 thousand tons.

More than 80% of industrial production of Russian ferrous metallurgy accounted for 9 large companies : Evraz, Severstal, NLMK, Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (MMK), MC metalloinvest, Mechel, TMK, United Metallurgical Company, Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling Plant.

The volume of basic iron and steel production in 2006 exceeded that from the early 1990s. From 2000 to 2007, the growth in output of steel and alloys was due to accelerated development of modern advanced techniques, in particular: electric furnace steelmaking. In 2007, production of rolled ferrous metals amounted to 59.6 million tons.

## Public policy

In recent years, the Russian government has taken measures to protect the domestic market, abolished import duties on the main types of equipment, supported by Russian firms buying metals assets abroad, has taken steps to reduce trade restrictions on foreign markets, acting against Russian steel products. These measures have contributed to the positive results of the activities of the Russian metallurgy in the 2000s.

In March 2009, Russia was approved by the Ministry of Industry Development Strategy for the metallurgical industry of the Russian Federation until 2020.
