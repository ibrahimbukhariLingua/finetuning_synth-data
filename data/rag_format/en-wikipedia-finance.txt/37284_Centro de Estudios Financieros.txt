# Centro de Estudios Financieros



The **Centro de Estudios Financieros** (**CEF**) is a business school in Spain, founded in 1977 and specializing in preparation for public administration examinations. It is part of the Grupo CEF-Universidad a Distancia de Madrid (UDIMA). It is headquartered in Madrid with centers in Barcelona, Valencia, and the Dominican Republic.


## History

The Centro de Estudios Financieros was founded in 1977 by economist Roque de las Heras to prepare students for public administration examinations for the Tax Agency. In 1978, training was extended to other areas of the State Administration. The Editorial Estudios Financieros was then created. In 1979, distance education was initiated.

In 1985, the institution began preparing students for regional administration examinations and in 1998 for European Union examinations.

Since 1984, postgraduate courses in fiscal matters have been offered, later extending specialized education to other areas of economic, legal, and digital training. In 1986, the Centro de Estudios Financieros opened in Barcelona; in 1987, a second center in Madrid; in 1997, the Valencia center; and in 2019, a center in the Dominican Republic.

In 1990, the Centro de Estudios Financieros established the Premio Estudios FinancierosÂ [es] (Financial Studies Award), which has since recognized research and creative work in the business world.

In 2006, the group CEF established the Universidad a Distancia de Madrid (UDIMA). The CEF-UDIMA group has incorporated various digital methodologies into teaching and management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to study plans for the labor market integration of students.
