**Michael Pero** (born 26 February 1960) is a New Zealand businessman and entrepreneur.


## Professional history

Pero founded his mortgage broking business in 1991. In 2011, Pero established a real estate company under the same brand name.

In recent surveys, Colmar Brunton reported that the Pero brand awareness was significantly higher than all other mortgage brokers and most people surveyed considered Mike Pero Mortgages to be New Zealand's most trusted mortgage adviser.

In 1999 and 2003, Pero won the New Zealand Pacific Business Award for categories Business of the Year,
and Business Person of the Year.

In 2003, Mike Pero Mortgages was named the Westpac Franchise of the Year. In 2014, Mike Pero Real Estate was ranked 23rd in the Deloitte Fast 50 with 327.8% growth, which placed it 6th in the category of ‘Retail or consumer product’.

Pero was a founding member of the NZ Mortgage Brokers Association and recognised for his services to the Mortgage Broking Industry of New Zealand – he was the first recipient of the Geoff Chong Memorial Trophy in 2005.

Mike Pero Real Estate is represented across New Zealand by 60 (approx.) offices located from Invercargill to the far north and over 200 licensed real estate agents.

As a community focused company, Mike Pero Real Estate formed the Mike Pero Foundation in 2014. Since then they have helped to raise funds of over $500,000 for the local community.

In February 2017 Pero opened what he believes to be New Zealand's first permanent public display of classic Japanese motorcycles. Mike Pero's Motorcycle Gallery displays more than 60 motorcycles from the 70s, 80s and 90s – loaned from owners and collectors nationwide. Pero hopes that the gallery gives the general public an opportunity to appreciate some classic machines they haven't seen before or have wanted to see again.

In July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic Pero announced plans for a new airline, Pasifika Air, connecting Christchurch and Rarotonga. In June 2021, it was announced that the plans for the airline have been abandoned.
