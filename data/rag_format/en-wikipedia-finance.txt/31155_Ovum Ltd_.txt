## History

Ovum was created in 1982 by Tim Johnson, a remote working technology journalist at *The Sunday Times* in London. In 1985, Johnson was joined by four ex-colleagues from Logica (Ron Sasson, David Lewin, Richard Kee and Jules Hewett) and moved into its first office in central London. From this point, it grew rapidly in the telecoms and software sectors, enjoying 16 years of uninterrupted growth, and opening several offices around the world. Jules Hewett was Ovum's longest serving Chief Executive, from 1988 to 1990 and from 1994 to 2001. In 2000, Ovum achieved revenues of £19 million, and made its first acquisition, Richard Holway Limited.

Chris Dines, previously Finance Director, took over as Chief Executive in 2001. Ovum suffered during the tech crash of the early 2000s, but had recovered by the mid-2000s and was able to float on the London Stock Exchange's AIM in March 2006[2].
