Previously, it has received $19 million in Series B round in 2018 and $5.5 million in Series A round in 2017.

In 2019, Zum entered in a $150 million contract with San Francisco Unified Schools District to operate the transportation system in the district.

In February 2020, Zum began a partnership with Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) to provide transportation services to its students. In August 2024, OUSD introduced the first all-electric school bus fleet in the United States.

In October 2021, Zum, nearing unicorn status, received $130 million in funding led by Softbank Vision Fund 2, with participation from existing investors including Sequoia and BMW i Ventures. The funds were used to expand the company's footprint to new areas and expand its fleet, including adding new electric vehicles.
