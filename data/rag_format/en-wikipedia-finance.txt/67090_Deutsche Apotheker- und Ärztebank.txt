## History

In 1902 the *Kredit-Verein Deutscher Apotheker* (KREDA; credit union of German pharmacists) was founded in Danzig by 18 pharmacists. In 1938 it was renamed *Deutsche Apothekerbank e.G.m.b.H.* and in 1939 it merged with the *Spar- und Kreditverein Deutscher Apotheker m.b.H.* After the bank was closed in 1945, it was re-established in 1948 as *Westdeutsche Apothekerbank e.G.m.b.H.* in Düsseldorf. For years the bank has been the biggest German cooperative bank according to total assets.


## Annual financial statements

The financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 led to a massive slump of the net income. After no dividend was distributed for the fiscal year 2009 the Apobank paid a dividend of 4% for the fiscal years 2010 to 2016.


## Awards

The Deutsche Aptheker- und Ärztebank awards the Karl-Winter-Medal.
