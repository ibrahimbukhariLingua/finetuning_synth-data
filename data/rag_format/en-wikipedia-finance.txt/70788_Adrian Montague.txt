## Early life

Montague was born in February 1948. He earned a master of arts degree from Trinity Hall, Cambridge.


## Career

Montague began his career as a solicitor for Linklaters & Paines, where he worked from 1971 to 1994. He worked for the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort from 1994 to 1997.

He was the chairman of British Energy from 2002 to 2009.

In 2008, when Montague was chairman of the insurance company Friends Provident, he turned down an offer from the private equity firm J.C. Flowers to take over the company for 150p a share, only to see Clive Cowdery's Resolution buy it 12 months later for a mere 79p a share.

In June 2023, Montague was appointed as chair of the Board at Thames Water and its parent company Kemble Water. His appointment came amid scrutiny on the financial stability of the water company.
