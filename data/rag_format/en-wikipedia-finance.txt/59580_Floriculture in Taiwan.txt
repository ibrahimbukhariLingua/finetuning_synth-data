Tianwei is a traditional center of the industry and is known as the “land of flowers."


## History

The high-end orchid industry began in the 1970s with amateurs and hobbyists collecting and cultivating specimens. Due to the economic expansion of Taiwan’s economy during this period these hobbyists where able to devote significant resources to developing and crossbreeding orchids. This created a dedicated local market for very expensive innovative flowers. In the 1980s major Taiwanese corporations noticed the market and began mass production with the help of Dutch companies and cultivation techniques.

In the early 1990s Taiwanese flower producers played an important part in starting the modern floriculture industry in China, particularly around Kunming.

In 2005 Taiwan overtook Thailand as the world’s top orchid producer.

The export oriented flower market suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic with an increase in domestic consumption and government support necessary to keep the industry profitable.

In 2022 Taiwan was by far the largest exporter of orchids to the United States.
