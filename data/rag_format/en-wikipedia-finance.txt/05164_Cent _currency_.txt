Cent (currency)


# Cent (currency)



The **cent** is a monetary unit of many national currencies that equals a hundredth (1⁄100) of the basic monetary unit. The word derives from the Latin *centum*, 'hundred'.

The **cent sign** is commonly a simple minuscule (lower case) letter c. In North America, the c is crossed by a diagonal or vertical stroke (depending on typeface), yielding the character ¢.

The United States one cent coin is generally known by the nickname "penny", alluding to the British coin and unit of that name. Australia ended production of their 1c coin in 1990, New Zealand last produced their 1c coin in 1988, as did Canada in 2012. Some Eurozone countries ended production of the 1 euro cent coin, most recently Slovakia in 2022.


## Symbol

The cent may be represented by the cent sign, written in various ways according to the national convention and font choice. Most commonly seen forms are a minuscule letter *c* crossed by a diagonal stroke, a vertical line, a simple *c*, depending on the currency (*see below*). Cent amounts from 1 to 99 can be represented as one or two digits followed by the appropriate abbreviation (2¢, 5c, 75¢, 99c), or as a subdivision of the base unit ($0.75, €0.99). In some countries, longer abbreviations like "ct." are used. Languages that use other alphabets have their own abbreviations and conventions.

The cent symbol has largely fallen into disuse since the mid-20th century as inflation has resulted in very few things being priced in cents in any currency. It was included on US typewriter keyboards, but has not been adopted on computers.


### North American cent sign

The cent sign appeared as the shift of the 6 keys on American manual typewriters, but the freestanding circumflex on computer keyboards has taken over that position. The character (offset 162) can still be created in most common code pages, including Unicode and Windows-1252:

* On DOS- or Windows-based computers with a numeric keypad, `Alt` can be held while typing `0``1``6``2` or `1``5``5` on the keypad. See Unicode input § In Microsoft Windows for techniques involving the hexadecimal code point `A2` that can be used when there is no numeric keypad, as on many laptops. For the US International keyboard `Right Alt``⇧ Shift``C` can be typed.
* On Mac systems, `⌥ Option` can be held and `4` on the number row pressed.
* On Unix/Linux systems with a compose key, `Compose`+`|`+`C` and `Compose`+`/`+`C` are typical sequences.

### Orthography

When written in English and Mexican Spanish, the cent sign (¢ or c) follows the amount (with no space between)—for example, 2¢ and $0.02, or 2c and €0.02. Conventions in other languages may vary.
