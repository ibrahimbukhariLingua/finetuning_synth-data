## Overview

Value migration as a concept is a flow of economic value from outmoded, obsolete businesses towards the others with superior business designs. The latter ones are better positioned to create utility and comfort for customers. In this book, the author describes the skills that managers and owners need to identify and to capture these value shifts. He posits that the change in a business landscape is, in fact, inevitable and identifies seven patterns of value migration that managers should know.
