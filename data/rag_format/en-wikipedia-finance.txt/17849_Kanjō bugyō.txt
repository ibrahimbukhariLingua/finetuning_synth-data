Kanjō bugyō


# Kanjō bugyō



***Kanjō-bugyō*** (勘定奉行) were officials of the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo period Japan. Appointments to this prominent office were usually *fudai daimyōs*. Conventional interpretations have construed these Japanese titles as "commissioner" or "overseer" or "governor".

The work was mainly done at the account office.

This *bakufu* title identifies an official with responsibility for finance. The office of *kanjō-bugyō* was created in 1787 to upgrade the status and authority of the pre-1787 finance chief (*kanjō-gashira*).

It was a high-ranking office, in status roughly equivalent to a *gaikoku-bugyō*; the status of this office ranked slightly below that of *daimyō*, ranking a little below the *machi-bugyō*. The number of *kanjō bugyō* varied, usually five or six in the late Tokugawa period.

The *kanjō-bugyō* was considered to rank approximately with the *gunkan-bugyō*. The *kanjō-ginmiyaku* were *bakufu* officials of lower rank who were subordinate to the *kanjō-bugyō*.


## Clans

There are also accounts in various Domains, and like the accounts of the shogunate, they were in charge of duties such as finance and tax collection of the domains. The chief executive officer of the Accounts Office is the Kanjo Bugyo, and because of the domain's financial responsibilities, a superior with a relatively upper class samurai was appointed within the clan . In addition, there was an official of the accountant under the Kanjō bugyō, who was in charge of the duties.
