## History

Aktia originated from the oldest deposit bank in Finland, founded in 1825 as *Helsingfors Stads Sparbanks Inrättning*. In 1891 the bank changed its name to *Helsingfors Sparbank* (Helsinki Savings Bank).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Some banks that have merged with Aktia include: *Kirkkonummen Säästöpankki* in 1956, *Säästöpankki Torkkeli* in 1979 and *Espoon Säästöpankki* in 1980.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Aktia attained its current form in 1991, when the savings bank of Bromarv, Hanko, Ingå, Karjaa-Pohja, Sipoo, Siuntio, and Tenala merged to form *Säästöpankki Aktia* (Savings Bank Aktia). Later, the savings banks of Porvoo and Vaasa were merged. The name was changed to *Aktia Säästöpankki Oy* (Aktia Savings Bank Oy) in 1994. In 1996, Aktia acquired the retail banking operations of SKOP Bank (fi), which went bust in the early-1990s Finnish banking crisis and the recession that followed.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Annual General Meeting in the spring of 2018 decided to merge Aktia's share series: previously the shares were divided into A and R series, of which each R share entitles the holder to 20 votes and each A share to one vote at the Annual General Meeting.
