McCoy College of Business


# McCoy College of Business



The **McCoy College of Business** is the business school of Texas State University. The college offers curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate students and receives its business accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.

Established in 1968, Texas State's business school was originally known as the College of Business Administration. Following a $20 million gift from local businessman and wife Emmett and Miriam McCoy in 2004, the school was formally renamed the Emmett and Miriam McCoy College of Business Administration. The endowment, now administered by the McCoy College of Business Development Foundation, provides distinguished professorships, scholarships to both undergraduates and graduates, and program development. Later, the McCoys were awarded honorary doctorates, being the seventh and eighth individuals receiving such awards from Texas State University.

The College contains five departments: Accounting; Computer information systems and QMST; Marketing; Management; Finance and Economics.

## McCoy Hall

McCoy Hall finished construction and was dedicated in 2006. Funding for the facility was achieved primarily through the McCoy's generous $20 million donation, thus coining the name for the building.


### Trading Lab

The **T. Paul Bulmahn Research and Trading Lab** is housed on the third floor of McCoy Hall. Funded through a $1.5 million donation made by ATP Oil & Gas Corp Chairman and President T. Paul Bulmahn, the lab allows students to trade in a "real world" environment.

The facility includes 30 dual-monitor workstations, eight Bloomberg Terminals, and several large LCD displays showing current financial market information, headlines, lab hours and other announcements. A 90-foot (27 m) LED ticker also rests outside the entrance showing current headlines and financial market activity.
