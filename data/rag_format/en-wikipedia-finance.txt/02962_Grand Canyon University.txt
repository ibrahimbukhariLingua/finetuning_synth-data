Grand Canyon University


# Grand Canyon University



**Grand Canyon University** (**GCU**) is a private for-profit Christian university in Phoenix, Arizona. The university offers degrees in over 200 areas of study and is administratively divided into 9 colleges. As of September 2023, more than 100,000 students were enrolled online and in person, making it one of the largest Christian universities by enrollment.

Although the U.S. Department of Education categorizes GCU as a for-profit school, the IRS classifies it as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation and the regional accreditation body, the Higher Learning Commission, classifies it as nonprofit. As of November 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, a court has ordered the Education Department to re-evaluate its classification using a different standard.

The Arizona Southern Baptist Convention established the institution in 1949 as Grand Canyon College. During the 1999–2000 academic year, the university ended its affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention.

The university competes as the Grand Canyon Antelopes in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Western Athletic Conference.


## History


### Founding

**Grand Canyon College** was founded as a nonprofit institution in 1949 in Prescott, Arizona. Southern Baptists felt the need to establish a faith-based institution that would allow local Baptists to obtain a bachelor's or master's degree without going east to a Baptist college in Texas or Oklahoma.

On October 8, 1951, Grand Canyon College relocated to its current location in Phoenix.

In 1984, the college's trustees voted to transition the college to a university for the school's 40th anniversary in 1989, becoming **Grand Canyon University**. At this time, it also changed governance from the Southern Baptist Convention to the GCU Board of Trustees.


### For-profit restructuring

Suffering financial and other difficulties in the early 21st century, the school's trustees authorized its sale in 2004 to California-based Significant Education, LLC, making it the first for-profit Christian college in the United States. Significant Education was a subsidiary of education entrepreneur Michael K. Clifford's company. Clifford became managing director of the privatized institution, with the former board of trustees serving in an advisory role. Significant Education became a corporation in 2005, publicly traded under the name Grand Canyon Education, Inc in 2008. GCE trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "LOPE".

After the infusion of capital, Grand Canyon University's size increased. After having fewer than 1,000 students enrolled in 2008, the university had 17,500 students in the spring of 2017. A 2015 economic impact study revealed that the university was adding about $1 billion into the state's economy each year during its expansion. In February 2017, then Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said that the neighborhoods surrounding the university had experienced a 30% increase in housing values and a 30% decrease in crime rates.

By 2014, GCU students' accumulated student loan debt was estimated at more than $5.9 billion.

Citing GCU's controversial for-profit status, Arizona State University initially declined to play against GCU in any sport. ASU eventually reversed its position, and sporting events between the two universities recommenced in 2020.


### Attempts to return to nonprofit status

In fall 2014, the college announced the exploration of a return to nonprofit status. GCU's regional accreditation body, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), rejected the university's petition for conversion to nonprofit status in 2016, saying that the school's proposed strategy, particularly its plan to outsource some of its activities (such as curriculum development and student support services) to outside vendors, did not meet the criteria for such a conversion. In 2018, GCU submitted another application to HLC to change to nonprofit status. This application was accepted on July 1, 2018. Although some organizations have approved this transition, the U.S. Department of Education still classifies the university as a for-profit university. The government specifically says that GCU is a captive client to Grand Canyon Education and operating for the benefit of a for-profit company's shareholders. Grand Canyon Education has also been accused of engaging in securities-law fraud with its relation to GCU.

Grand Canyon University was alleged to have switched from for-profit to nonprofit status due to its yearly $9.2 million property tax bill. Numerous school officials said this was unsustainable and a key reason the switch was made. Some critics of for-profit education criticized the relationship between GCU and GCE as too intertwined.

In 2021, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by GCU that claimed the university didn't receive all the coronavirus relief funds to which it was entitled because it was a nonprofit entity. The same year, GCU sued the U.S. Department of Education after being denied nonprofit status twice. The suit was initially dismissed in 2022 after a federal judge rejected the university's claims.

In October 2023, a GCU press release alleged that there was a concerted effort by the U.S. Department of Education, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Veterans Affairs to punish the school for attempting to gain nonprofit status.

In November 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled by unanimous 3–0 decision that the U.S. Department of Education erred in denying GCU nonprofit status by applying the wrong standard of assessment. The Dept. of Education was ordered to reevaluate according to a different standard.


### Regulatory sanctions

In 2008, the federal government sued GCU for paying enrollment counselors according to how many students they had enrolled while at the same time accepting federal financial aid, a violation of the Department of Education's incentive compensation ban. GCU reached a settlement in the case, and was forced to pay a $5.2 million fine to a former employee and the government.

In 2023 the Department of Education fined the company $37.7 million for deceiving students about the cost of doctoral degrees. The department alleged that 78% of students graduating in those programs paid about 25% more than the cost that GCU represented, with much of the extra charges accumulating from additional "continuation classes" for completing the dissertation requirement. Only 2% paid the represented cost. The school disputed the allegation, claiming in addition that it provides more information than is legally required. GCU is the largest recipient of federal student aid. In addition to the fine, the department imposed conditions on the school to continue participating in the federal student aid programs.

Also in 2023, the Federal Trade Commission filed a federal lawsuit alleging that GCU deceived prospective doctoral students about the cost of its program and its for-profit status. The suit asserted that GCU paid 60% of its revenues to the for-profit Grand Canyon Education company and was the company's most significant source of revenue. The university and company had the same CEO.


## Campuses


### Main campus in Phoenix

In 2006, the college spent $150 million to renovate the campus, adding a brick promenade, an aquatics center, and a café.

In 2009, GCU began work on a $60 million campus expansion project, including a 500-bed dormitory, a 55,000-square-foot (5,100 m²) fitness and recreation center, 125-classroom facility, food court and bowling alley, and a 5,000-seat arena. The GCU Arena, which opened on September 2, 2011, is used for concerts, speakers, and other events. The arena is also home to the college's men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball games. The arena was expanded to 7,000 seats in 2014. GCU offers several fast food restaurants, coffee shops, student union, cafeteria, video game room, and six-lane bowling alley for student recreation. In August 2016, the university announced the establishment of the GCU Police Department.

In August 2016, GCU announced its 10 in 2 initiative, the building of 10 on-campus athletic facilities in a two-year span. Highlights of the project included new facilities for the university's soccer, baseball, softball, tennis and beach volleyball programs. It also included a sports medicine expansion, an equipment room expansion, practice facilities for the basketball and golf programs, and a student-athlete academic center.


### Accelerated Nursing (ABSN) learning sites

In 2020, the university opened its first two ABSN locations, in Sun City and Tucson.

On May 9, 2022, GCU opened an ABSN location in Sandy, Utah.

GCU's 4th ABSN location is in Henderson, Nevada.

On September 7, 2023, GCU announced the opening of its 5th ABSN location in Chandler, Arizona.
