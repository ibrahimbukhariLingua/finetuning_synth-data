### Pandora Papers

The Pandora Papers leaks found that one of Androsov's funds was linked to a corruption scandal in the Maldives that cost the country nearly $80 million. Lang Capital Fund had invested in an island resort in the Maldives. The Fund's investment and many others ultimately disappeared, and no resorts were ever built. Leaked documents implicated former Maldives President Abdulla Yameen in the scheme. Androsov denied that he or Lang Capital had engaged in any wrongdoing. President Yameen was convicted of fraud charges related to the scandal in 2019, but was released on an appeal in his case in 2021.

Androsov's name appeared in the Pandora Papers and the Paradise Papers along with other Singapore-based Russian businessmen in connection with compliance failures by a Singapore-based firm, Asiaciti Trust. Asiaciti was cited by regulators for its inadequate risk assessment and monitoring of some of the trust structures used by its Russians clients. Many of Asiaciti's clients, including Lang Capital Fund, were accused of being set up by closely-linked Politically-Exposed Persons. Androsov was linked to Evgeny Novitsky, a Russian billionaire who has held shares in one of Russia’s largest cellphone networks and leads RTI Systems which makes high end electornics. Asiaciti suspected that Novitsky was actually in control of companies registered to Androsov. Androsov denied the allegations.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) noted that a “series of circular fund flows — including some demonstrating no plausible economic purpose — were allowed to pass through the trust accounts managed by Asiaciti.” In April 2019, Asiaciti staff acknowledged “instances of inconsistencies and transactions that do not make clear economic sense” in relation to its Russian clients. Executives at the firm decided to sever ties with Androsov's companies and planned to file “suspicious transaction reports” with authorities. In July 2020, MAS fined Asiaciti $1.1 million for breaches identified in their investigation. MAS made no findings that Androsov was involved in money laundering or any other illegal activity connected with the trust structures set up and administered by Asiaciti. In October 2021, Androsov told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he still does business with Asiaciti.
