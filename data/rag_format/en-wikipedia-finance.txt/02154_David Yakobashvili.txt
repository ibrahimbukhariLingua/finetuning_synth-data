## Wimm Bill Dann

The Wimm Bill Dann (WBD) company was established in 1992 by Sergei Plastinin (his daughter Kira Plastinina) and Mikhail Dubinin. The business began with a leased juice bottling line and a loan of US$50 thousand. Plastinin and Dubinin invited David Yakobashvili. Together with other partners, they leased a juice bottling line at the Lianozovsky Dairy Plant. The first name for the juices was given the name of the company itself: the word "Wimm Bill Dann" was coined in assonance with the English "Wimbledon". Developing the western theme, the founders of the company in 1994 came up with the brand "J7" (English Seven Juices), and a year later WBD bought the shares of the Lianozovsky Plant and began to produce dairy products.
In 2002 the company conducted an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, becoming the first Russian food company to carry out an IPO. During the placement, the company's valuation amounted to US$830 million, the largest buyer of shares was French Danone.
In 2011 Wimm Bill Dann was acquired by PepsiCo Corporation for US$5.7 billion. This was the largest PepsiCo transaction outside of North America and the largest foreign investment in the non-oil market in Russia. According to media estimates, David Iakobachvili earned about US$600 million from the sale of 10% of WBD.

## GreenBooster

## Collecting and museum "Collection"

Yakobashvili is a well-known collector of mechanical musical instruments, clocks and caskets, Russian bronze, art silver, items of Russian and West-European Applied and Decorative Arts.

He first became interested in collecting business because of his friendship with Bill Lindvall, whom David Yakobashvili met and made friends with while working in Sweden in the 80s. Bill Lindvall turned out to be a fan of old self-playing instruments - barrel organ and organs. Fearing that after his death, his children would sell off the collection he had, Lindvall sold it to Yakobashvili on condition that he would continue his collecting business. The collection of Lindvall's musical mechanics, which he had been collecting for over 40 years, had about 460 items.

In 2018-2019 Yakobashvili opened the museum "Collection" in the center of Moscow (Russia). The "Collection" is a new cultural and educational project. The museum's collection has more than 20 thousand exhibits divided into unique sections: mechanical musical instruments and objects, decorative arts and jewelry, fine arts, clocks, prints and records. The museum occupies a new, modern building.
