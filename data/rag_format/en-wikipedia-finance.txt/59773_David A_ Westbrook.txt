Westbrook focused on three movements and discussed the various methods for forming an elite consensus along with the relevant major conceptual obstacles.

Westbrook published his book, *City Of Gold: An Apology for Global Capitalism in a Time of Discontent* in 2003. The book was reviewed as "a powerful demonstration of the limits at which global capitalism may be seen as an effective and efficient way of organizing economic interaction in our cosmopolitan society." According to E. Fuat Keyman, "*In City of Gold*, Westbrook makes a significant contribution to the literature on globalization by going beyond a purely market-based or a state-centric analysis of social change".

After the Global Financial Crisis, Westbrook focused on the failures of classical economic thought, and discussed new ways to regulate financial markets

In 2010, Westbrook published his book, *Out of Crisis: Rethinking Our Financial Markets'*, which was reviewed as "a fascinating new book" which "is a compelling and entertaining diatribe against some of the sacred cows of finance." Mae Kuykendall reviewed that "Westbrook draws on his wide knowledge of law, finance, literary theory, cultural anthropology, and political history to guide us through our recent disaster."
