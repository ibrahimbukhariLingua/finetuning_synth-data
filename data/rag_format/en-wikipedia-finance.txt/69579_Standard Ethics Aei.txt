# Standard Ethics Aei



**Standard Ethics** is an independent sustainability reporting rating agency based in London, known for its sustainable finance and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) studies. In 2001, it introduced a standardized approach to sustainability ratings. Methodologically, it separates Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) from sustainability, seeing the latter as a global and systemic approach whose definition is not given by a single entity but by international institutions.

Standard Ethics promotes sustainability and corporate governance with the *Standard Ethics Rating*, an evaluation of how well companies and sovereign nations respond to corporate governance and sustainability, as indicated by guidelines published by the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the European Union.

The Standard Ethics Business Model is based on the *applicant-pay model*. Like credit rating agencies, Standard Ethics sells solicited ratings, meaning it charges applicants for ratings. Once assigned, the rating and related analysis belong to the applicant. Conversely, under the investor-pay model, agencies charge investors a fee for a list of companies that warrant investment.


## Standard Ethics Rating

The **Standard Ethics Rating** (SER) is a Solicited Sustainability Rating (SSR) evaluating how well companies and sovereign nations comply with the sustainability and corporate governance guidelines published by the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the European Union (EU).

The rating does not use weightings and KPI-based analyses or indicators but applies a proprietary six-group variable algorithm.

Standard Ethics links the rating to an evaluation done both at a qualitative and quantitative level of the potential reputational risks for a company. This process aims to protect corporate assets, particularly corporate reputation. Companies believe that EU, OECD and UN recommendations suggest future legislative requirements. Therefore, complying with a standardized model like the SER could bring a competitive advantage.

The methodological approach of Standard Ethics was first introduced in 2001, and its ratings are based on a scale comprising nine letter grades: EEE; EEE−; EE+; EE; EE−; E+; E; E−; F; where "EEE" stands for 'above average'; "EE" for 'average'; and "E" for 'below average'.
