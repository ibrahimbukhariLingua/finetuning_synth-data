## History

On July 24, 2015, the Malaysian government suspended the publishing license of the Edge media group's two print publications, the *Edge Weekly* and the *Edge Financial News*, alleging that their coverage of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad threatened the country's national security and public order. The Edge's print publications were suspended for three months, beginning on 27 July 2015. The suspension of *The Edge* newspapers was criticized by several opposition politicians, the Institute of Journalists Malaysia, and business leaders, including the CIMB Group chairman Nazir Razak and Air Asia executive Tony Fernandes. On July 27, *The Edge* filed a judicial review challenging the ban.

In April 2023, The Edge Communications Sdn. Bhd. and its owner, Tan Sri Tong Kooi Ong, bought a stake in The Star Media Group, with Tong owning a direct interest of 0.25% stake and a 5.17% indirect interest through The Edge Communications.
