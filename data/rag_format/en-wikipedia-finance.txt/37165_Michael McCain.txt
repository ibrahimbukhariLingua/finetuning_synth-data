As CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, McCain's handling of the 2008 listeria outbreak was met with overall praise. The Globe and Mail has referred to McCain as "a role model for crisis management" for his contributions toward ameliorating the incident. Writing in The Conversation, Deborah de Lange complimented McCain's transparency, ethics, and communication skills during the outbreak, referring to his "track record of leadership", and Hill+Knowlton Strategies's Jane Shapiro referred to it as "a textbook case of how to handle a crisis". McCain was named the Business Newsmaker of 2008 by the Canadian press. Writing a 2013 case study in the Financial Times, business theorist Morgen Witzel noted that in addition to accepting responsibility, McCain's recovery strategy included a hiring freeze but open hiring in the food safety department, which was to hire at any cost.

In January 2020, McCain criticized "a narcissist in Washington" regarding the events that preceded Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 being shot down by Iran, from the company Twitter account. McCain, a well-known philanthropist, was lauded by some, for his humanity, and criticized by others, for supplanting shareholder primacy, as reactive calls for a boycott of the company impacted stock prices.

In May 2022, McCain announced that he was appointed as the executive chairman of Maple Leaf Foods and will hand over CEO responsibilities to Curtis Frank by the 2023 annual meeting. On May 11, 2023, Curtis Frank was appointed as CEO.
