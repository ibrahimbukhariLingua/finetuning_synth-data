Meta marketing


# Meta marketing



**Meta marketing** is "the synthesis of all managerial, traditional, scientific, social and historical foundations of marketing,‚Äù a term first coined by E.J.Kelly while discussing the issue of ethics and science of marketing Thus, Meta Marketing is an attempt to widen the horizons of marketing by covering non-profit organisations. The best examples of Meta Marketing can be selling family planning ideas or the idea of prohibition.

A Meta market will bring all buyers and sellers in one place for one purpose only. Instead of giving multiple products to one customer, a Meta market brings together different customers who need not necessarily differentiate between closely related products.
Meta market is thus, a place, where everything connected with a certain market can be found. Let's say a car selling in a Meta market would be a website, that sells cars but you will also find car parts there, add-ons for cars, colours for cars, mechanic's reviews, etc. So Meta market of a certain market is a market, where you can find everything about that market and everything about markets that are strongly connected to that market.

Meta marketing is an approach to the study of marketing and its relationship to every aspect of life by focussing on all social, ethical, scientific and business experience in marketing, thus establishing a body of knowledge base on the integration of every facet of experience with the human personality.


## Historical Development

The concept of meta-marketing emerged in response to the limitations of traditional product-centric marketing approaches. Prior to the 1970s, businesses primarily focused on manufacturing capabilities and product development, with marketing considered a secondary, post-production activity. This perspective began to shift as markets became more competitive and consumer behavior more complex.


## Key Developments:
