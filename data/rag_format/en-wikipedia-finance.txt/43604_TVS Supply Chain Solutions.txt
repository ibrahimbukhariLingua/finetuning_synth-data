## History

The company began in 1995 as **TVS Logistics**, a division of TVS & Sons, before being hived off as a separate company in 2004 as **TVS Logistics Services Ltd.** (**TVS LSL**). In 2004 it bought out the UK based CJ Components – an automotive component sourcing company. The company pursued further acquisitions across Europe, the UK, the USA, Singapore and Australia.

In 2009, TVS LSL acquired Multipart Holding, which is among the top three after market logistics companies in UK. With the Multipart acquisition, TVS LSL formed a European subsidiary, TVS Supply Chain Solutions (TVS SCS) from JC and Multipart. This was followed in 2012 by the acquisition of same day courier and IT support and logistics firm Rico Logistics for ₹100 crore (£11.81 million). Rico operated as a subsidiary of TVS SCS and was renamed TVS SCS Rico in 2017.

TVS Logistics was then renamed to **TVS Supply Chain Solutions** in 2019.

In 2020, Mitsubishi Corp invested in TVS Supply Chain Solutions for minority stake.

In August 2023, the company launched its initial public offering and got listed on the Indian stock exchanges.
