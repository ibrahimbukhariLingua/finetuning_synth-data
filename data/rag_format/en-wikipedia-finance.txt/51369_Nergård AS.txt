The highest absence was in the fish catching department were there too has been a big decline relative to the earlier years.
Nergård has hired someone from occupational safety to take a closer look and prevent employee injuries while they are at work. Some positions in the group has a good share of heavy work with challenges of loud noises, moisture and cold temperatures. This is something the staff is trying to do something with, with hiring the occupational safety consultant.
The group has their production companies localised in smaller places in North-Norway. This is a challenge to access and labor and has led to hiring of foreign men on contracts. Foreign employees are a challenge with the program that the company has, but that is a big priority to the staff to get it to work as well as possible.

## History

The history of Nergård AS goes way back to the end of the 1940s. It all began in 1947 with a fishing boat that was called *Ovedia* that was owned by Arvid and Olga Nergård. The boat was used to travel along the coast of Finnmark and Lofoten to buy fish that were gutted and salted on board before it was sold to people. They had the boat for many years and were very successful. This developed to their purchase of a factory at the start of 1972. The factory was sited at Lysnes in Senja that is in Nord of Norway. Here the company "Arvid Nergård AS" was started. After a while, their son Ole-Arvid took over. He developed the company from being a factory in Lysnes to be a big group with many subsidiaries all around North-Norway.

In 2008 the owner Ole-Arvid died after being sick since 2006. After his death, the family chose to sell the shares in Nergård AS and the company got a new owner and a new name. So in 2010 was Nergård AS changed to Nergård Holding AS.
