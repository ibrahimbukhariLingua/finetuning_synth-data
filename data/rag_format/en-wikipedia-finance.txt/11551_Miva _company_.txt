## History

Miva Merchant began in 1996 as the HTMLScript Corporation. In 1997, the company released its first catalogue-based ecommerce product, KoolKat. Shortly after KoolKat's release, the name of the company was changed to Miva, Inc, and KoolKat was renamed Miva Merchant. Since that time, there have been several updates to Miva Merchant's core software, leading up to the most recent version, Miva Merchant 9. Just prior to the release of MM9, the company name returned to Miva, Inc.

In 2003 the company was purchased by FindWhat.com which changed its name to Miva, Inc in 2005.


## Present day

In 2007, the company underwent significant management changes, and was acquired by a group of investors and original Miva, Inc employees. The company name was changed to Miva Merchant, Inc. at that time in order to differentiate itself from the original Miva, Inc.

In 2008, Miva Merchant released Miva Merchant 5.5, a core software update that added improved features and functionality.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
