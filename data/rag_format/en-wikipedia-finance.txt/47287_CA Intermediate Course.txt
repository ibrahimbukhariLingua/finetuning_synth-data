CA Intermediate Course


# CA Intermediate Course



**CA Intermediate** is the second level exam, of a course in India, Chartered Accountancy. It has six subjects and over 7000 pages of study material that a student is expected to cover in the nine months study period allotted to them.

The group system is what makes this exam even more difficult, as a group consists of three subjects, and a candidate has to pass all three papers in order to clear the group. Failure to pass in one subject immediately results in the failure of the entire group, which would mean that the student fails in the subjects in which he has passed.

The average passing percentage up to the year 2020 has been 16.76% only, which means only 4 out of every 25 students appearing for the exam manage to pass it. That being said, the least passing percentage was just 8.88% in the attempt of November 2018
