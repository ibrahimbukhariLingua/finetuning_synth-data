## Bentley University

In 2007 Larson was named president of Bentley University by the board of trustees. Larson was drawn to the school because of its approach to redefining business educationâ€”by infusing a business curriculum with the arts and sciences. During Larson's tenure, the former Bentley College became a university and established a number of new programs focused on the value of a business education.

At the undergraduate level, the school expanded its commitment to a "fused" curriculum with double majors in business and the liberal arts, as well as new courses co-taught by business and arts and sciences faculty. One of its most recent innovations, the Bentley MBA, is an 11-month global program where students pursue four 10-week modules in a collaborative, studio-based setting.

Larson also launched the Center for Women and Business at Bentley in 2011 committed to advancing shared leadership among
women and men in the corporate world and developing women business leaders. A nationally recognized university leader, Larson is a member of the Executive Committee of the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment and a member of the Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) Presidents' Trust.

Larson stepped down as president of Bentley in June 2018.
