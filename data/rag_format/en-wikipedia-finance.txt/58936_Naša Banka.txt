After the collapse and closure of **Bobar banka** and **Banka Srpske**, according to media reports, it was stated that the operation of Pavlović International Banka was also threatened.

Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik in 2022 repeated his denial of allegations that he received a fictitious loan from a friendly bank to buy a pricey villa, after being grilled by Prosecutor's Office of BiH. The case dates back to 2016, when it was alleged that the "Pavlović International Banka" had extended to Dodik a fake mortgage to enable the property purchase, in order to hide the real origin of the money.
