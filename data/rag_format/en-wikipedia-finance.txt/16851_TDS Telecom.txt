TDS Telecom is a participant in the FCC's Connect America Fund, also known as A-CAM. With this funding TDS is on a ten-year push to bring high speed internet to the furthest reaches of its rural serving areas. Depending on location, the vast majority of TDS customers in eligible rural areas are expected to receive broadband speeds of 25 Mbit/s download and 3 Mbit/s upload (25/3). The remaining customers are expected to receive broadband speeds at 10/1 and 4/1 Mbit/s. In less rural areas, TDS provides much higher broadband speeds, from 100 Mbps to 8 Gbps.

More recently, TDS has been launching new fiber to the home services across Wisconsin and Idaho. The new markets in Wisconsin include: Deforest, Windsor, McFarland, Monona Grove, Cottage Grove, Oregon, and Merrimac municipalities, all within Dane County. In Idaho the cities cities Coeur d'Alene, Rathdrum, Hayden, and Post Falls, all within Kootenai County. These services are offered by TDS through CLEC TDS Metrocom, LLC which is operated by TDS Telecom. Fiber to the home markets are 1 Gigabit speed markets with multiple speed offerings available to customers.


## TDS Metrocom

**TDS Metrocom** is TDS Telecom's local phone business, providing customers with phone, data, and Internet services in a five-state area in the midwestern United States. Its central office is located at 3416 University Ave in Madison, Wisconsin. Unlike Telecom, Metrocom used a deal brokered by Tommy Thompson to allow for local phone service competition on AT&T's lines in exchange for long distance plan selling rights over landline. They are no longer offering this service to new residential subscribers, but continue to maintain existing contracts, new features, or new locations on existing accounts. TDS Metrocom is currently in maintenance mode, where they are allowed to maintain existing telephone and Internet installations but not add any new telephone or Internet accounts. Business accounts are still available.
