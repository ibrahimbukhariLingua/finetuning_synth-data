## History

Jacques Potdevin has been leading JPA since 1975, succeeding his father Roger, who was also a chartered accountant and statutory auditor and founded the firm in 1947 in Paris. In 1987, Jacques Potdevin established the international network of the same name.

The network experienced significant growth in the early 1990s in Europe. In 1992, following the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty and the creation of the single market, the JPA network was established in 11 European countries, generating 200 million francs in revenue and employing 600 people. The network's objective at that time was to position itself as the preferred partner for SMEs.

JPA International continued its international expansion in the 2000s, including in Lebanon in 2002. By the end of 2004, the network had 90 offices in 40 countries.

In 2018, the network's leaders stated that their presence was nearing 60 countries. By the late 2010s, the network expanded into Latin America, notably in Mexico in 2019 and Chile in 2020.
