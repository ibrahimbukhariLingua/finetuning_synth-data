## Work

Malmendier's work focuses on behavioral economics, corporate finance, and law and economics. She has conducted extensive research on CEO overconfidence where she found that overconfident CEOs invested too much money in their companies and pursued destructive acquisitions more frequently than other managers.

She has explored how behavioral biases affect financial decision-making in other contexts. Malmendier has found that people who lived through the Great Depression remain more frugal throughout their lives, a majority of people overestimate how often they will visit the gym, and that security analysts distort recommendations for profit.

Malmendier has also done research into the origin of shareholder companies. She has examined an early form of shareholder company in ancient Rome called the societas publicanorum.


## Honors and awards

In 2013, she won the prestigious Fischer Black Prize, presented biennially by the American Finance Association for significant original research in finance. In 2019, she was awarded the Gustav Stolper Prize by the German Verein für Socialpolitik. In 2021, she was named a Fellow of the Econometric Society.
