### Finance

Dallen was head of the investment bank Caracas Capital Markets, managing partner at family office Ophiuchus Capital Management, strategic advisor to the exchange-traded Venezuela Opportunity Fund. From 2000 to 2007, he was head of the Latin American office of investment bank Oppenheimer & Co. in Caracas, Venezuela. He then oversaw capital market activities for BBO, a Venezuelan investment bank.

Dallen's investing was chronicled by the Financial Times in a 2014 article, saying, "…The basket of defaulted Argentina bonds, bought by Dallen for clients last year when they were trading for 30 something cents on the dollar, rose through the mid 1980s to reach a bid price of 90 cents on the dollar." He sold them at 150, quintupling his clients' and firm's investments.

In Venezuela, Dallen began pointing out shortages, including being the first to point out most famously the toilet paper shortage—in January 2013 when oil was above $100 a barrel and warning of the economic collapse that would come. At the same time, Dallen was able to double investments of his firm and clients in Harvest Natural Resources (NYSE: HNR) in one month before taking profits and earn a 60% return in 6 months in Venezuelan Koch brothers entity Fertinitro.

In early 2016, Dallen began warning that Venezuela would default on its billions in foreign debt, telling Reuters that "It is a question of when, not if," and noting that "The only thing that could change that is a sharp recovery in oil prices, and/or a bailout from Venezuela's friends in China, Russia or Iran."

Keying on cashflows from China and Russia, Dallen would help discover and publicize that Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA was so short of cash that they had mortgaged 49.9% of their U.S. oil refinery Citgo to Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft and he would later be called upon to testify about Russia's actions before Congress.

The *Financial Times* in an article titled "Venezuela stopped bond payments in September" credited Dallen with the discovery and proof.

Bloomberg noted that Dallen and his investors were able to profit from his default prediction—for a 300% return when Venezuela and PDVSA were declared in default in November by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).
