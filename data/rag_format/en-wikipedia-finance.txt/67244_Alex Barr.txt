## Bramdean Alternatives

Bramdean Alternatives was an investment company formerly run by Nicola Horlick which got caught up in the Madoff investment scandal. Following this in June 2009 Vincent Tchenguiz utilised his investment company Elsina to seize control at an Extraordinary General Meeting. Subsequently in November 2009 Horlick lost control of Bramdean Alternatives as the investment management contract with her Bramdean Asset Management business was acquired by Aberdeen Asset Management. Barr was then responsible for rebranding the company as Aberdeen Private Equity and taking over the running of it.
