## History

The roots of Grupo Salvador Caetano can be traced, in 1946, to Salvador Fernandes Caetano (1926–2011) then with the name "Martins, Caetano & Irmão, Lda.", in the coachbuilding sector, becoming the first coachbuilder in Portugal (Salvador's brother (irmão), Alfredo Caetano, some years afterwards, founded another coachbuilding company, named after him: recently the company was renamed as Starbus, as well as Mr. Joaquim Martins who founded JD Martins).

In 1965, the workshops in Oliveira do Douro were inaugurated and in 1971, Salvador Caetanos's first industrial unit for vehicle assembly was built in Ovar.

In 1968, Salvador Caetano became the importer of Toyota, introducing the brand in Portugal. Since 2003, they are assembling the Dyna medium truck for export to several West European markets.

In 1982, Baviera, the importer of BMW in Portugal, was acquired by Salvador Caetano.

On 27 June 2011, the company founder, Salvador Fernandes Caetano, died. Caetano's achievements brought him several commendations from both the Portuguese and the Japanese government.

## Caetano UK Limited

**Salvador Caetano (UK) Limited** was established in 1984 as an associated United Kingdom company of Salvador Caetano. It specialises in both the marketing of new own-brand vehicles and used vehicles of other coachbuilders, along with repairs.

The initial location was in rented premises on Weedon Road in Northampton, England. In 1986, the company was briefly associated with The Moseley Group, based in Loughborough, England, which bought a proportion of the UK business. This link was short-lived, being cancelled a few months afterwards.

The company moved to a purpose-built facility in Heather, Leicestershire, England in 1989, built on land acquired from (and located next to) Reliant Coaches Limited, which it subsequently purchased in 1998.

Also, in 1998, the company set up a new company **S C Coachbuilders Ltd**, which was based at a factory in Waterlooville, England, acquired from administrators acting on behalf of Universal Vehicles Group. The site was developed to include a repair facility and parts warehouse, as well as new vehicle production. However, production of new bodywork ceased in 2007 and the site was sold in 2009.

In 2006, after a management restructure, the UK division started operating under the name of Caetano UK Limited.
