National Treasury Management Agency


# National Treasury Management Agency



The **National Treasury Management Agency** (NTMA; Irish: *Gníomhaireacht Bainistíochta an Chisteáin Náisiúnta*, GBCN) is the agency that manages the assets and liabilities of the Government of Ireland. It was established on 1 December 1990 to borrow for the Central Fund and manage the national debt. Since then it has been expanded greatly, for example it now manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund and acts as Ireland's agent for the purchase of carbon credits. Following the RTÉ secret payment scandal, the Government of Ireland agreed to add RTÉ to the list of commercial State sector companies subject to the formal oversight of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA)’s NewEra unit.

The National Asset Management Agency was established in December 2009 under the aegis of the agency to handle the Irish financial crisis and the deflation of the Irish property bubble.


## Ireland Strategic Investment Fund

The NTMA also handles the €8.1 billion Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF; Irish: *An Ciste Infheistíochta Straitéisí d’Éirinn*, GBCN), a sovereign wealth fund established on 22 December 2014.

Formed using the remaining assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, ISIF has a statutory mandate to invest in a fashion designed to support Ireland's employment and economic activity.²⁵
