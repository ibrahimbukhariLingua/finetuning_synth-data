# Anne Heraty



**Anne Heraty** is an Irish business woman. She is co-founder, major stake-holder and also CEO of CPL Resources.


## CPL

In 1989 Heraty and Keith O'Malley founded *Computer Placement Ltd.* a company placing people at IT companies that were starting to set up businesses in Ireland. In 1992 she takes over all shares from other stake-holders (including O'Malley) and from then on she own's 100% of the shares in CPL.

In 1996 Heraty's husband, Paul Carrol, joins the group and in 1999 they decide to bring CPL to the market: CPL Resources Plc. starts trading on the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. With this Heraty becomes the first female CEO of an Irish company floated on the stock-exchange.

Heraty announced she would be standing down as CEO of CPL Resources on January 1, 2022.


## Business women of the year

Due to her position as first female CEO of a listed Irish company she gets known to the larger public. In 2006 she wins the *Ernst & Young Businesswomen of the year award* and according to the website *Business and Leadership* she ranks number 26 on the list of most powerful women in Ireland.

Over the years this status results in her being asked to become member of several boards of directors with other companies. The most important involvements are:

* non-executive director of Anglo Irish Bank
* non-executive director of Irish Stock Exchange
* non-executive director of Forfas
* non-executive director of Bord na Mona

## Anglo Irish Bank

The most well-known position outside CPL is her role at Anglo Irish Bank. Relatively early in the downfall of the bank, shortly after the state took over ownership, Heraty stepped down from the board.


## Other board-memberships

Within a week of stepping down at Anglo she also quits her non-exec directorships at Forfas and Bord na Mona.

Herarty is a board member of Ibec, Ireland's largest business organisation and lobbying group.
