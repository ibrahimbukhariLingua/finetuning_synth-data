## History

BDO Unibank was established on January 2, 1968 as Acme Savings Bank, a thrift bank with just two branches in the area before Metro Manila was formed. In November 1976, Acme was acquired by the SM Group, the group of companies owned by retail magnate Henry Sy, and renamed Banco de Oro Savings and Mortgage Bank.

In December 1994, BDO became a commercial bank and was renamed Banco de Oro Commercial Bank. In September 1996, BDO became a universal bank, which led to the bank's name being changed to the current Banco de Oro Universal Bank (BDO Unibank).

BDO Unibank eventually became involved in insurance services in 1997 (it is a bancassurance firm) by establishing a subsidiary called BDO Insurance Brokers. In 1999, BDO Unibank expanded its insurance services through partnerships with Zamora Assurance and Assicurazoni Generali s.p.a. (Generali), one of the world's largest insurance firms, and Jerneh Asia Berhad, a member of Malaysia's Kuok Group. In March 2000, BDO Unibank partnered with Generali Pilipinas Life Assurance Company and Generali Pilipinas Insurance Company.

### Equitable PCI Bank

On August 5, 2005, BDO Unibank and an SM subsidiary, SM Investments, bought 24.76% of the shares of Equitable PCI Bank, the Philippines' third-largest bank, and 10% of an Equitable PCI affiliate, Equitable CardNetwork, one of the Philippines' largest credit card issuers, from the Go Family which founded the bank. BDO Unibank has also been offered a further 10% by another Equitable PCI affiliate, EBC Investments, and a deal is being made to buy (awaiting court approval) the 29% stake of the Social Security System (SSS), the Philippines' private sector workers' pension fund. Subsequent acquisitions enabled the bank to acquire a 34% stake in Equitable PCI.

On December 1, 2005, BDO Unibank shares were listed as a component of the PSE Composite Index for the first time.

On January 6, 2006, BDO Unibank, with the SM Group of Companies, submitted to Equitable PCI a merger offer with BDO Unibank as the surviving entity. Under the proposal, BDO Unibank will swap 1.6 of its shares for every 1 Equitable PCI share. As a second option, BDO Unibank also offered to base the swap ratio on the book values of both banks to be assessed by an independent accounting firm using International Accounting Standards (IAS). To effect the merger, BDO Unibank needs consent of Equitable PCI shareholders representing 67% of Equitable PCI. These include the Social Security System (SSS) with 29%, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) with 14%, and the family of Equitable PCI chairman Ferdinand Martin Romualdez with eight percent. BDO Unibank said that the proposed "merger of equals" would create the country's second biggest bank with assets of about ₱608 billion (as of June 2007), just next to Metrobank with ₱669.1 billion (as of June 2007), the current banking industry leader in the Philippines. Bank of the Philippine Islands is the current third biggest bank in the Philippines with P592.6 billion (as of June 2007). BDO Unibank has asked Equitable PCI to study their offer until January 31, 2006.

BDO Unibank President Nestor Tan also expressed of a possibility of a three-way merger with Chinabank, also an SM Group-controlled bank. Tan said that the proposed Banco de Oro-Equitable PCI merger would consolidate the strengths of BDO Unibank and Equitable PCI in consumer lending and result in a dominant player in middle-market lending and a market leader in money remittance volumes, branch banking, trust and corporate banking with the combined network of 685 branches located in the Philippines and abroad.

Although Romualdez and the GSIS have shown stiff opposition to the BDO Unibank-Equitable PCI merger, the SSS is still studying the possibility of a merger. In fact, UBS studied the deal and claims that the merger through the stock swap option is a "win-win" situation. It also claims that the deal under IAS standards are timely enough to facilitate the merger and that with the merger, Equitable PCI shareholders, under UBS calculation, would see the value of their shares increase to about ₱73.60 per share, more than the fair value target price of ₱67.
