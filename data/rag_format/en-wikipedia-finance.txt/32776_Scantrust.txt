## Product authentication and traceability

The company has developed a QR Code system with an additional layer of protection against copying, based on inserting a copy detection pattern or secure graphic which loses information when it is copied. The technology does not require special materials, inks, and modifications to printing equipment to implement. Related product authentication and traceability data can be stored into a blockchain.

QR codes used in Scantrust authentication and traceability systems are printed on product packaging and scanned with a smartphone to authenticate and track products. The company provides a free app to consumers which can be used to scan products with the copy detection pattern and help detect counterfeits. Scanning of a code with a smartphone can also offer a traceability feature with origin and supply chain information made about the product made available An enterprise app is also provided for employees, distributors and forensic inspections.
