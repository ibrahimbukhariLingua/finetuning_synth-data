# Bibojee Group



**Bibojee Group** (Urdu pronunciation: [biː.boˈdʒiː] bee-bo-JEE) is a group of companies headquartered in Karachi. It is among the major enterprises in Pakistan, incorporating businesses in manufacturing – textiles, automotive vehicles, tyres, insurance, and construction industries.


## History

Bibojee Group was founded by retired military officer Lieutenant General Habibullah Khan Khattak during Ayub Khan administration. Ghandhara Industries Limited was acquired by Gohar Ayub Khan and his father-in-law, Habibullah Khan Khattak from General Motors. In August 1969, following the political overthrow of Gohar Ayub's father, Ayub Khan, he sold all his shares in the company to the National Investment Trust and the Investment Corporation of Pakistan. The subsequent nationalization of Gandhara Industries in 1973 was viewed by some as a move against Gohar Ayub's interests, possibly serving as political retribution. Additional acts of perceived political vengeance included the cancellation of the government's sale of Bannu Sugar Mills and Sutlej Textile Mills to Bibojee Group during the waning days of martial law.

In 1970, Bibojee Group established Ghandhara Diesels Limited, focused on manufacturing and selling diesel engines under the Bedford brand for trucks and tractors. The company was nationalized in 1972 and was later renamed as Bela Engineers Limited. The following year, it was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange.
