Initially designed in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this real-time system automated the processing of traveler documents, specifically focusing on PCR (Covid Medical Certificate) and HP (Health Pass). Its primary function was to determine in real-time whether a passenger was fit to travel based on health criteria during the pandemic.
