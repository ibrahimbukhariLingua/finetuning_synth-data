## Controversies


### Involvement in coalgate scam

Jindal Steel and Power was one of the two private companies to get a coal field in February 2009. JSPL got the Talcher coal field in Angul with reserves of 150 crore (1,500 million) metric tonnes after the cut-off date by the Central Government, while the Government-run Navratna Coal India Ltd was refused.

Both the blocks were in Odisha, with a combined worth of over ₹2 lakh crore, and were meant for liquification of coal. The opposition parties alleged that the Government violated all norms in granting the coal fields. Naveen Jindal, however, denied any wrongdoing.


### Iron ore reserve mining in Bolivia

On 3 June 2006, Bolivia granted development rights for one of the world's largest iron ore reserves in the El Mutún region to Jindal Steel. With an initial investment of US$1.5 billion, the company plans to invest an additional US$2.1 billion over the next eight years in the South American country.

Jindal Steel is likely to terminate the contract of investing $2.1 billion in setting up a steel plant in Bolivia, due to non-fulfilment of contractual obligations by the Bolivian Government.

In 2024, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce ruled in favor of Bolivia against the Indian company Jindal Steel Bolivia S.A. (JSB) that demanded compensation of 100 million dollars from the Bolivian State for the Mutún project, which is about to be completed in Santa Cruz.

The court, in its ruling, dismissed JSB's claims and declared that Empresa Siderúrgica de El Mutún (ESM) complied with all of its contractual obligations in good faith under Bolivian law. In addition, it determined that the Indian transnational must assume the costs of the arbitration, which amount to 740 thousand dollars, and pay the ESM more than 1.9 million dollars in costs and expenses, plus interest based on the yield of the bonds of the United States Treasury.
