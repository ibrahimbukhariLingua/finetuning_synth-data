## History

Hankook Tire was established in 1941 as "Chosun Tire Company"(Japanese: 朝鮮タイヤ工業) and was renamed to "Hankook Tire Manufacturing" in 1968. *Hankook* literally means "Korea". *Chosun* means *beautiful morning*.

The company now supplies tires as original equipment to various automakers. In addition to producing about 102 million tires annually, the company also sells batteries, alloy wheels, and brake pads.

In 2011, Hankook Tire Co. announced that the company will invest $1.1 billion to build a factory in West Java, Indonesia as part of a plan to become the 5th largest tire manufacturer in the world. On June 9, 2011 a ground breaking ceremony was held at a 60-hectare area as a regional hub production for export to Asian, North America and Middle East countries.

In October 2013, the company announced plans to open a new factory in Clarksville, Tennessee which was later opened in October 2017.

In November 2014, the company announced the launch of its second brand, Laufenn. In January 2025, the company announced the launch of its sub-brand, Optimo, in Europe. The Optimo brand complements Hankook's existing premium and associate brands focused on passenger car tires.
