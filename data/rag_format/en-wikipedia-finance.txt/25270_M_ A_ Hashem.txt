Hashem was elected to parliament in 2001 from Noakhali-2 as a Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidate. He was arrested by the caretaker government in 2007 during the 2006-2008 Bangladesh political crises along with most of the wealthiest people in the country at the time. He left the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2008 after the military-baked caretaker government regime in Bangladesh had ended and steadfastly denied his involvement in a business syndicate that manipulated commodity prices. He also said former prime minister Khaleda Zia had pressured him to join the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.

In January 1992, United Commercial Bank provided a 200 million taka loan to Russel Vegetable Oils Limited, an edible oil refiner. At that time, his wife, Sultana Hashem, and two brothers were directors of United Commercial Bank. Another loan was approved in November 1992 by the bank for the refinery for 4.5 million taka. The loan was rescheduled 4 times until 2000. The bank then sued the company to get its money back. In 2008, when Hashem and his son, Showkat Aziz Russell, were directors of United Commercial Bank; the bank agreed to settle the case for a payment of 50 million taka. Hashem is a founding member of United Commercial Bank and has served as the chairman for five years. He is also a founding member of The City Bank and has served as the chairperson for five years.

On 8 April 2011, A Dhaka court framed charges against Hashem and eight members of his family and employees on a tax evasion case. The case was filed by National Board of Revenue, which accused them of dodging 5.97 billion taka in taxes from 2006 to 2008. Hashem and the other accused pleaded not guilty and demanded justice before the court. The two-year period that Hashem was accused of evading tax (2006-2008) is also the same two-year period of the 2006-2008 Bangladesh political crises.
