* 2002- TMG acquired the futures broking division of Traderspace Limited (TSL) after which TMG divided their existing Australian business operations with their proprietary trading operation continuing under the TMG brand and the combined TMG and TSL Futures Broking Business becoming BrokerOne. TMG was for a time in the top quartile of brokerage houses as measured by volume on the Chicago futures exchanges.

* 2010-TMG's subsidiary Aardvark Trading and TMG’s domestic “arcade” operation agreed to merge operations. The merger integration between TMG domestic and Aardvark has largely been completed and resulted in the shift of TMG’s core business to team based model driven proprietary trading, though a small independent trading operation still remains. TMG’s previous international operations are being divested.
