## History

The original 9-story structure occupied half of a city block between Main Street and Travis Street, with the front facing Polk Street. This original structure was designed by prominent New York architects Clinton and Russell and cost approximately $1.2 million. It was the largest office building in Houston at the time, containing approximately 196,000 sq ft (18,200 m²) of space. A 1932 renovation added a central air conditioning system to the building, the first in any Houston office building.

Humble Oil and Refining Company expanded the building in 1936 with an adjacent 17-story tower. This expansion was designed by John F. Staub and Kenneth Franzheim. Additional expansions were made in 1940 and 1947; and the complex now contains 529,809 sq ft (49,220.9 m²).

In 1997, the building complex was purchased by Historic Restoration Inc., with plans to adapt the buildings into a mixed-use hotel, apartments, and retail space. The plans moved forward in 1999 with a loan from the City of Houston in the amount of $4.6 million in order to encourage the development. The plans were completed in 2003 and the building opened as a Courtyard by Marriott hotel, a Residence Inn hotel, and the Humble Tower apartments. It contained 360 hotel rooms, 82 'luxury' apartments, 6,721 sq ft (624.4 m²) of street-level retail, and a parking garage. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, under the category "Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals". The apartment section was converted to a third Marriott-branded Hotel in 2015, a Spring Hill Suites.
