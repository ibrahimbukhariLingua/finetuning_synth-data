BCB began by an Act of Parliament in February 1969. BCBs core banking system provides a suite of products, including online banking. In June of 2016, the BCB Group of Companies moved into a new location at 34 Bermudiana Road, Hamilton. In 2019, BCB also celebrated its 50-year anniversary of providing banking services to Bermuda and internationally.

In July 2021, the investment company, Provident Holdings Limited, purchased the BCB Group of Companies from Somers Limited.
