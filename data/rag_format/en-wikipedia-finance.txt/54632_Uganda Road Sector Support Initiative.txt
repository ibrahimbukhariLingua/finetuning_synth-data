Uganda Road Sector Support Initiative


# Uganda Road Sector Support Initiative



The **Uganda Road Sector Support Initiative** (**URSSI**), is a Ugandan transport advocacy nonprofit organization that works to improve governance in the transport sector, with a special focus on road transport. It is based in Uganda, the third-largest economy in the East African Community and impacts Sub-Saharan Africa.


## Overview

URSSI was founded in 2010 as a result of several challenges in the road sub-sector in Uganda. Being a pioneer NGO in the transport sector, it is the only CSO in the country that carries out research, advocacy and information dissemination about the sector.

URSSI is part of the *Transport Sector Working Group* which deliberates on issues affecting the sector and also avails essential information to Parliament and the general public to help counter corruption and abuse in the road construction industry. The activities of the organization are geared towards restructuring urban transformation and planning practices in developing countries.

Over the years, URSSI has advocated for Uganda to: join the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST); adopt and implement the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) and; drive the process of making citizens Road Monitoring Tool. URSSI is also the founding member and current host of the Civil Society Coalition on Transport in Uganda (CISCOT), a coalition of 25 member organizations, whose aim is to contribute to an efficient, effective and safe transport system.
