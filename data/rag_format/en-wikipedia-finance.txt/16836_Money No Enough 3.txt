## Plot

The film features three kampong friends and brothers who grew up and became very close together along with their family: Li Qing Huang, Zhang Ming Hui and Liang Da Qiang, whom are all young seniors, each face their own family and financial problems. Qing Huang is a delivery man doing delivery services, Ming Hui is an owner of a Teochew porridge stall and Da Qiang is a Grab driver. In their attempt to join forces and support each other, their grand plan falls apart when the younger generation challenges the beliefs and value systems of the trio. Qing Huang’s mounting debts drive him to desperate measures. He borrows money from Ming Hui and Da Qiang and builds illegal businesses that eventually prosper. However, his greed gets the better of him and he refuses to return any borrowed money from Ming Hui and Da Qiang. Amidst his financial success, one of his businesses collapses, impacting not only his own family but also families of Ming Hui and Da Qiang, the two of which had sold their cars and gave the money earned to Qing Huang for him to invest. After Kim Li, Qing Huang's daughter, falls out with her father Qing Huang over his increasing greediness and quits working for him, she walks into the rain in a daze and is struck by lightning. In addition, Ming Hui's wife ends up getting liver failure as she was eating health supplements from Qing Huang's business. After a series of tests are conducted on Ming Hui's family and relatives to find a liver donor, Qing Huang ends up being the only suitable one for Ming Hui's wife. Remorseful of his actions, he agrees to a liver transplant. After the successful operation, he is put under investigation by the police for his sale of illegal e-cigarettes in Singapore.
