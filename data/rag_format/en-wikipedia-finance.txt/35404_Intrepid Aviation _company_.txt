## History

Intrepid Aviation was founded by Ron Anderson, a 20-year employee of FedEx, in 1994 and was originally based in Memphis, Tennessee. The company started by buying used passenger aircraft and having them converted into cargo aircraft for leasing. In 2007, Intrepid placed an order for 20 Airbus A330-200 freighter aircraft. During the financial crisis of 2007â€“08, Intrepid had to negotiate delaying deliveries by three years.

The company subsequently reconstituted its management team and relocated its corporate headquarters to Stamford, CT. In 2014, the company filed for an IPO with a fundraising target of $150 million. The company currently has equity commitments of up to $650 million from existing shareholders., and raised $215 and $120 million in bonds on 2014 and 2015, respectively. In August 2015, Olaf Sachau was appointed as its CEO and Doug Winter as its President.
