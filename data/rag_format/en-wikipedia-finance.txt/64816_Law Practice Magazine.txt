## History

Originally, the ABA Economics of Law Practice Section, the predecessor of the ABA Law Practice Division, published *Legal Economic News* a four-page newsletter, but with an expanding audience, the Section Council determined upon a magazine format titled *Legal Economics* in November, 1974. Robert P. Wilkins was instrumental in establishing the new Section magazine and served as its first Editor in Chief. Although an attorney by profession, Wilkins published a regional magazine, *Sandlapper: The Magazine of South Carolina* . Arnold Fisher was Articles Editor and Delmar L. Roberts served as Managing Editor. The first issue of *Legal Economics* appeared in the Spring of 1975 with a press run of 15,000 even though the membership of the Section was significantly less. The additional copies were utilized to promote membership in the Section. By August, 1977, advertisements in *Legal Economics* surpassed those in the ABA Law Student Division's *Student Lawyer*, but trailed those in the ABA Young Lawyers Division's *Barrister* and the *ABA Journal*. By August, 1981, however, advertisements in *Legal Economics* exceeded all but the ABA Journal. The Division magazine is now *Law Practice* and has been considered one of the leading Division benefits by membership and has contributed to the immense growth of the Division.
