## Institute History

1899 – John B. Laidlaw, manager of the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society in Canada, contacted insurance managers across Canada to create an insurance institute in Canada like the institutes being formed in Great Britain in the late 1870s. Two hundred and thirty industry representatives responded, forming to the Insurance Institute of Toronto.

1900 – The Insurance Institute of Montreal formed.

1920s – The Insurance Institute of British Columbia and the Insurance Institute of Winnipeg were established.

1931 – President of the Insurance Institute of Toronto, W.H. Burgess, first raised the idea of a national institute.

1947 – The Insurance Institute of Toronto became the Insurance Institute of Ontario.

1952 – All institutes joined in association with The Insurance Institute of Canada to establish a uniform standard of insurance education and examinations. The first president of the Insurance Institute, Norman G. Bethune, outlined the following three major objectives for the organization in the President's Address to The First Annual Meeting of the Insurance Institute of Canada:

* The standardization of insurance education across Canada, with a uniform syllabus, uniform examinations, and consequently equal standing for all graduates regardless of education.
* A sound and equitable basis of company support of Insurance Institute work.
* To provide means of insurance education in other parts of Canada where it is needed.

As initially stated in the resolutions establishing The Insurance Institute of Canada, the purpose of the organization was "to co-operate with all organisations, both insurance and educational, in the interests of insurance education, all to the end that the service of the business to the insuring public and to Canada generally will be maintained and enhanced, and the efficiency, progress and general development of the business will be promoted." A contemporary example of co-operating with other industry organizations to further insurance education can be found on the website of the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), a trade organization for Canada's home, auto and business insurers.

1998 – The CIP Society was officially sanctioned and the new designations were approved.

2002 – 50th anniversary celebration for the Insurance Institute.
