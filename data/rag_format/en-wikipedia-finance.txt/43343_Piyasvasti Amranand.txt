During his term as energy minister he implemented wide-ranging reforms in the energy sector, for instance, the end of oil price subsidies and repayment of the oil fund's massive debt accrued by the previous government's subsidy program; implementation of aggressive policies to promote renewable energy (including biofuels), cogeneration and distributed generation; adoption of Euro 4 fuel qualities and introduction of vapour recovery systems for petrol stations; adoption of a number of standards and incentive programs for energy efficiency; awards of a large number of petroleum concessions, issuing of IPP solicitation; conclusion of a number of power purchase agreements for projects in Laos; establishment of a nuclear power program with a target for 4,000 MW of nuclear capacity in 2020-2021; and amendment of a number of energy-related laws.

The most important law passed during his term as energy minister was the Energy Industry Act to establish an independent regulatory body for electricity and natural gas. The law was responsible for saving PTT Public Co, Ltd. from being nationalized in a court case brought against the government and PTT by the Consumers Association.

Piyasvasti joined Thai Airways in October 2009 when the carrier was in financial trouble. He continued to implement the turnaround plan and introduced a long term strategic plan where the financial position of the company was substantially strengthened, embarked on the largest aircraft acquisition and retrofit program ever implemented at Thai Airways, and formed Thai Smile as a first step in competing with low cost airlines.
