Prince Edward Island pound


# Prince Edward Island pound



The **pound** was the currency of Prince Edward Island until 1871. It was divided into 20 *shillings*, each of 12 *pence*. It was replaced by the *dollar* in 1871. Initially sterling coin circulated, together with locally produced coins and paper money.


## Coins

The only coins issued exclusively for Prince Edward Island were issued in 1813. There were two denominations, the 1/– and 5/–. Both were produced by cutting a central plug from a Spanish dollar (8 real) coin. The plug, stamped with a sunburst, made the 1/– piece, whilst the similarly stamped ring made the 5/– piece. Due to its shape, the 5/– coin was known as a holey dollar.


## Banknotes

In 1790, the Island of St. Jean (as Prince Edward Island was then known) issued Treasury notes in denominations of 1/–, 1/6, 2/6, 5/–, 10/–, 20/– and 40/–. A further issue of Treasury notes was made between 1834 and 1870, with denominations of 5/–, 10/–, £1, £2, and £5.

Along with the Treasury notes, two chartered banks issued paper money, the *Bank of Prince Edward Island* which
commenced operations Aug 13, 1854 and the *Union Bank of Prince Edward Island*. However, the pounds issued by these two banks had different values relative to sterling. The Bank of Prince Edward Island issued notes in denominations of 5/–, 10/–, £1, £2 and £5 between 1856 and 1863. This pound unit was worth 13s.4d. sterling and the notes also carried the denomination in sterling (3s.4d., 6s.8d., 13s.4d., £1.6s.8d. and £3.6s.8d.). The Union Bank issued notes between 1864 and 1865 denominated in both dollars (worth 4s.2d.) and sterling. Denominations were $1, $2, $5 and $20 (4s.2d., 8s.4d., £1.0s.10d, £4.3s.4d sterling).
