***Spear's*** (formerly known as ***Spear's WMS*** or ***Spear's Wealth Management Survey***), founded in 2006 by William Cash, is a bimonthly British magazine for high-net-worth individuals and those in the financial service industries. It has been called "the Bible of the banking fraternity" by *GQ* and "a European rival to *Forbes*" by The Evening Standard. Nick Cohen called it "The best portrait I have seen of a world beyond our means and comprehension", in *The Spectator*. Its subscribers include over 30,000 of Europe's decision-makers and wealthy. William Cash, editor-at-large of *Spear's*, has twice won Editor of the Year at the PPA Awards (2007 and 2008). *Spear's* is now published by Progressive Digital Media. The launch in 2006 included publicity from *The Independent*, *The Guardian*, the *Luxist* and *The Times*.

Under Alec Marsh's editorship the magazine has run a series of interviews with high-profile figures including Prince Albert II of Monaco, the former Irish president Mary Robinson, the former Cabinet minister Rory Stewart and Nigel Farage, in which he talked about being hated and his return to politics before the launch of the Brexit party in 2019. In 2017, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, told *Spear's* that the world's rich needed to give more money to charity and good causes in an exclusive interview widely followed elsewhere. In June 2020, Alec Marsh stepped down as editor, becoming editor-at-large, and was succeeded by his deputy editor Edwin Smith.


## History

William Cash, a magazine writer who has also been a foreign correspondent for *The Times* and *The Daily Telegraph*, was *Annabel's Magazine's* contract publisher in 2005, when they published the pilot edition of *Spear's* as a supplement. At that time there was competition for advertisements from "fashion houses and luxury brands" upon which the magazine depended. Cash launched *Spear's Wealth Management Survey* in April 2006 with a targeted audience of "the 30,000 wealthiest, most successful and influential people in the UK: from Rich Listers to royalty; hedge fund managers to serial entrepreneurs; oligarchs to internet moguls; cabinet ministers to Sir Alex Ferguson."

In February 2003, Cash married Ilaria Bulgari, whose father was the vice-chairman of Bulgari, the third largest jewellery company in the world. They divorced in 2007 and Cash sold the magazine for about £1.2 million to Luxury Publishing. Then in 2009 he bought a 67% holding back, with Nectar Capital holding the other shares. Cash is the owner of Upton Cressett Hall, a 16th-century Tudor manor in Shropshire.

In 2015 *Spear's* became available at 250 outlets in London, as well as on subscription.

Freelance writer Alec Marsh, a former *Daily Telegraph* journalist and *Daily Mail* gossip columnist, was appointed editor of *Spear's* in January 2017. Marsh, who is also the author of the Drabble and Harris adventure novels, took over from Christopher Silvester, who was editor in 2016. Silvester took over from longtime former *Spear's* editor, Josh Spero, who left to join the *Financial Times* at the end of 2015.
