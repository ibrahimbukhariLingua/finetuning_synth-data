# Czechoslovak Group



The **Czechoslovak Group** (**CSG**), formerly **Excalibur Group**, is a Czech industrial-technological holding company encompassing over 100 companies with over 10,000 employees worldwide. Headquartered in Prague, CSG operates in several sectors including defense, aerospace, ammunition, automotive, and railway industries. Since January 2018, the owner of the Czechoslovak Group is Michal Strnad, the son of the founder, Jaroslav Strnad.

While bulk of the CSG's operations is based in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, CSG also operates factories in Germany, India, Italy, Serbia, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. In 2023, 72% of CSG's revenue originated from defense-related manufacturing. CSG exported its products to over 70 countries, with 66% of the CSG's revenue realized in NATO-member states. Outside of NATO, the main customers were from Ukraine (23% of CSG's revenue, down from 41% in 2022), Indonesia, Vietnam, and Morocco.


## History

Jaroslav Strnad started his business as a scrapyard owner in 1990s. From early on, Strnad focused his business on dealing with military surplus equipment, which was in extreme oversupply after the fall of the Warsaw pact. In 1995, Jaroslav Strnad founded a family company *Excalibur Army* (later to be renamed to Czechoslovak Group) with less than 20 employees. The newly established company expanded business from scrap dealing also towards refurbishment of military surplus equipment. Gradually, the company started acquiring other businesses focused on rail, radar, truck manufacturing. In 2018, Jaroslav Strand's son Michal took over the company, starting an era of international expansion of its businesses.


## Supplies to Iraq

In 2015, CSG became an important supplier of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles used by the Iraqi Government against the ISIS during the War in Iraq (2013–2017).


## Supplies to Ukraine

CSG has been one of the leading European suppliers of defense and defense-related products to Ukraine. Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a number of Ukrainian arms developments were using Tatra 817 chassis, including 2S22 Bohdana howitzer, Bureviy rocket artillery system and R-360 Neptune cruise missile. Following the invasion, deliveries to Ukraine comprised 41% of CSG's revenue in 2022 and 23% in 2023. CSG's most notable sales to Ukraine include:

* 155mm and 152mm artillery rounds from factories in Slovakia and Spain,
* T-72 Avenger main battle tanks,
* BMP-1 and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles,
* RM 70 Vampire and BM-21 MT STRIGA multiple launch rocket systems,
* DANA M2 and DITA self-propelled howitzers.

## Fiocchi Munizioni Acquisition

CSG acquired a 70% stake in Fiocchi Munizioni, an Italian munitions company. The deal was worth “hundreds of millions of euros” Fiocchi Munizioni’s focus is mainly civilian market.

The acquisition of Fiocchi Munizioni by Czechoslovak Group took over a year, including six months of negotiations with the Fiocchi family and an extended seven-month approval process from CFIUS, delayed by the war.


## Vista Outdoor

In October 2023, CSG announced a deal to purchase ammunition businesses owned by the US company Vista Outdoor in a deal valued at $1.91 billion, pending regulatory approval. Vista's sale to CSG has been protested by senators JD Vance, John Kennedy, representative Clay Higgins and National Sheriffs' Association. Vista Outdoor stockholders approved the sale on 25 November 2024 for the price of $2.23bn.


## Partnerships and Collaborations

CSG works closely with General Dynamics European Land Systems, a Madrid-based manufacturer of ground defence vehicles, eg. Pandur II, and Nexter Systems, a leading French manufacturer of military ground equipment.


### MSM Acquisition

In May 2020, the Slovak MSM Group acquired the Spanish ammunition manufacturer Fábrica de Municiones de Granada (FMG), specialising in large caliber ammunition and missile components. After the deal, FMG continued its existing operations and export-focused production without managerial changes. This acquisition enabled MSM Group to expand into Western European ammunition markets, reinforcing its international presence and supply chain control.


### Radar delivery

The US Army acquired POLR-1 radars, known as ReTwis 5, from Czech company Retia. This technology allows for detecting living organisms through walls and has been used by US special forces. ReTwis 5, offering high portability and UWB radio localization, has also been adopted by police units in Phoenix and San Antonio.


### Training Afghan pilots

The Czechoslovak Group (CSG) partnered with Raytheon to train Afghan pilots and is the only private European operator of Black Hawk helicopters. CSG showcased this capability at the GLOBSEC 2019 Security Forum in Bratislava, emphasizing its support for NATO and the EU.

The forum, attended by key global figures, focused on geopolitical challenges and defense cooperation. CSG’s participation highlighted its industrial focus on international defense collaboration and expertise in advanced military technologies.


### Caesar howitzers

The Czech Republic expanded its military capabilities by ordering an additional ten CAESAR self-propelled howitzers from French company Nexter Systems for EUR 77 million, bringing the total order to 62 units valued over EUR 450 million. This modernization program, replacing outdated DANA howitzers, involves significant collaboration with the Czech defense industry, including Tatra Trucks for chassis integration and Retia for communication systems. The CAESAR howitzers, to be delivered by 2026, will become the Czech armed forces' main artillery system.


### RETIA's collaboration

Israel Aerospace Industries' MMR radars, known for advanced air surveillance and defense capabilities, successfully passed Czech Army military tests. The collaboration with Czech companies RETIA and VTU includes technology transfer for local production and maintenance of the radars. These systems, integrated into NATO frameworks, replace outdated Russian technology and enhance Czech defense infrastructure. The Czech defense industry's involvement constitutes around 30% of the total project value, showcasing significant local contribution and expertise in radar technology development.


### TATRA vehicles

The Belgian Army, in a move to modernize its fleet, awarded DAF a contract for 879 military trucks, comprising both 4x4 and 8x8 vehicles, to be delivered between 2022 and 2025. This EUR 259 million contract includes trucks for various roles, with 40% featuring armored cabs. Additionally, DAF, in collaboration with Tatra Trucks, will provide unique chassis and engines for these vehicles, enhancing their off-road capabilities. The collaboration also ensures local maintenance and support, bolstering Belgium's defense infrastructure and capabilities.

Also, in 2023, Tatra Trucks, in cooperation with Rosenbauer, won a contract to supply 76 fire engines to the German Bundeswehr for forest firefighting. The vehicles, based on the Tatra T815-7 chassis with advanced features, will enhance the Bundeswehr's capabilities in combating forest fires.

Tatra Trucks delivered in 2022 the first Tatra Phoenix truck to the U.S. Army for use in their training grounds in Germany. This three-way all-wheel drive tipper truck is part of a broader engagement of Tatra Trucks with various world armies.
