## History

The company was founded in June 1999 by Tarek Sherif, Glen de Vries and Ed Ikeguchi. In 1994, de Vries and Ikeguchi created OceanTek, a startup that developed Web applications for conducting clinical trials and was the precursor to Medidata. In 1999, they restarted the company as a new firm and, together with Sherif, formed Medidata, to provide online systems for designing and running clinical trials. In 2004, they completed a $10 million round of financing with Insight Venture Partners, and were later backed by investors including Milestone Venture Partners and Stonehenge Capital Fund. Ikeguchi left the company in 2008, and de Vries moved from chief technology officer to president, with Tarek as chief executive officer.

On January 26, 2009, Medidata filed to raise $86 million in an initial public offering (IPO). It made its IPO on the Nasdaq Stock Market on June 25, 2009, with its market capitalization at $313 million. It debuted on the Nasdaq at $18 per share. The company was ranked #11 on *Fortune* magazine's 2017 Fortune Future 50 list,#51 on the *Fortune* 100 Fastest Growing Companies list, and #59 on the *Forbes* list of Most Innovative Growth Companies, at a value of $3.3 billion as of May 2017. In 2018, Medidata was ranked #70 on *Barron's* 100 Most Sustainable Companies list.

In December 2019, Medidata was acquired by Dassault Systèmes.
Medidata now functions as a subsidiary.

## Software

Medidata offers a cloud-based platform for clients to build their own clinical trials and perform medical research.

## Legal issues

In September 2014, Medidata discovered that it had been the victim of a fraudulently induced transfer of nearly $4.8 million. The company filed an insurance claim for its loss, which was denied by its insurer, Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb Ltd. The insurer claimed that its policy only covered losses resulting from fraudulent entry or hacking into a computer system and that in this case the transfer was voluntary, while Medidata argued that the thief's actions did come within the policy's definition of covered losses. On July 21, 2017, a federal court in New York ruled that Medidata was entitled to coverage from Federal Insurance for the $4.8 million loss. Federal Insurance's appeal is pending.

On January 26, 2017, Medidata filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York against five former employees and Veeva Systems Inc., in which it accused Veeva of trade secret theft. The complaint alleges that Veeva induced former Medidata employees to reveal confidential information and trade secrets that belong to Medidata. On August 16, 2017, the court denied Veeva's motion to compel arbitration, and on September 20, 2017, Medidata filed its Second Amended Complaint, which names Veeva as the only defendant. The case is ongoing.
