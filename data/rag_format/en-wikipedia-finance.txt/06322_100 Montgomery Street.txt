# 100 Montgomery Street



**100 Montgomery Street**, also known as the **Equitable Life Building**, is an office tower located in the financial district of San Francisco, California. The 354-foot (108Â m), 25-floor tower was completed in 1955 and served as headquarters to the Equitable Life Insurance Company.

Designed by William Peugh, 100 Montgomery Street is one of the first post-World War II office buildings in San Francisco, distinguished by classical white marble facade against aluminum art-deco window framing. It was purchased by developer Hines and its partner Sterling American Property in January 2006 for US$67.5 million from EQ Office. Hines and Sterling sold the building to EQ Office, an affiliate of The Blackstone Group LP, for US$165 million in October 2012, who in turn sold it for a reported $285 million to the Vanbarton Group and a pension fund partner in 2016.
