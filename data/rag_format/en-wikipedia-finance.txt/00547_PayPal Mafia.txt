PayPal Mafia


# PayPal Mafia



The "**PayPal Mafia**" is a group of former PayPal employees and founders who have since founded and/or developed additional technology companies based in Silicon Valley, such as Tesla, Inc., LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, Affirm, Slide, Kiva, YouTube, Yelp, and Yammer. Most of the members attended Stanford University or University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign at some point in their studies.


## History

Originally, PayPal was a money-transfer service offered by a company called Confinity, which merged with X.com in 1999. Later, X.com was renamed PayPal and purchased by eBay in 2002. The original PayPal employees had difficulty adjusting to eBay's more traditional corporate culture and within four years all but 12 of the first 50 employees had left. They remained connected as social and business acquaintances, and a number of them worked together to form new companies and venture firms in subsequent years. This group of PayPal alumni became so prolific that the term *PayPal Mafia* was coined. The term gained even wider exposure when a 2007 article in *Fortune* magazine used the phrase in its headline and featured a photo of former PayPal employees in gangster attire.

## Legacy

The PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the dot-com bust of 2001. The PayPal Mafia phenomenon has been compared to the founding of Intel in the late 1960s by engineers who had earlier founded Fairchild Semiconductor after leaving Shockley Semiconductor. They are discussed in journalist Sarah Lacy's book *Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good.* According to Lacy, the selection process and technical learning at PayPal played a role, but the main factor behind their future success was the confidence they gained there. Their success has been attributed to their youth; the physical, cultural, and economic infrastructure of Silicon Valley; and the diversity of their skill sets. PayPal's founders encouraged tight social bonds among its employees, and many of them continued to trust and support one another after leaving PayPal. An intensely competitive environment and a shared struggle to keep the company solvent despite many setbacks also contributed to a strong and lasting camaraderie among former employees.


## Politics

Some members of the group, such as Peter Thiel, David O. Sacks and Elon Musk, later expressed libertarian and conservative political views. (By contrast, Reid Hoffman has regularly been a top donor for many Democratic campaigns and political pushes.)

After the 2024 United States presidential election, *The Economist* wrote that ⁣⁣the PayPal Mafia would "take over America's government" with the reelection of Donald Trump. Thiel protégé JD Vance became Trump's Vice President, while Musk became head of the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Sacks became Trump's advisor on AI and cryptocurrencies. Musk alone had previously donated over $250 million to Trump's re-presidential campaign.
