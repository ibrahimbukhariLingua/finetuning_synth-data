Financial Modeling World Cup


# Financial Modeling World Cup



The **Financial Modeling World Cup** (**FMWC**) is an organization that hosts various Microsoft Excel based competitions.

The FMWC held its first competition in September 2020 and currently hosts three competitions:

* Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC)
* Microsoft Excel World Championship (MEWC)
* Microsoft Excel Collegiate Challenge (MECC)

## Financial Modeling World Cup (FMWC)


### Description, Competition Format, and Scoring

FMWC is an annual Excel modeling competition.

During the course of a season (January through November), competitors complete eight stages, and are allotted two hours over a 48-hour window to complete each stage.

Each stage contains three case studies, one to five pages long, with multiple choice or fill-in questions at the end. Contrary to what the name suggests, not all case studies are financial modeling based; Many are business modeling or data modeling based.

Stage points are available for:

* Task: Correctly solving questions on each case (Points vary by question)
* Time: Completing the stage early (10 points per minute, awarded only if the competitor has scored 900 task points)

Each stage winner's score is normalized to 1,000 points, and the score of all other competitors are normalized accordingly.

FMWC rankings and final standings are based on points scored across each competitor's top 6 stages (bottom 2 stages are dropped).


### Format Changes

* 2020: The first of four FMWC stages started in September 2020. All stages contributed to the final standings.
* 2021: The stage count increased to twelve. The bottom two stages for each competitor were dropped from the final standings.
* 2022: The stage count decreased to eight. Case authors can not score a higher time bonus than any other player. Stage score normalization was introduced. The prize for top company was eliminated.
* 2023: For each stage, case authors may not score more points than the best player playing full-time.
* 2024: Case authors write cases for an entire stage and are automatically awarded 1,000 points for that stage. They can create cases for no more than 1 stage and are ineligible for prize money in the Stage where their cases are used.

## Microsoft Excel World Championship (MEWC)


### 2021

The MEWC began in 2021 as the FMWC Open, an Excel Esports tournament. The competition was a standalone event that did not impact the Financial Modeling World Cup Rankings in regular seasons.

The tournament consisted of a Qualification Round, with the top 128 qualifiers advancing to a single elimination tournament.

Qualification rounds began on November 13, and continued into December. The last three rounds of the FMWC Open competition were held on December 11, 2021, and were broadcast on FMWC YouTube channel and ESPN3. Andrew Ngai (now representing Australia), Anup Agarwal (India), and Michael Jarman (Canada) returned as quarterfinals qualifiers, and Harry Gross from the UK, Jason Moore from the US, Joseph Palisoc from the US, Sameer Jagetia from the US, and Tim Roberts from the UK also qualified. The final round, entitled "Knights and Warriors", had contestants, each representing a fictional nation, send fictional warriors to conquer each other. Ngai defeated Jarman 734â€“280, with a maximum of 1,000 points per side.


### 2022

The FMWC Open was rebranded as the Microsoft Excel World Championship (MEWC). Like its predecessor, it also consisted of a Qualification Round, with the top 128 qualifiers advancing to a single elimination tournament.


#### Qualification results (Top 50)

In total, 377 people took part and 128 qualified for the final round. The best ranked participants of the FMWC ranking, were prequalified.

**2024**

In front of 400 spectators, Michael Jarman unseated three-time champion Andrew Ngai ("the Annihilator") in December 2024 in Las Vegas. Ngai was described as the Kobe Bryant of Excel, in comparison to Diarmuid Early, who was compared to LeBron James. One spectator described the competition as the "Super Bowl for Excel nerds" and declared that "you'd never get this level of passion" with Google Sheets.
