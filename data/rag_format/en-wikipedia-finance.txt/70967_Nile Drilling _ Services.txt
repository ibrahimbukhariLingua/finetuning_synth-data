Nile Drilling & Services


# Nile Drilling & Services



**Nile Drilling & Services** is South Sudanâ€™s first locally owned and run petroleum drilling company.


## History

When Sudan and South Sudan split in 2011, the countries signed a *Cooperation Agreement*. The two countries agreed that facilities in the south would remain in the South Sudan and those in the north will be owned by Sudan. The rigs inherited in the oilfields of South Sudan were said to be old and needed to be decommissioned.

Nilepet founded **Nile Drilling** as a joint venture national oil company in 2017, 6 years after South Sudan became independent. The recently established company will receive its first workover rig in 2017, with more workover rigs and drilling rigs on order for 2018.
