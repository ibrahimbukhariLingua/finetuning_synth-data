Each adult counts as one person while the first two children count as half each. From the third child onwards each child counts as one person. Therefore, a household comprising 2 adults and 3 children is considered to be a household of 4 persons for tax purposes.

The rates below do not include the 17% social security contributions.

| Annual income above | Annual income below | Tax rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| €0 | €5,963 | 0% |
