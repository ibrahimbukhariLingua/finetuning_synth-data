## Historic building

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building is a bank building located at 160 W. Fort Street in Detroit, Michigan.
The building was constructed in 1927 in a Classical Revival style.
In 1951, the bank added an eight-story glass-and-marble annex, designed by Minoru Yamasaki. The Modern annex is clearly designed not to mimic the original building, but to make a statement all its own.

In 2004, the Federal Reserve Bank moved to its new building on Warren Avenue, leaving the building on Fort empty. A developer purchased the building with the intention of creating loft space.

In July 2011, Quicken Loans representatives were visiting the building, leading to speculation that Dan Gilbert would purchase the space. Gilbert announced the purchase on January 30, 2012.

In February 2014, the Detroit Media Partnership, parent of the *Detroit Free Press* and *The Detroit News*, announced all three organizations would occupy six floors in both the old and new sections of the building. The partnership anticipated completing the move before September and expected to place a sign on the exterior.


## Money Smart Week

The Detroit Branch currently coordinates the annual Michigan Money Smart Week. Coordinated by the Detroit Branch, partner organizations and the Money Smart Advisory Council (MAC), Money Smart Week is designed to promote financial literacy and provide greater personal finance education to consumers.
