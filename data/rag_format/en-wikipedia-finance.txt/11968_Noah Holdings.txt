## Controversies

In 2017, products managed by Gopher Asset Management had exposure to China Huishan Dairy Holdings Co., which collapsed after being targeted by short sellers. A Shanghai court agreed to freeze the company's assets worth $79 million at the request of Gopher Asset Management.

In June 2018, the Securities and Futures Commission fined the Hong Kong unit of Noah $640,000 for inadequate controls related to know your customer, due diligence and other requirements during the period January 2014 to June 2016.

As a result, shares of Noah declined by over 25% in that week as critics accused the company of failing to conduct proper due diligence. Following the losses, Noah dropped offering of non-standard assets and focused only on investments based on publicly traded securities like stocks and bonds.

In March 2023, in response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Noah stated its business operations were not materially affected.
