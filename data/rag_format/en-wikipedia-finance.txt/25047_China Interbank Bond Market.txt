China Interbank Bond Market


# China Interbank Bond Market



The **China Interbank Bond Market** (CIBM) (Chinese: 银行间债券市场) is the largest domestic bond market in China and, as of 2022, is the second-largest in the world, only trailing the United States bond market. The CIBM has over US$21.5 trillion in outstanding volume as of the end of 2022. The CIBM was formed in 1997 after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) mandated commercial banks to move their bond trading out of the stock exchanges and into an interbank market operating through an electronic trading system.

The CIBM has grown rapidly since its inception. Average daily turnover has increased by over 400% in the past 12 years. In 2016 for the first time, medium and long-term qualified foreign institutional investors recognized by People's Bank of China were allowed to invest in the CIBM without quota limits. And in March 2022, overseas institutional investors made up 2.9 percent of the outstanding volume of bonds under custody in CIBM.
