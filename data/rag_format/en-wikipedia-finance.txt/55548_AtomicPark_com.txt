## History

In 2001, when credit card numbers were stolen from the company, AtomicPark.com reported it to the FBI.

In 2006, AtomicPark.com increased its product line from software to video games, computer hardware, and consumer electronics. The same year the company was listed in the "Top 500 Guide" by *InternetRetailer.com*.

In March 2007, AtomicPark.com's banking institution called the loan it had made to the company, sweeping all cash from the company's bank accounts. This resulted in vendors and employees not getting paid and led to the reduction of the workforce to four employees. The company had employed nearly 40 employees during its peak.

In 2007, Microsoft sued the company in federal court, claiming that AtomicPark.com had been selling unauthorized versions of its software since 2000. The company was ordered to pay $1.2â€‚million to Microsoft for selling counterfeit software.
