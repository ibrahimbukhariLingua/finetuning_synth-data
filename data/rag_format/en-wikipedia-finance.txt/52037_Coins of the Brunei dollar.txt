Coins of the Brunei dollar


# Coins of the Brunei dollar



The **coins of the Brunei dollar** are part of the physical form of current Brunei currency, the Brunei dollar. They have changed through time along with Brunei itself. A British protectorate from 1888 until 1983, it is currently an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations.


## First Series

The decision was taken to adopt a native Bruneian currency called the Brunei dollar (or *ringgit Brunei* in Malay), which is divided into 100 cents (or *sen* in Malay). The portrait of the then Sultan, Omar Ali Saifuddin III (ruled 1950–1967), is depicted on the obverse. The reverse of these coins, and all subsequent series, was designed by Christopher Ironside OBE. The coins issued were 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 sen.
