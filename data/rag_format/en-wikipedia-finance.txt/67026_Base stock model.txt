Base stock model


# Base stock model



The **base stock model** is a statistical model in inventory theory. In this model inventory is refilled one unit at a time and demand is random. If there is only one replenishment, then the problem can be solved with the newsvendor model.


## Overview


### Assumptions

1. Products can be analyzed individually
2. Demands occur one at a time (no batch orders)
3. Unfilled demand is back-ordered (no lost sales)
4. Replenishment lead times are fixed and known
5. Replenishments are ordered one at a time
6. Demand is modeled by a continuous probability distribution

### Variables

* {\displaystyle L} = Replenishment lead time
* {\displaystyle X} = Demand during replenishment lead time
* {\displaystyle g(x)} = probability density function of demand during lead time
* {\displaystyle G(x)} = cumulative distribution function of demand during lead time
* {\displaystyle \theta } = mean demand during lead time
* {\displaystyle h} = cost to carry one unit of inventory for 1 year
* {\displaystyle b} = cost to carry one unit of back-order for 1 year
* {\displaystyle r} = reorder point
* {\displaystyle SS=r-\theta }, safety stock level
* {\displaystyle S(r)} = fill rate
* {\displaystyle B(r)} = average number of outstanding back-orders
* {\displaystyle I(r)} = average on-hand inventory level

## Fill rate, back-order level and inventory level

In a base-stock system inventory position is given by on-hand inventory-backorders+orders and since inventory never goes negative, inventory position=r+1. Once an order is placed the base stock level is r+1 and if Xâ‰¤r+1 there won't be a backorder. The probability that an order does not result in back-order is therefore:

{\displaystyle P(X\leq r+1)=G(r+1)}

Since this holds for all orders, the fill rate is:

{\displaystyle S(r)=G(r+1)}

If demand is normally distributed {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}(\theta ,\,\sigma ^{2})}, the fill rate is given by:

{\displaystyle S(r)=\phi \left({\frac {r+1-\theta }{\sigma }}\right)}

Where {\displaystyle \phi ()} is cumulative distribution function for the standard normal. At any point in time, there are orders placed that are equal to the demand X that has occurred, therefore on-hand inventory-backorders=inventory position-orders=r+1-X. In expectation this means:

{\displaystyle I(r)=r+1-\theta +B(r)}

In general the number of outstanding orders is X=x and the number of back-orders is:

{\displaystyle Backorders={\begin{cases}0,&x<r+1\\x-r-1,&x\geq r+1\end{cases}}}

The expected back order level is therefore given by:

{\displaystyle B(r)=\int \_{r}^{+\infty }\left(x-r-1\right)g(x)dx=\int \_{r+1}^{+\infty }\left(x-r\right)g(x)dx}

Again, if demand is normally distributed:

{\displaystyle B(r)=(\theta -r)[1-\phi (z)]+\sigma \phi (z)}

Where {\displaystyle z} is the inverse distribution function of a standard normal distribution.


## Total cost function and optimal reorder point

The total cost is given by the sum of holdings costs and backorders costs:

{\displaystyle TC=hI(r)+bB(r)}

It can be proven that:

Where r\* is the optimal reorder point.

| Proof |
| --- |
| {\displaystyle {\frac {dTC}{dr}}=h+(b+h){\frac {dB}{dr}}} {\displaystyle {\frac {dB}{dr}}={\frac {d}{dr}}\int \_{r+1}^{+\infty }(x-r-1)g(x)dx=-\int \_{r+1}^{+\infty }g(x)dx=-[1-G(r+1)]} To minimize TC set the first derivative equal to zero: {\displaystyle {\frac {dTC}{dr}}=h-(b+h)[1-G(r+1)]=0} And solve for G(r+1). |

If demand is normal then r\* can be obtained by:

{\displaystyle r^{\*}+1=\theta +z\sigma }
