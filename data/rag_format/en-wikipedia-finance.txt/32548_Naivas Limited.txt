**Naivas Supermarket**, often referred to simply as "Naivas", is the largest supermarket chain in Kenya, with 106 outlets as of November 2024. At that time, Naivas was the largest supermarket chain in Kenya, ahead of Quick Mart Limited with 51 outlets in the country.


## Location

The company headquarters, as well as the company's warehouses, are located in Sameer Business Park, in the *Industrial Area* of Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. The coordinates of the headquarters of Naivas Limited are: 01°19'36.0"S, 36°52'04.0"E (Latitude:-1.326667; Longitude:36.867779).


## Overview

Naivas is headquartered in Nairobi, with retail outlets in many urban centres in the country. In July 2018, the company hired Andreas von Paleske, as an advisor to assist the business with its strategy and operations. This culminated in bringing African private equity firm Amethis on board for a minority stake. At that time, Naivas Limited maintained 47 stores in Kenya. The supermarket chain opened its 53rd store in Kenya in July 2019 at Rongai, Nakuru County, with plans to open two more, the same year.


## History

Naivas Limited was registered on 24 July 1990. It previously traded as Rongai Self Service Stores Limited, serving mainly in Rongai in Nakuru County. The company name was changed later to Naivasha Self Service Stores Limited, before re-branding to the current Naivas Limited, in 2007.

In August 2013, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Massmart, a subsidiary of retail giant Walmart, offered to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Naivas at a cost of KSh3 billion, giving Massmart a controlling interest in the retail chain. The bid triggered a feud at family-owned Naivas, and some family members asked a court to block the sale. In October 2013, Naivas management stated that they were no longer selling a controlling stake to Massmart. On 16 July 2014, Naivas opened a store in Garissa, making it the first major retailer to open an outlet in the town. This was Naivas' 31st branch in Kenya.


## Ownership

Naivas Limited is a privately owned company, whose shares are majorly held by the descendants of its founder Peter Mukuha Kago, who died on 6 May 2010.
