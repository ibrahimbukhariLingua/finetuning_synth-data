Access to Medicine Index


# Access to Medicine Index



The **Access to Medicine Index** is a ranking system published biennially since 2008 by the Access to Medicine Foundation, an international not-for-profit organisation based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It ranks 20 of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies according to their ability to make their pharmaceutical drugs more available, affordable and accessible in low- and middle-income countries. The Index aims to stimulate companies to improve access in developing countries, to show the activities of their peers, and allow them, governments, investors, civil society, patient organisations and academia to understand how pharmaceutical companies can make further progress. The 2024 Access to Medicine Index was funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, Axa Investment Managers, Stewart Investors and the Wellcome Trust.

## History

The Access to Medicine Index was developed starting in 2004 on the initiative of Dutch entrepreneur Wim Leereveld. After years of working with the pharmaceutical industry, he concluded that simply "naming and shaming" the industry did not do enough to encourage pharmaceutical companies to play their part in improving access to medicine in the developing world. Leereveld noticed that there were many different (and sometimes conflicting) opinions about what the pharmaceutical industry should be doing with regard to access to medicine, but that there was no tool to recognise good practice within the pharmaceutical industry and no framework for collective dialogue surrounding this issue. He set out to develop a ranking system that would show which pharmaceutical companies do the most to improve access to medicine and how, and also help stakeholders to collectively define companies' role in increasing access to medicine.

The first Access to Medicine Index was published in 2008, followed by new Indexes in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2024.
