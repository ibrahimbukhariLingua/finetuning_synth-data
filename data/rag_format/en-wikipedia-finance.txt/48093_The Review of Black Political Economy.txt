## History


### Background and founding

Robert S. Browne decided to create *The Review of Black Political Economy* in order to create "an hospitable arena in which black people could explore ideas as to how they might bring about effective and substantial improvement in their collective economic position." It became a platform for people to publish articles and commentaries on the conditions of black people in the United States from an economic and sociological standpoint. Initially the Review was a product of the Black Economic Research Center (BERC) which Robert Browne founded and ran until 1976. After that, ownership was transferred to the National Economic Association.

Browne chose the term "Political Economy" rather than economics for the title because he felt that "in America at least, for people to effect any significant alteration in their economic position, they will first be obliged to develop a sound political strategy." The initial aim of *The Review* was to provide a mixture of scholarly and non-scholarly articles which would appeal to a wide range of readers - but Robert S. Browne admitted that this was an ambitious undertaking. Early issues of the journal included a mix of articles by scholars and practitioners. Graduate students were encouraged to submit their research for publication.

The first issue of *The Review* included seven articles: "Outputs of Minority Entrepreneurship Programs" (Glenn Dixon); "Toward an Overall Assessment of Our Alternatives" (Robert S. Browne); "The Myth and Irrationality of Black Capitalism" (James Boggs); "The Black Manifesto" (James Forman and Others); "What Do You People Want?" (Richard F. America); "The Basic Economics of the Urban and Racial Crisis" (Daniel R. Fusfeld); and "Brimmer and Black Capitalism: An Analysis (Charles Tate). There were also four book reviews in the first issue : "Black Capitalism: Strategy for Business in the Ghetto by Theodore L. Cross" (Thaddeus Spratlen, reviewer); "Race and Poverty: The Economics of Discrimination" edited by John F. Kain (Charles Z. Wilson, reviewer); "The Tenement Landlord by George Sternlieb" (Robert S. Browne, reviewer); and "Poverty and Discrimination by Lester C. Thurlow" (John Handy, reviewer).

## Effectiveness

Research has been conducted to ascertain whether *The Review of Black Political Economy* has had a noticeable effect on the number and contributions of Black economists. *The Review of Black Political Economy* was started with a few core values in mind, providing a platform for scholars to discuss socioeconomic topics such as discrimination and poverty as they relate to Black populations. Results from a bibliometric analysis indicate that the academic standing of Black economists has been improved due to the existence of *The Review of Black Political Economy*, and the original issues the journal formed to address have seen some improvement. These findings imply a 'plausible counterfactual,' meaning that a lack of existence of the journal would result in a lower overall scholarly status for Black economists in the profession. One example of this in the literature is the publications released under two female Black editors, Margaret Simms and Cecilia Conrad. By having these two serve as the first two Black female journal editors, more academic involvement was encouraged and inspired within the field and demographic, and this was facilitated by *The Review of Black Political Economy*.
