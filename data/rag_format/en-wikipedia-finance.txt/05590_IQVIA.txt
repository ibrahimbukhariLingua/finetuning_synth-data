## Controversies

Throughout its history, the legacy IMS Health's business of collecting anonymized pharmaceutical sales data came under scrutiny from both the media and the legal system.

*IMS Health v. Ayotte* was a free speech case involving IMS Health.

*Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.* was a case about physician-data privacy, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The High Court ruled in favor of the company.

IQVIA was contracted by the UK government's Office of National Statistics to provide data on the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the population. Some users of the survey reported problems contacting IQVIA and arranging for testing. The problems with how the survey results were collected were criticised for potentially leading to biased data by *New Scientist*.

On July 17, 2023, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block IQVIA’s acquisition of Propel Media alleging in an administrative complaint that the acquisition would give IQVIA a market-leading position in health care programmatic advertising and would raise health-care prices for consumers. In December 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Edgardo Ramos issued an order granting the FTC’s motion for preliminary injunction to block the merger. Speaking in favor of the FTC, Ramos said, "The FTC has shown that there is a reasonable probability that the proposed acquisition will substantially impair competition in the relevant market and that the equities weigh in favor of injunctive relief." An administrative trial was scheduled to start on January 18, 2024. However, on January 5, 2024, IQVIA and Propel Media announced that they had mutually agreed to abandon the proposed merger.
