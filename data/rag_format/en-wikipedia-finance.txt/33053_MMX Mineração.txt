## Superporto Sudeste

The Superporto Sudeste is a mega private port terminal mixed-use, dedicated to the movement of iron ore, which is being built on the island of Madeira, in the municipality of Itaguaí, in Rio de Janeiro state. Strategically located, the Southeast Superport represents the shortest distance between the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais and the sea. The construction of the project was initiated in July 2010 and is expected to begin operation in 2014.

With the start of operations in Southeast Superport, MMX entire production is exported. The transportation of iron ore from mine to port, is guaranteed by the MRS, the railroad that connects the Iron Quadrangle in Minas Gerais to Itaguaí, in Rio de Janeiro, where the MMX builds Superporto Sudeste. Mubadala Trafigura took over the control of the company owning the port (Porto Sudeste do brasil SA) in October 2013 by buying 65% of it, to reduce debt of the company.
