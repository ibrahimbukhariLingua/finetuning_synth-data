He served as acting Secretary-General of FIFA from September 2015 to May 2016, but was dismissed without notice after being accused of paying himself bonuses worth millions of US Dollars during a previous stint as FIFA's director of Finance. Markus Kattner has begun legal proceedings against FIFA before the competent court in Zurich as he believes his dismissal to be unjustified. The Zurich High Court ruled in Markus Kattner's favour and decided in its ruling of 4 October 2022 that his dismissal without notice was unjustified. In his complaint, Kattner claimed that "the reasons for his dismissal were pretextual and inaccurate".
