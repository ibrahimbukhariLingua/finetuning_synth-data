The **Ministry of Entrepreneurship, Microenterprise and Small Business** (Portuguese: *Ministério do Empreendedorismo, da Microempresa e da Empresa de Pequeno Porte*) is a cabinet-level federal ministry in Brazil. It is an institution previously created in 2013 as the **Secretariat of Micro and Small Business of the Presidency** (Portuguese: *Secretaria da Micro e Pequena Empresa da Presidência da República*), a cabinet-level secretariat under the responsibility of the Presidency of the Republic from 2013 to 2015. It was dissolved after a ministry shuffle in October 2015. Since then, it became part of the Secretariat of Government of the Presidency, without a ministry status.
