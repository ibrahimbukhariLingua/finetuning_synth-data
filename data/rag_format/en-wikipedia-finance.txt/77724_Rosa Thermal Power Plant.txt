Rosa Power Supply Company Limited (RPSCL), the holding company of Rosa Power Plant, was incorporated on 1 September 1994 as a subsidiary of Aditya Birla Power Company. It was later transferred to Reliance Power on 1 November 2006 and is now a fully owned subsidiary of Reliance Power. It is a project that has received a considerable support from the Uttar Pradesh government with it being designated a 'priority project'. The entire power generated will be sold to the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL). The tariff for the power generated by the plant will be determined in accordance with the guidelines for tariff as set by Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The construction for the Phase I of the project began in June 2007 and by December 2009 the first unit of the project had started generating power. The Boiler, Turbine and Generator (BTG) which are the main equipments for the plant were supplied by Shanghai Electric Corporation, China.

The project uses coal as the primary fuel. The coal for the project would be supplied from the Ashoka Coal mines of Central Coalfields Limited, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited. The coal mines are located in Jharkhand and the coal will be transported by Railways over a distance of 870 km.

The power generated from the plant will be evacuated using the UP state's transmission network.

The water required for the power plant is sourced from Garrah river located a kilometer from the project
