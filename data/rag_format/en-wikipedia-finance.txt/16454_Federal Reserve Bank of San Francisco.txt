## History

The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank opened for business in rented quarters at the rear of the Merchants National Bank on November 16, 1914, in order to make the reserve provisions of the Federal Reserve Act. In 1924, the San Francisco staff moved out of temporary locations and into the Bank's newly built headquarters at 400 Sansome Street, a location that it would occupy for the next 60 years. In 1983, the bank relocated to 101 Market Street.


### Branches

After the bank's creation, a number of branches were opened to provide services across the district.

* Spokane branch (opened July 26, 1917; closed 1938)
* Seattle branch (opened September 19, 1917)
* Portland branch (opened October 1, 1917; ceased cash operations 2005; currently a depot site)
* Salt Lake City branch (opened April 1, 1918)
* Los Angeles branch (opened January 2, 1920)

Although not a stand-alone branch, the bank opened the Phoenix Cash Processing Center in 2001.


## Buildings

The old headquarters building of the bank, designed by George W. Kelham, has an Ionic colonnade that is pure Beaux-Arts, while the upper building is in the new Moderne fashion of 1924. The lobby with murals by Jules Guerin who created the palette for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exhibition. In 1983 the bank relocated to larger and more modern facilities on 101 Market Street as the 400 Sansome Street location was sold to private developers who rented out the space. Prominent law firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe was headquartered in the building until 2002 when the firm moved out of the space. The building continues to be owned by private developers and current tenants include the Bar Association of San Francisco. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

The 1929 Los Angeles branch building is also NRHP-listed.

From 1951 to 2008, the Seattle branch was headquartered at the Federal Reserve Bank Building in Downtown Seattle, which had been built in 1951 for the branch and is listed on the NRHP.
