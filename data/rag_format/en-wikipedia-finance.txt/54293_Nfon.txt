## History

Marcus Otto, Mathias Edelmann and Fabian Hoppe founded the company in March 2007. Against the backdrop of the increasing popularity of Internet telephony, the founders developed a telephone system as a pure software product based on the free software Asterisk. This meant that smaller companies could also afford functions that had previously only been available in telephone systems from large companies. In addition to landline telephones, Laptops and mobile phones could also be integrated. The number of customers rose from 1,000 to around 12,000 between mid-2008 and mid-2009.

At the end of 2009, the company expanded into Austria and founded NFON GmbH, a joint venture with ipefon (based in Sankt PÃ¶lten), for this purpose. NFON attracted venture capital investors through several rounds of financing. The funds also contributed to further expansion into other European countries; at the beginning of 2015, NFON was represented in twelve countries. In 2016, Deutsche Telekom and NFON agreed on a cooperation to accelerate the transition of medium-sized companies from ISDN to Internet telephony and virtual telephone systems. The company went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on May 11, 2018. At that time, the company had 150 employees serving more than 15,000 corporate customers in 13 European countries. Italy and France were added as further countries in 2019. NFON also acquired Deutsche Telefon Standard AG in spring 2019 and Onwerk GmbH a year later.
