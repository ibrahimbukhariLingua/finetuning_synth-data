# CEIBA Intercontinental



**CEIBA Intercontinental** is an airline headquartered in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, and based at Malabo International Airport.


## History

In 2009, the Agence France Press (AFP) reported that the CEO of CEIBA Intercontinental Mamadou Jaye, a Senegalese citizen of Gambian origin, left Equatorial Guinea with a suitcase containing 3.5 billion CFA francs (approximately 5 million euros or 6.5 million United States dollars) and spare ATR aircraft parts to negotiate trade deals with Côte d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, and Senegal and to establish a West African office for CEIBA. The report said that Jaye never returned to Equatorial Guinea. Jaye denied that he took money from the company and filed a lawsuit against Rodrigo Angwe, the Malabo-based correspondent for Agence France Presse and Radio France Internationale (RFI) who submitted the story. Angwe used an employee as a source; the employee said that he received the information from the internet. After the employee's admission, AFP and RFI retracted the story. Jaye accused Angwe of publishing the internet article himself.

It continues to operate regional and internal flights.

In 2022 it was announced the company would be privatised. In 2024 CEIBA was discussing selling a stake in the company to Ethiopian Airlines after an official expression of interest CEIBA is one among a number of state businesses due to be sold off under a 2019 IMF deal.

## Accidents and incidents

CEIBA Intercontinental had two notable aviation accidents involving Boeing 737s:

* 5 September 2015 – a Boeing 737-800, operating as Flight 071 from Dakar to Cotonou, collided with a HS-125 air ambulance flying from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to Dakar, Senegal. The Boeing 737 diverted to Malabo where it landed safely. The air ambulance apparently suffered a decompression incident and is believed to have crashed in the Atlantic Ocean.
* 29 August 2024 – the same as aircraft as above, now registered in Ethiopia as ET-AWR, was operating as Flight 205, from Bata Airport, Equatorial Guinea to Malabo, overran the runway after landing in heavy rain. The aircraft was substantially damaged, but all passengers and crew were evacuated via the emergency slides injury-free.
