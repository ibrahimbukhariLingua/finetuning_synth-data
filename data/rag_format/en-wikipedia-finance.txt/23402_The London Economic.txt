Its scepticism of the mainstream media has given it an alternative media tag, one shared by political blogs such as *The Canary*, music bands such as *Captain SKA* and websites such as *Novara Media*.

In June 2017, Peat joined Matt Turner of *Evolve Politics*, Stephen Glover of the *Daily Mail*, Aaron Bastani of *Novara Media*, Michael Heaver of *Westmonster*, Eve Pollard and David Yelland to discuss whether Britain's newspapers have lost their influence on British politics.
