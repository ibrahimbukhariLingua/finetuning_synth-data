## Overview

## History

The bank was founded in 1984 as **Family Finance Building Society Limited**. Titus Muya, the former non-executive chairman of Family Bank served as the founding chairman and chief executive officer for the first twenty-three years of the organisation. In 2007, it became a commercial bank, following the issuance of a banking license by the Central Bank of Kenya, the country's banking regulator. Titus Muya resigned as CEO of the re-branded **Family Bank Limited**, to comply with current Kenyan banking regulations. Since converting to a commercial bank, FBL has been pursuing an expansion of its branch network.

In 2010, the bank diversified into the insurance industry through a subsidiary Dhamana Insurance Agency.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2013, the bank acquired a building in central Nairobi that serves as its headquarters and is currently undergoing renovation to carry its corporate image. This is the same building where founder Mr. TK Muya had rented a small space that served as both a branch and his office.


## Ownership

The shares of stock of FBL are privately owned by institutional and individual investors. In October 2010, a consortium consisting of private equity firm AfricInvest, based in Tunisia, FMO of the Netherlands and Norway's Norfund, acquired a 25% stake in Family Bank for a cash sum of US$14.3 million.
