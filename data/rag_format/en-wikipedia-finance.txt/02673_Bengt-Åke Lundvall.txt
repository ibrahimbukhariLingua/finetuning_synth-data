## Work

Lundvall's research is organized around a broad set of issues related to the innovation system (in fact this concept was created by him in 1985) and the learning economy. During 1992-95 he was Deputy Director at DSTI, OECD. He was involved in the preparation and follow up of the Lisbon Strategy 2000 and onwards. Lundvall has co-ordinated the IKE-group in Aalborg since 1977 and the Danish network DRUID 1996-2001. Since 2002 he coordinates the worldwide research network Globelics.

In close collaboration with Christopher Freeman, Bengt-Åke Lundvall developed the idea of innovation as an interactive process, in the first half of the eighties and the concept of National System of Innovation in the second half (Lundvall, 1985 and Lundvall, 1988). In the beginning of the nineties he developed the idea of "the learning economy" in collaboration with Björn Johnson (Lundvall and Johnson, 1994).

According to the research carried by Fagerberg & Verspagen (2007) on innovation studies, Lundvall is number 4 in "The most important sources of scholarly inspiration" (only after Schumpeter, Nelson, and Lundvall's mentor Freeman)
