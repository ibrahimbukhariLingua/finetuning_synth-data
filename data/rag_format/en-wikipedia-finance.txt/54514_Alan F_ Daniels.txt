## Career

Daniels previously served as chairman/CEO of venture capital and investment firm, Real Estate Industries from 2000–2002.

He also served as chairman/CEO RealEstate.com from 1997–2000 where he's credited for leading the company from start-up stage to an international business-to-business provider of Web-Based Solutions, with a private valuation in excess of $500M. Daniels raised nearly $100M in venture capital while at the helm of RealEstate.com. Venture investor's included: Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc., J. & W. Seligman & Co., and Fleet Boston, Robertson Stephens. As chairman of the board of RealEstate.com, Daniels assembled a board of directors that included: Steve J. Heyer, former President/COO of Turner Broadcasting System, R. Byron Carlock, former Chief Investment Officer of Post Properties and former Atlanta Mayor, the late Maynard H. Jackson.

While chairman/CEO of RealEstate.com, Daniels spearheaded long-term multi-million dollar revenue agreements with firms such as GMAC, Lycos and Realtor.com. As a result of the rapid revenue growth and business expansion, RealEstate.com was scheduled for an initial public offering (IPO) in Q1 of 2000. Investment banks advising the company included: Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Fleet Boston, Robertson Stephens and A.G. Edwards. Due to the Internet bubble, the firm did not IPO as planned and the company’s valuation declined. Daniels lost an estimated $220M of his net worth within a few months.

In December 2000, the firm’s assets were acquired by existing investor Sand Hill Capital. Daniels and other key executives resigned after disagreeing with Sand Hill plans for the future direction of the firm. Sand Hill changed the firm’s business-to-business model to a consumer-to-business residential website and subsequently sold the firm to Barry Diller’s InterActiveCorp (IAC).
