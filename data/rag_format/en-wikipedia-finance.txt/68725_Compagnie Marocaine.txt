Compagnie Marocaine


# Compagnie Marocaine



***La Compagnie Marocaine*** (the Moroccan Company) was a French colonial holding company founded in 1902 for the purpose of exploiting Morocco.


## History

In 1902, a group of industrialists led by Eugène Schneider II founded the company with the purpose of organizing commercial, industrial, and agricultural activities in Morocco.

Eugène Schneider II was its first president.

The Treaty of Algeciras of 1906, which formalized French preeminence in Morocco and precipitated the establishment of a French protectorate in Morocco, accorded a contract to construct modern ports in Casablanca and Asfi to *Compagnie Marocaine*. In fact, it was an attack on the company's Decauville train that incited the Bombardment of Casablanca in August 1907, marking the beginning of the French conquest of Morocco.

Starting in 1911, in order to secure an increase in capital, the presidency went to a representative of the *Banque de l'Union Parisienne*.

It participated in the creation of the *Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Maroc* (Railroad Company of Morocco) and become a main shareholder.

*La Compagnie Marocaine* was listed in the Paris Bourse in 1920.
