## History

Printronix was founded in 1974 by Robert A. Kleist and business partners Gordon B. Barrus and David Mayne.

Barrus realized there was a capital need for businesses to store all their data via printing, so he quit his job at Data Products and started a company he named Eikon, marketing industrial-grade printers to businesses to fulfill this need. The company was not successful and Gordon regrouped to found the startup Printronix.
In the spring of 1974, in a garage in Playa del Rey, California, seven high technology pioneers got together and started a new company.
They were Gordon Barrus (RIP), Leo Emenaker (RIP), Robert A Kleist, Dave Mayne, Ray Melissa, Rafael Pati√±o and Glen Radke (RIP).
Initially working out of Leo Emenaker's garage in Playa Del Rey, California, Barrus developed and invented what he christened as the **P300**, a 300-line-per-minute (LPM) prototype line printer series.

The company would eventually incorporate, go public on the Nasdaq, and experience great success in the ensuing years with the emergence of the personal computer.
