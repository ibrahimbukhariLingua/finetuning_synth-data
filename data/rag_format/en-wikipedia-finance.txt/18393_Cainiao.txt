## Services


### Cainiao Station

Cainiao operates a network of courier pick-up points known as Cainiao Stations (Chinese: 菜鸟驿站) across the Chinese mainland. These stations are strategically situated in residential neighborhoods and on university campuses, serving functions akin to traditional post offices. When a courier package is destined for a location within a Cainiao Station's service area, it is rerouted to the station and stored there. Recipients are notified to collect their packages, which are organized on numerical shelves and assigned a unique 4-digit code as they enter the station. Customers can locate their package using this code, and after finding it, they scan it at a self-service checkout machine to complete the pickup. Additionally, some Cainiao Stations provide services for sending packages.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
