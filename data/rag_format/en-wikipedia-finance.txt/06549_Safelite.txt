**Safelite Group, Inc.** is an American provider of automotive glass repair and replacement services, wholesale automotive glass sales, along with insurance claims management, based in Columbus, Ohio. Safelite is being sued by the state of California and faces a September 2025 trial for alleged insurance fraud.


## History

Bud Glassman and Art Lankin started Safelite in a junkyard in Wichita, Kansas in 1947.

The company declared bankruptcy in 1997, after which time, the company became owned by its largest creditor, J.P. Morgan & Co.

In 2007, Safelite was acquired by Luxembourg based Belron, which is in turn owned by the D'Ieteren group, Belron is the world's largest vehicle glass company, providing service in over 32 countries.

Thomas Feeney became the president and CEO in 2008. In late 2021, Renee Cachillo became the President and CEO as Thomas Feeney moved into a leadership role for Belron North America.

On 5 January 2023, Safelite and two of its business units were sued for insurance fraud in a lawsuit brought by former SAG product development and strategy manager Brian Williams, on behalf of himself and the people of California. The lawsuit alleges that the company used less expensive universal moldings, but billed insurers for more expensive part-specific units instead. A motion to strike this whistleblower complaint was denied in 2024, and the trial date has been set for September 2025.
