# Madhya Pradesh Stock Exchange



**Madhya Pradesh Stock Exchange** (**MPSE**) was a stock exchange located at Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. It was a SEBI recognized Permanent Stock Exchange, until its de-recognition in 2015. Established in 1919, it was 3rd oldest stock exchange in India, and a leading stock exchange under outcry system.


## History

MPSEL was originally set up as an association in 1919, with around 150 broking members. It was granted permanent recognition under the provisions of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 ("SCRA"), by the Government of India in 1988. MPSEL currently has 185 broker members, including some of the leading brokering houses in India. Around 315 companies, including some of the leading corporates of the country are listed on MPSEL.

After joining hands with National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 2012 and with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in 2013, MPSE became the only regional stock exchange in India to provide independent trading platform for its members.

MPSE was the first regional exchange to enter into agreement with both the stock exchanges and first in India to get SEBI's approval when it allowed regional exchanges to come out of hibernation. Prior to this trading at the MPSE was allowed through its subsidiary.

In 2014, SEBI asked MPSE to create its own trading platform with a net worth of â‚¹ 100 crore or be de-recognized. SEBI de-recognized MPSE in 2015.
