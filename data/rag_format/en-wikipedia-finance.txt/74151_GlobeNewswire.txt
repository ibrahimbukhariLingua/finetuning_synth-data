GlobeNewswire


# GlobeNewswire



**GlobeNewswire** provides press release distribution services globally, with substantial operations in North America and Europe.

GlobeNewswire was a Nasdaq, Inc. subsidiary from September 2006 until April 2018 when West Corporation (now Intrado) acquired the **Public Relations Solutions** and **Digital Media Services** Businesses, including GlobeNewswire, from Nasdaq.

Formerly known as PrimeNewswire, the company changed its name to GlobeNewswire in 2008 to better reflect its international scope.


## History

GlobeNewswire was established in 1998 with the goal of eliminating the 15-minute delay in disclosing financial releases to all media, as well as offering Investor Relations website management services, hosting online customer service centers, and delivering the news via HTML email.

GlobeNewswire facilitates the distribution of corporate press releases, financial disclosures, and multimedia content to various stakeholders, including the media, investment community, individual investors, and the general public.

In 2012, GlobeNewswire introduced its Streaming Media Player, which allows users to alternate between videos and slides while monitoring a variety of news sources.

In June 2018, GlobeNewswire introduced Media Snippets, providing the ability for organizations publishing press releases to embed a carousel of images, audio, video, and live streaming into their press releases and web pages to tell a more complete brand story and increase engagement with media, investors, and customers.


## Notable events

In September 2021, GlobeNewswire published an unconfirmed fake news article that Walmart will accept Litecoin LTC payments. As a result, millions of dollars in crypto exchanges were liquidated. Shortly thereafter, the article was deleted, but the damage had already been done. The article was primarily launched by a possibly hacked LiteCoin Twitter account; alternatively, active assistance to manipulate the market is also conceivable.
