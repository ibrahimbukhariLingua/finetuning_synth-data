## History

InetSoft was co-founded in 1996 by siblings Larry and Luke Liang. Prior to founding InetSoft, Larry Liang, was involved in the early research of e-commerce and interactive Web technologies and served as a research scientist at Bell Communications Research (now Telcordia Technologies), and held various technical positions at Bell Labs, AT&T, and Lucent Technologies. Luke Liang worked for Goldman Sachs in a variety of technology and management positions and held consulting positions with both JP Morgan, Chase and the Union Bank of Switzerland. Both hold master's degrees in Computer Science.

The company began with four employees working out of a garage in Piscataway, New Jersey. It focused on developing an open standards Java-based platform that would be fully compatible with Java/XML, relational databases, internet technologies and legacy systems. Its initial product was Style Report, which focused on reporting and data analysis. Style Report claims to have a small footprint, and has been used in client-side and server-side Java applications. Over the years, InetSoft's products evolved alongside Java to become server-based Web solutions. The product line has grown to include reporting, dashboards and visual analysis.


## Product development history

InetSoft's software is based on open standardsᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ technology that incorporates XML, SOAP, Java language, and JavaScript. While the primary design goal is easy integration with other open standards based software, access to third party proprietary software has been added in recent years. Additionally, the company licenses by CPU rather than by named user. Here is a history of InetSoft product development.
