## History

Zempler Bank was initially a prepaid card operator launched in the UK in 2005 under the name Cashplus. As of 2008, it had become the top prepaid service in Europe using Mastercard credit cards.

It applied for a banking licence in 2017, then transformed into a fully regulated UK bank after acquiring its banking license in 2021, thereby becoming Cashplus Bank.

In July 2024, Cashplus Bank rebranded to Zempler Bank.
