Brian Walker reviewed *Wall Street* for *Games International* magazine, and gave it a rating of 1 out of 10 (a turkey), and stated that "It might be better as a multi player game but it's doubtful. As it stands, *Wall Street* is merely an unusual way of finding out if you have a future as a speed typist."

Brian Carroll for *Game Player's PC Strategy Guide* reviewed the game and said that "*Wall$treet* is fairly complex, presenting a market that reacts to events, dividend expenditures, borrowing, and the fluttering fortunes of the game's players."
