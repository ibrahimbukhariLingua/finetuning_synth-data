Mexico–United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement


# Mexico–United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement



The **Mexico–United Kingdom free trade agreement (MUKFTA)** is a proposed free trade agreement which began negotiations on 20 May 2022. The trade agreement would be the third FTA to cover Mexico–UK trade, superseding the Mexico–UK Trade Continuity Agreement, extending the deal to cover financial, creative, digital, services and digital trade.


## History

From 1 July 2000 until 30 December 2020, trade between Mexico and the United Kingdom was governed by the Mexico–European Union Free Trade Agreement, while the UK was a member of the European Union. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK and Mexico signed a continuity trade agreement on 15 December 2020, based on the EU free trade agreement; the agreement entered into force on 1 June 2021.

On 20 May 2022, Mexico and the United Kingdom announced their intentions start talks on a modernised free trade agreement; the agreement will supersede Mexico–United Kingdom Trade Continuity agreement.
