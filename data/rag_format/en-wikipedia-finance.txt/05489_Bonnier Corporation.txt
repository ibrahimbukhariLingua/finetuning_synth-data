Bonnier Corporation


# Bonnier Corporation



**Bonnier LLC** (formerly **Bonnier Corporation**) is an American "outdoor adventure" company that originally operated numerous U.S.-based media brands but struggled in the magazine publishing industry, leading to the decline or closure of several well-known titles. Formed in 2007 after Bonnier Group's acquisition of publishing assets from Time, today it operates events within the vertical of outdoor recreation.


## History

The company was formed in March 2007 as the U.S. subsidiary of Bonnier Group, after it acquired the 18 magazines of the Time Warner divisions Time4 Media (owner of publications such as *Transworld Skateboarding*) and The Parenting Group (owner of publications such as *Parenting*) for $200 million, and combined them with its 50% stake in World Publications. In June 2009 Hachette Filipacchi sold *American Photo, Boating,* *Flying,* *Sound & Vision,* and *Popular Photography* to Bonnier.

In April 2013, Bonnier sold its skiing publications, including *Skiing* and Warren Miller Entertainment, to Active Interest Media. In May 2013, Bonnier sold *Sound & Vision* and the TransWorld Group titles to Source Interlink, and in turn acquired Source Interlink's motorcycle magazines. That month, it also sold The Parenting Group to Meredith Corporation; its publications were immediately shut down, and subscribers were transferred to other Meredith-owned publications.

In June 2015, Bonnier Corp. was defrauded of $1.5 million through a phishing e-mail scam emanating from China that targeted its accounting department. The perpetrators hacked into the email of Bonnier Corp. CEO Dave Freygang and sent instructions to the accounting department to transfer the funds to a Chinese bank account. Bonnier Corp. said money was electronically sent in two $1.5 million wire transfers four days apart. The second transfer was able to be recalled before it was received, but the first transfer could not be recovered.

In October 2020, Bonnier sold a number of its major magazines, including *Popular Science*, *Popular Photography*, *Outdoor Life*, and *Field & Stream*, to North Equity LLC. In 2022, the company began to reposition and restructure its operations, and began to brand itself as an "outdoor adventure company" to emphasize its events, focusing specifically upon core verticals of marine recreation (including boating, sailing, and fishing), hunting, and travel. The company then sold remaining of its non-*Marlin* branded magazines to Firecrown in 2023.
