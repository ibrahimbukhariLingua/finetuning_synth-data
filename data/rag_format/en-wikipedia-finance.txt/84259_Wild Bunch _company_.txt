# Wild Bunch (company)



**Wild Bunch AG** is a German film distribution company, originally created in 1979 as Senator Film Verleih GmbH, which later became Senator Entertainment AG. The name Wild Bunch comes from the French company Wild Bunch S.A., created in 2002, which became a subsidiary of Senator Entertainment in February 2015. Senator Entertainment AG renamed itself Wild Bunch AG in July 2015. Wild Bunch has distributed and sold films such as *Land of the Dead* (2005), *Southland Tales* (2006), *Cassandra's Dream* (2007), *Vicky Cristina Barcelona* (2008), *Che* (2008), *Whatever Works* (2009), *The King's Speech* (2010), *The Artist* (2011), *Titane* and *Where Is Anne Frank* (2021).

Wild Bunch was also formerly an international sales holding company, but they soon divested the division as an independent company in July 2019 as **Wild Bunch International**, which rebranded as **Goodfellas** in March 2023 following the expiration of the company's three-year pact to use the Wild Bunch name.


## History

Originally a division of StudioCanal, Wild Bunch S.A. was established as an independent company in 2002 by former employees of StudioCanal.

In 2011, Wild Bunch took a majority stake (by means of an equity purchase made through a cash injection) of the Spanish indie distributor Vértigo Films.

In July 2014, the German film distributor Senator Entertainment and Wild Bunch announced their intention to join forces to launch an independent film distribution and production group. In February 2015, Senator Entertainment and Wild Bunch completed their merger. Senator Entertainment AG subsequently renamed themselves to Wild Bunch AG and will use Senator as a brand.

In May 2015, Wild Bunch formed a Los Angeles–based company, Insiders, to handle international sales of independent films led by Vincent Maraval. In February 2016, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that a stake in that outfit had been sold to Bliss Media, a Chinese film production and distribution company. In May 2016, Insiders and MadRiver Pictures joined forces to form an international sales joint venture, IMR international.

On 24 July 2018, Wild Bunch received approval from the Tribunal de commerce to move ahead with their restructuring plans. At the beginning of July 2019, the company reorganized all of their international sales activities into a new division, Wild Bunch International. At the beginning of June 2021, they formed the genre-oriented label Wild West with fellow French studio Capricci, and two weeks later, announced a 50/50 animation-oriented sales partnership with French animation distributor Gebeka Films at the 62nd Annecy International Animation Film Festival.
