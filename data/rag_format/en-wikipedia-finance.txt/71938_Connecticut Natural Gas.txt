The relocation of CNG's headquarters from Adrien's Landing to East Hartford cost $37 million which was paid for by the state. The move was controversial because the contractor chosen to do the job (Tomasso Group) had a corrupt relationship with then Governor John G. Rowland, who was overseeing the development of Adrien's Landing, that eventually cost him his job. Tomasso Group principal Angelo Tomasso Jr. also served on the CNG board at the time.
