Calcutt v. FDIC


# Calcutt v. FDIC



***Calcutt v. FDIC***, 598 U.S. \_\_\_ (2023), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court held that an administrative agency's discretionary order may be upheld in court only on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.


## Description

Harry C. Calcutt III was the CEO of Northwestern Bank during the Great Recession, when their relationship with one of their customers was allegedly mismanaged. The FDIC opened an investigation, and ordered him removed from his position, banned from further management positions with banks, and to pay a $125,000 fine. Calcutt appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the FDIC had made two errors in their investigation of Calcutt. Instead of remanding the case to be re-investigated, the Sixth Circuit conducted their own review of the record and concluded that enough evidence existed to support the FDIC's conclusion. Calcutt appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court, which held that the Sixth Circuit erred in conducting their own review of the facts of Calcutt's case. The court revered the decision of the Sixth Circuit and remanded the case to the FDIC for re-investigation.
