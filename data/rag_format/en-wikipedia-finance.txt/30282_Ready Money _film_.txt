## Plot

As described in a film magazine, Stephen Baird and Mike Reardon go out west to seek their fortune in mining. They discover an abandoned mine, but find that there is an ore deposit on the premises but in the opposite direction than the mine was dug. Stephen travels home to New York to finalize the purchase of the land.

In New York, Stephen finds his first investor, Jackson Ives, who produces $50,000 in cash. When Stephen's wealthy friends see the cash, assuming he has struck gold, they all rush to invest in his mining operation.

Meanwhile out west, the owner of a neighboring mine, James Morgan, finds out that the line of ore that Mike is working on traverses both his and Stephen's property. Morgan attempts to sabotage the mine with an explosion. However, the plan backfires as the explosion reveals the gold ore.
