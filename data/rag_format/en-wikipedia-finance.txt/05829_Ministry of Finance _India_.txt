## Department of Investment and Public Asset Management

The Department of Disinvestment has been renamed as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management or 'DIPAM', a decision aimed at the proper management of Centre's investments in equity including its disinvestment in central public sector undertakings. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced the renaming of the Department of Disinvestment in his budget speech for 2016–17. Initially set up as an independent ministry (The Ministry of Disinvestment) in December 1999, the Department of Disinvestments came into existence in May 2004 when the ministry was turned into a department of the Ministry of Finance. The department took up all the functions of the erstwhile ministry which broadly was responsible for a systematic policy approach to disinvestment and privatisation of Public Sector Units (PSUs).

Arunish Chawla (IAS) is the current secretary of this department.


## Department of Public Enterprises

The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) which was earlier part of the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises was shifted to Ministry of Finance. Resulting in Finance Ministry having six departments while the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises was renamed to the Ministry of Heavy Industries. This shift was carried out to help in efficient monitoring of the capital expenditure, asset monetisation and financial health of the Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs).
