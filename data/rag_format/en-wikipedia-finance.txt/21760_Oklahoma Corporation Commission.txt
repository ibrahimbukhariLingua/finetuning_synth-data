Oklahoma Corporation Commission


# Oklahoma Corporation Commission



The **Oklahoma Corporation Commission** is the public utilities commission of the U.S state of Oklahoma run by three statewide elected commissioners. Authorized to employ more than 500 employees, it regulates oil and gas drilling, utilities and telephone companies.


## History

The commission was established in 1907 and the First Oklahoma Legislature gave the commission authority to regulate public service corporations.

Railroad, telephone and telegraph companies were the companies first regulated by the commission, which also collected records of the stockholders, officers and directors of corporations chartered or licensed to do business in Oklahoma. Record collection duties were later split; the commission keeping records only for public service companies. The commission added pipelines, water, heat, light and power in early years.

The commission began regulating oil and gas in 1914 and was given additional regulatory power over the industry the following year.


## Terms and qualifications

Candidates for the commission must be a citizen of Oklahoma for over two years before their election, at least 30 years of age and have no interest in any entity regulated by the commission.

Commissioners serve a six-year term. The terms are staggered so that one commissioner is up for re-election every two years, in even-numbered years. The chair of the commission is determined by the three commissioners.

In case of vacancy the Governor of Oklahoma appoints a replacement, to stand until the next general election. The commissioner elected at that election will serve the remaining unexpired term, so as to maintain the staggered term system.


## Duties

The Commission regulates and enforces the laws and supervised the actives associated with:

* The exploration and production of oil and gas
* The storage and dispensing of petroleum based fuels
* The establishment of rates and services of public utilities
* The operation of intrastate transportation
* The administration of the Oklahoma Universal Service Fund for internet to schools, libraries, and qualified health centers.

Early emphasis for the commission was on regulation of railroad routes and rates. Through changes by the Legislature, and the change in services considered essential to the public welfare, the commission presently regulates public utilities, oil and gas industry (exploration, drilling, production and waste disposal), motor carrier transport, and petroleum products industry (transportation, storage, quality and dispensing). The commission also monitors a number of federal programs for compliance in Oklahoma. The commission also oversees the conservation of natural resources, avoiding waste production, abate pollution of the environment, and balancing the rights and needs of the people of Oklahoma with those of the regulated entities. The Public Utility Division acts as the Administrator for the states $30 million Universal Services Fund. This fund supports rural telecommunications as well as internet to Oklahoma public schools, libraries, and health centers.


## Membership

Former Oklahoma Secretary of State, Senator, and House Member Brian Bingman won the 2024 Corporation Commissioner statewide vote. His term will commence on January 13, 2025, replacing longtime and longest running incumbent Corporation Commissioner in US history, Bob Anthony. Commissioner Anthony could not rerun for office due to the 12-year term limit enacted in 2010 after voters approved Oklahoma State Question 747.
