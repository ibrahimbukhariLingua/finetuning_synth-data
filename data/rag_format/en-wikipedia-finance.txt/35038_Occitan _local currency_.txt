The Occitan program is intended to promote local commerce. The Occitan operates with a fixed exchange rate: 1 Occitan = €1.
There is a fixed commission of 4% for members (shops) and 6% for individuals.

## Currency issue, exchange and acceptance

They have a 1-year validity.

Bills of 1, 2, 5, and 10 Occitans are issued. They feature an Occitan cross and the portrait of Molière who started his career in Pézenas.

To maintain an individual bill's validity, a "scrip" corresponding to 2% of the banknote value must be paid every six months. (This system, called demurrage, is a form of currency circulation tax and was invented by Silvio Gesell.)
