## The Glass Elevator initiative

The initiative is designed to provide mentoring for mid to senior ranking female executives in major corporations, as well as engagement with some of Australia's most successful business leaders.

The Glass Elevator names reflects the need for active organisational support from large organisations to ensure that problems associated with or evidenced by glass ceilings can be better addressed over time.
