## History of textile business

Standard Coosa-Thatcher Company made a significant addition to its Chattanooga, Tennessee mill in 1925. It operated thirteen plants in California, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia. In 1981 the enterprise generated $175.5 million in sales and net income of $1.5 million or $2.82 per share.

Owners of the concern agreed to be acquired by a group of company executives, with additional funding from Wolsey & Company, a New York City investment firm, in April 1982.
