## History

Reitnau is first mentioned in 1045 as *Reitinouwa*. The village was originally owned by the Count of Lenzburg, though in 1045 it and the village church were granted to the convent in Schänis. The property was administered by a representative of the convent. Following the conquest of the Aargau in 1415, the village belonged to Bern and was part of the bailiwick of Lenzburg. However, the low court for Reitnau continued to be held in Schänis. It remained part of Bern until 1798 and in 1803 became a municipality in the new canton of Aargau. In 1873 the municipality opened its first schoolhouse, and in 1905, it received a district school.

The church's administration was transferred in 1807 from the convent in Schänis into private hands, and was taken over in 1850 by the District. A church existed in the village before 900, though the present building dates from about 1522.

Until the 19th Century the village was dominated by agriculture. In the 18th Century home cloth weaving brought another source of income. Between 1900-33 there was a Bally Shoe factory. Around 1990 it became part of the agglomerations of Zofingen and Aarau. In 2005, the manufacturing sector provided 35% of the jobs, while the services sector provided 41%.
