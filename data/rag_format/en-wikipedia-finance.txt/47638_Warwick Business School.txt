## History

Warwick's School of Industrial and Business Studies (SIBS) was founded in 1967, with five academic staff including Hugh Clegg as the first Professor of Industrial Relations, and 24 postgraduate students on three courses. The first master's courses were launched in 1968, and undergraduate courses started in 1969. In 1973, WBS joined the Conference of University Management Schools (now the Chartered Association of Business Schools), which had been established in 1971.

In 1981, the MSc in Management was renamed the MBA. In 1985 WBS launched an evening MBA and this was followed in 1986 by an MBA by distance learning. By 1987, the department had grown to over 100 staff, 815 students and 11 programs. In 1988, SIBS was renamed Warwick Business School. In 1997, the staff tally was over 260, with 3,160 students across 17 programs. In 2007, there were a total of 304 staff and over 7,500 students on 26 courses.

In 2000, WBS became the first UK business school to hold triple accreditation from the Association of MBAs (AMBA; from 1970 according to WBS although, according to AMBA, the accreditation service was not launched until 1983), the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS; from 1999) and from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB; from 2000).

In September 2014, WBS opened a second site on the 17th floor of the Shard in Southwark, London, to teach part-time MSc Finance, MSc Human Resource Management and Executive MBA courses.
