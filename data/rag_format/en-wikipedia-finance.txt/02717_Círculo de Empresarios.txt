Círculo de Empresarios


# Círculo de Empresarios



**Círculo de Empresarios** (founded in Madrid on 31 March 1977) is a Spanish non-profit organisation dedicated to the study, dissemination and promotion of free enterprise and the role of the entrepreneur in the creation of wealth. It also aims to contribute to the economic and social debate in Spain and to promote entrepreneurship.


## History

The historical background of its creation goes back to the Asociación para el Estudio y Acción Empresarial, promoted in November 1976 by the minister José María López de Letona. He brought together a group of 50 personalities and encouraged them to create an association that would defend, among other freedoms, the freedom of business. The CEOE (Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations), promoted by Carlos Ferrer y Salat, brought together the other associations promoted by businessmen to defend their interests.

Founded as an association in 1977, at the beginning of the Spanish transition and shortly after the signing of the Pactos de la Moncloa, the Circulo brought together a hundred leading businessmen from large and medium-sized Spanish companies to contribute to the economic debate from a business perspective.

Círculo de Empresarios celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2002. The occasion was used to consider the role of entrepreneurship and Círculo de Empresarios itself throughout the years. Carlos Rodríguez Braun, Professor of the History of Economic Thought, used a chronological-thematic methodology to analyse the proposals made at the time on the labour market, the reform of the welfare state, the situation of the Autonomous Communities and budgetary balance, some of which were subsequently adopted by both conservative and socialist governments.

Like the corporate organisation CEOE, the Círculo has been a defender of business people's vision in the various political and economic phases from the transition to the economic crisis of 2008.

In 2024, Juan María Nin Génova was elected president, replacing Manuel Pérez-Sala Gozalo.


## Development

They followed the model of the US Business Roundtable, advised by McKinsey. Politically and economically independent, the Circulo has served as a think-tank and promoter of liberal ideas. This is done through a fourfold approach: publications, meetings, action programmes that involve different sectors of Spanish society, and regular awards.

It has contributed to the valuable political and economic debate by publishing numerous economic studies and providing a timely diagnosis of the current socio-economic situation.

Since 2014, they have awarded the *Premio Reino de España a la Trayectoria Empresarial* (Kingdom of Spain Award for Business Trajectory) with the support of the Royal Household and the collaboration of Círculo de Economía and Círculo de Empresarios Vascos. In 2014, the award went to Enrique de Sendagorta (Grupo Sener) and in 2015 to José Ferrer Sala (Freixenet).
