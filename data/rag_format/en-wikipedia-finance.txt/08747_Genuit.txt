## History

The company was established as Polypipe by Kevin McDonald (a former plumber) and Geoff Harrison in 1980. In October 1995 the company bought Sud Ouest Plastiques (of France) for £2.1m, in January 1997 it bought TDI for £3.1m and in November 1997 it bought Gabo Systemtechnik for £6m. Then in July 1998 the company bought Domus Ducting (renamed Polypipe Ventilation) for £4.7m and in January 1999 it bought Pagette Sanitar Produktions (of Germany) for £9m.

In March 1999 the company was bought by IMI for £337m; Kevin MacDonald made £56m from this deal and Geoffrey Harrison made £12.5m. IMI sold Polypipe to Castle Harlan (of the United States), a private equity company, for £293m in September 2005. In May 2007 it bought Terrain, a PVC piping business in Aylesford in Kent. Then in August 2007, a management buyout took control of the company from the private equity company, in a deal funded by Bank of Scotland Integrated Finance. In February 2010 the company bought Silavent, a ventilation manufacturer.

In April 2014, Polypipe was the subject of an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Then in November 2014, Polypipe acquired the Ferrob Ventilation business. In February 2015, Polypipe acquired Surestop, a business producing an alternative product to the brass stopcock, and in August 2015 Polypipe acquired Nuaire, a ventilation systems manufacturer.

It was announced in May 2017 that Martin Payne will succeed David Hall as the CEO following his retirement.

The company changed its name from Polypipe to Genuit Group in March 2021.
