# Düsseldorf (region)



**Düsseldorf** is one of the five *Regierungsbezirke* of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, located in the north-west of the country. It covers the western part of the Ruhr Area, as well as the *Niederrheinische Tiefebene*, the lower Rhine area. It is the most populated of all German administrative areas of the kind. It is the only area in Germany where the traditional dialects are Low Franconian, rather than Low German or High German.

It was created as a subdivision of the Prussian Rhineland when Prussia reformed its internal administration in 1815. In 1822 the *Regierungsbezirk Kleve* was incorporated into Regierungbezirk Düsseldorf.

Its highest point is the Brodtberg (378 m).
