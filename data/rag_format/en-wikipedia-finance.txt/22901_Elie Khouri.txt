## Early life and education

Khouri was born in Beirut in 1964. His early life was affected by the Lebanese Civil War, as his family was unable to relocate from the city. He attended the American University of Beirut, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1986 and an MBA in business and finance in 1988.

In 2006, Omnicom Media Group expanded its presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) by launching PHD globally and opening a new office in Dubai. This expansion led to the creation of the Omnicom Media Group MENA, where Khouri transitioned from his regional managing director role at OMD to become the group's CEO. He held this position until 2019, when he was appointed chairman.

In 2017, Khouri founded Vivium, a single-family office that invests in real estate, design, ventures, and collectibles including art. Khouri was involved in launching Sotheby’s International Realty in Dubai and supported its expansion into KSA, the UK, and Spain.
