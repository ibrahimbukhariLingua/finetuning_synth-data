The first recorded use of the term in English is in the *Canton Register* of 28 October 1834. Historical variant spellings include *taepan* (first appearance) and *typan*.

The term also refers to the Chinese-Filipino business oligarchs who own or have involvement in various businesses in the Philippines and are the powerful billionaire-founders of Chinese-Filipino business empires. Examples of taipans are: The López family of Iloilo of Lopez Holdings Corporation; the late Henry Sy of SM Investments; National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) vice-chairmen Henry T. Sy Jr. and Robert Coyiuto Jr.; Ramon Ang of San Miguel Corporation; and Lucio Tan of Philippine Airlines.


## In popular culture

The term gained wide currency outside China after the publication of Somerset Maugham's 1922 short story "The Taipan" and James Clavell's 1966 novel *Tai-Pan*, and was film adapted in 1986, directed by Daryl Duke.

The term was used to describe the protagonist's family in *Empire of the Sun*.
