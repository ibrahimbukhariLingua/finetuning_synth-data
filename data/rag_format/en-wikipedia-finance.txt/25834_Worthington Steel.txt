On June 3, 1955, Worthington Steel was founded by John H. McConnell.

The Worthington Steel Company started with a single slitter line and a few employees, grossing $342,000 in its first year. During the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the company added steel processing capabilities to its operations and reached sales of $12.5 million in 1967.

The Worthington Steel Company became a publicly traded company in 1968 through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (now known as Nasdaq). Shareholders purchased 150,000 shares at $7.50 each.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, The Worthington Steel Company acquired new companies. In 1971, with the acquisition of a pressure cylinder business, The Worthington Steel Company name changed to Worthington Industries.

Operating under the name Worthington Industries, the company expanded its operations throughout the 1980s.

In 1992, Worthington Industries launched a joint venture called the TWB Company, expanding into the tailor welded blank market in North America.

In 2000, Worthington Industries moved from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: WOR). Throughout the 2010s, Worthington acquired new businesses and facilities, including Rome Strip Steel Company, Inc., and Heidtman Steel Product Inc.'s pickling and slitting operation in Cleveland, Ohio.
