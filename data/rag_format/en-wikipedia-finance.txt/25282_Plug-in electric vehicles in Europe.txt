Plug-in electric vehicles in Europe


# Plug-in electric vehicles in Europe



The adoption of **plug-in electric vehicles in Europe** is actively supported by the European Union and several national, provincial, and local governments in Europe. A variety of policies have been established to provide direct financial support to consumers and manufacturers; non-monetary incentives; subsidies for the deployment of charging infrastructure; and long term regulations with specific targets. In particular, the EU regulation that set the mandatory targets for average fleet CO₂ emissions for new cars has been effective in contributing to the successful uptake of plug-in cars in recent years

Europe had about 5.6 million plug-in electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles on the road at the end of 2021. The European stock of plug-in cars is the world's second largest after China, accounting for about 32% of the global stock in 2021.

Europe also has the world's second largest light commercial electric vehicle stock, 33% of the global fleet in 2020, As of December 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, France listed as the European country with the largest stock of light-duty all-electric utility vans, with about 62,000 units, followed by Germany (29,500), and the UK (almost 15,000).

The plug-in passenger car segment had a market share of 1.3% of new car registrations in 2016, rose to 3.6% in 2019, and achieved 11.4% in 2020. Despite the segment's rapid growth, as of December 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, only 1% of all passenger cars on European roads were plug-in electric.

As of December 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Germany led cumulative sales in Europe with 1.38 million plug-in cars registered since 2010, followed by France (786,274), the UK (~745,000), Norway (647,000), and the Netherlands (390,454). Norway has the highest market penetration per capita in the world, also has achieved the world's largest plug-in segment market share of new car sales, 86.2% in 2020, and 22% of all passenger cars on Norwegian roads were plug-ins by the end of 2021. Germany was the top selling European country market in terms of annual volume from 2019 to 2023, but was overtaken by the UK in 2024.

In 2020, and despite the strong decline in global car sales brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, annual sales of plug-in passenger cars in Europe surpassed the 1 million mark for the first time. Also, Europe outsold China in 2020 as the world's largest plug-in passenger car market for the first time since 2015.


## Government incentives and policies

The European Union and several national, provincial, and local governments around Europe have introduced policies to support the mass market adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. A variety of policies have been established to provide direct financial support to consumers and manufacturers; non-monetary incentives; subsidies for the deployment of charging infrastructure; procurement of electric vehicle for government fleets; and long term regulations with specific targets.


### Financial incentives

Financial incentives for consumers aim to make plug-in electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars due to the still higher up front cost of electric vehicles. Among the financial incentives there are one-time purchase incentives such as tax credits, purchase grants, exemptions from import duties, and other fiscal incentives; exemptions from road, bridge and tunnel tolls, and from congestion pricing fees; and exemption of registration and annual use vehicle fees. There are also several non-monetary incentives such as allowing plug-in vehicles access to bus lanes, free parking and free charging.

As of May 2019ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, tax benefits and incentives for electrically chargeable passenger cars were available in 24 out of the then 28 European Union member states. Nevertheless, only 12 member states offered bonus or grant payments as purchase incentives, and most countries only grant tax reductions or exemptions for all-electric cars. Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland offered no incentives.

France introduced in 2008 a bonus–malus CO₂ based tax system that penalize fossil-fuel vehicle sales. This a revenue-neutral policy mechanism allows to balance government support with direct revenues from the taxes collected from sale of particularly polluting and/or greenhouse gas emitting cars. The bonus applies to private and company vehicles purchased on or after 5 December 2007, and is deducted from the purchase price of the vehicle. The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration.


### EU average fleet CO₂ emissions

European Union Directive No 443/2009 set a mandatory average fleet CO₂ emissions target for new cars, after a voluntary commitment made in 1998 by the auto industry had failed to reduce emissions by 2007. The regulation applies to new passenger cars registered in the European Union and EEA member states for the first time. A carmaker who fails to comply has to pay an "excess emissions premium" for each vehicle registered according with the amount of g/km of exceeded.

The 2009 regulation set a 2015 target of 130 g/km for the fleet average for new passenger cars. A similar set of regulations for light commercial vehicles was set in 2011, with an emissions target of 175 g/km for 2017. Both targets were met several years in advance. A second set of regulations, passed in 2014, established a new target of average CO₂ emissions of new cars to fall to 95 g/km, scheduled to be phased-in in 2020 (95%), and fully apply from 2021 onward. The target for light-commercial vehicles was set to 147 g/km by 2020.

In April 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 was adopted, which introduced CO₂ emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for 2025 and 2030. The new Regulation went into force on 1 January 2020, and has replaced and repealed Regulation (EC) 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011. The 2019 Regulation set new emission targets relative to a 2021 baseline, with a reduction of the average CO₂ emissions from new cars by 15% in 2025 (81 g/km), and by 37.5% in 2030 (59 g/km). For light-commercial vehicles the new targets are a 15% reduction for 2025 and a 31% reduction for 2030.

The 2019 Regulation also introduced an incentive mechanism or credit system from 2025 onwards for zero- and low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs). A ZLEV is defined as a passenger car or a commercial van with CO₂ emissions between 0 and 50 g/km. The regulation set ZLEV sales targets of 15% for 2025 and 35% for 2030, and manufacturers have some flexibility in how they achieve those targets. Carmakers that outperform the ZLEV sales targets will be rewarded with higher CO₂ emission targets, but the target relaxation is capped at a maximum 5% to safeguard the integrity of the regulation.

Since 2018, European carmakers have been fully embracing electrification of their car models to further reduce CO₂ emissions, and comply with the targets established by the EU. The EU regulations have resulted in a significant growth of sales of plug-in electric cars since 2019.

In 2020, despite a strong decline of overall car sales in all countries as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the plug-in car segment has increased significantly its market share. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), during the first quarter of 2020, and due to the COVID‐19 outbreak, the market share of new passenger plug-in electric cars in the 27 EU countries was 6.8%, up from 2.5% in the same period in 2018. In April 2020 the European plug-in market share rose to 11%.

In order to reduce Norway's greenhouse gas emissions, its government pledged in 2012, among other measures, a target for the average fleet CO₂ emission rate of new passenger cars of 85 g/km by 2020, 10 g/km lower than the European Commission's targets for 2021.

As a result of its fast growing EV market penetration, average fleet CO₂ emissions have been falling in Norway every year. Norway achieved in 2016 the European target set for 2021, with average CO₂ emissions for all new passenger cars registered in 2016 of 93 g/km, down 7 g/km from 2015. Average CO₂ emissions for all new passenger cars registered in 2017 was 82 g/km, down from 93 g/km in 2016, and below the government's target of 85 grams set for 2020. Norway achieved its transportation emissions target three years before the pledged deadline.

Annual average new passenger car fleet CO₂ emissions reached an all-time low in 2019 with 60 g/km, 11 g/km lower than in 2018. Nevertheless, the average for gasoline-powered cars declined only 1 g/km from 2018 to 93 g/km, while diesel-powered cars increase their average CO₂ emissions from 131 g/km in 2018 to 134 g/km in 2019. The net gain in the overall reduction of average fleet CO₂ emissions is the result of the large market share of 42.4% achieved by the all-electric segment in 2019.


### Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles

Timeline of national targets
for full ICE phase out or
100% ZEV car sales
| Selected countries | Year |
| --- | --- |
| Norway (100% ZEV sales) | 2025 |
| Denmark | 2030 |
| Iceland |
| Ireland |
| Netherlands (100% ZEV sales) |
| Sweden |
| United Kingdom |
| France | 2040 |
| Germany (100% ZEV sales) | 2050 |

Several European governments have made long term pledges with compliance targets within a specific timeframe such as ZEV mandates and the phase out of internal combustion engine vehicle sales. For example, Norway set a national goal that all new car sales by 2025 should be zero emission vehicles (electric or hydrogen).

Some cities are planning to establish a partial or total ban on internal combustion engine vehicles or to implement zero-emission zones (ZEZ) restricting traffic access into an urban cordon area or city center where only zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are allowed access. In such areas, all internal combustion engine vehicles are banned.

As of May 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, cities planning to gradually introduce ZEZ, or a partial or total ban fossil fuel powered vehicles include, among others, Amsterdam (2030), Athens (2025), Barcelona (2030), Brussels (2030/2035), Copenhagen (2030), London (2020/2025), Madrid (2025), Milan (2030), Oslo (2024/2030), Oxford (2021–2035), Paris (2024/2030), and Rome (2024/2030).


### Other policies

There are also measures to promote efficient vehicles in the Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles, and in the Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.

The 2009 Directive applies to contracting entities under the obligation to apply the procurement procedures set out in Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC, as well as operators of public passenger transport services by rail and by road under a public service contract within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007. These entities and operators should take into account lifetime energy and environmental impacts, including energy consumption and emissions of CO₂, and of certain pollutants, when purchasing road transport vehicles with the objectives of promoting and stimulating the market for clean and energy efficient vehicles.


## Markets and sales

Europe had about 5.6 million plug-in electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in circulation at the end of 2021, consisting of 2.9 million fully electric passenger cars, 2.5 million plug-in hybrid cars, and about 220,000 light commercial all-electric vehicles. As of December 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the European stock of plug-in passenger is the world's second largest market after China, accounting for 32% of the global car stock in 2020 Europe outsold China in 2020 as the world's largest plug-in passenger car market for the first time since 2015.

Europe also has the second largest electric light commercial vehicle stock, 33% of the global stock in 2020. As of December 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, France listed as the European country with the largest stock of light-duty electric commercial vehicles, with about 62,000 utility vans in use, and also ranks as the world's second after China.

Since 2016 the plug-in passenger car segment has experienced rapid growth, with annual registrations increasing 33% in 2018, 45% in 2019, and 137% in 2020. The plug-in segment had a market share of 1.3% of new car registrations in 2016, rose to 3.6% in 2019, and achieved 11.4% in 2020. Despite the segment's rapid growth, as of December 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, only 1.0% of passenger cars on European roads were plug-in electric vehicles, and just 0.3% of light commercial vehicles on the EU roads were fully electric in 2019.

Cumulative sales of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles in Europe passed the 500,000 unit mark in May 2016, the one million milestone in June 2018, and the two million mark in April 2020. Norway passed the 100,000th registered plug-in unit milestone in April 2016, France passed the same milestone in September 2016, and the Netherlands in November 2016. The UK achieved the 100,000 unit mark in March 2017.

Norway was the top selling plug-in country market in terms of annual sales from 2016 to 2018. In 2019, Germany surpassed Norway as the best selling plug-in market, leading both sales of the all-electric and the plug-in hybrid segments, and again in 2020, Germany listed as the top selling European country market, with a record of over 394,000 units sold. The only country that outsold Germany in 2020 was China, and France and the UK ranked among the top five best selling countries.

As of December 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Germany is the European country with the largest stock of plug-ins in the continent, with 1.38 million plug-in passenger cars registered since 2010. Ranking next is France with 786,274 light-duty plug-in electric vehicles, followed by the UK with about 745,000 plug-in cars, and Norway with 647,000 light-duty plug-in electric vehicles. Norway continues to have the highest market penetration per capita in Europe and the world, and in 2021 achieved the world's largest annual plug-in segment market share of new car sales ever, 86.2%. Also, Norway has the highest share of plug-in cars in use in the world, with 22.1% of all passenger cars on the road by the end 2021.

During 2013 took place a surge in sales of plug-in hybrids in the European market, particularly in the Netherlands, with 20,164 PHEVs registered during the year. Out of the 71,943 highway-capable plug-in electric passenger cars and utility vans sold in the region during 2013, plug-in hybrids totaled 31,447 units, representing 44% of the plug-in electric vehicle segment sales that year. This trend continued in 2014. Plug-in hybrids represented almost 30% of the plug-in electric drive sales during the first six months of 2014, and with the exception of the Nissan Leaf, sales of the previous European best selling models fell significantly, while recently introduced models captured a significant share of the segment sales, with the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, Tesla Model S, BMW i3, Renault Zoe, Volkswagen e-Up!, and the Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid (available as a diesel–electric hybrid) ranking among the top ten best selling models.

In 2014 Norway was the top selling country in the light-duty all-electric market segment, with 18,649 passenger cars and utility vans registered, more than doubling its 2013 sales. France ranked second with 15,046 units registered, followed by Germany with 8,804 units, the UK with 7,730 units, and the Netherlands with 3,585 car and vans registrations. In the plug-in hybrid segment, the Netherlands was the top selling country in 2014 with 12,425 passenger cars registered, followed by the UK with 7,821, Germany with 4,527, and Sweden 3,432 units.

As of December 2015ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, almost 25% of the European plug-in stock was registered in the Nordic countries, with over 100,000 units registered. In 2015, combined registrations in the four countries were up 91% from 2014.

For the first time in the region, in 2015 plug-in hybrids (95,140) outsold all-electric cars (89,640) in the passenger car segment, however, when light-duty plug-in utility vehicles are accounted for, the all-electric segment totaled 97,687 registrations in 2015, up 65,199 in 2014, and ahead of the plug-in hybrid segment. Also in 2015, the European market share of plug-in electric cars passed the 1% mark for the first time, with a 1.41% share of new car sales that year. This trend continue during 2016. Since April 2016 plug-in hybrids have outsold all-electric cars, and the gap has continued to widen. Accounting for passenger plug-in car sales in Western Europe between January and July 2016, plug-in hybrids captured almost 54% of the region's plug-in market sales. During 2016 the all-electric car segment ended with a market share of 0.57% of new car sales, while plug-in hybrids reached a market share of 0.73%.


### 2016–2017

European sales of plug-in electric cars passed 200,000 units for the first time in 2016. The plug-in segment achieved a market share of 1.3% of total new car sales in 2016. Norway was the top selling plug-in car country in Europe in 2016 with 45,492 plug-in cars and vans registered, followed by the UK with about 36,907 units, France with 33,774, Germany with 25,154, the Netherlands with 24,645, and Sweden with 13,454. France was the top selling market in the light-duty all-electric segment with 27,307 units registered, up 23% from 2015. The plug-in car segment of ten European countries achieved a market share of new car sales above 1%, led by Norway with 29.1%, followed by the Netherlands with 6.4%, Sweden with 3.5%, and Switzerland with 1.8%.

The Renault Zoe was the best-selling all-electric car in Europe in 2016 with 21,735 units delivered, and also topped European sales in the broader plug-in electric car segment, ahead of the Outlander P-HEV, the top selling plug-in in the previous two years. The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV with 21,446 units sold was the second best-selling plug-in car, followed by the Nissan Leaf with 18,718. The Outlander PHEV has been Europe's best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle for four years in a row, from 2013 to 2016. The top selling all-electric commercial van was the Nissan e-NV200 with 4,319 units registered.

Registrations totaled 302,383 units in 2017, of which, 149,086 (49.3%) were all-electric cars and vans, and 153,297 (50.7%) were plug-in hybrid cars. The segment market share achieved a record 1.74% in 2017.
