## Early history of RCM foreign circulation

In 1970, Master of the Mint Gordon Ward Hunter relaunched the Foreign Circulation division. In January 1970, the RCM won a contract from Singapore to produce six million rimmed blanks in a cupronickel alloy.¹⁴⁸ This was the Mint's first export contract since a contract for the Dominican Republic 32 years earlier. The second contract came in April 1970 from the Central Bank of Brazil. The RCM produced 84 million blanks for the 50-centavo piece.¹⁴⁸ In August 1971, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen placed an order for 2 million five-fil pieces. This was followed by an order from Iceland for 2.5 million one-crown pieces.

In October 1971, the Bank of Jamaica asked the RCM to produce a commemorative ten-dollar coin in sterling silver, and a twenty-dollar gold coin of proof quality. Also in 1971, the RCM made coins for the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and the Isle of Man.¹⁴ An order for 100 million general circulation five-centime and ten-centimo coins for Venezuela was received as well. By 1973, orders totalled sixty-five million coins and seventy million blanks. By 1974, the Ottawa facility produced a total of 1.2 billion coins (foreign and domestic), a facility record.¹⁴⁹
