## History

Intralot originated as a spin-off of the Intracom group, owned by the Greek billionaire Sokratis Kokkalis. It originally provided infrastructure for the Greek National Lottery (OPAP), under a 1999 contract, but has since expanded its operations into a worldwide market. Intralot's games library includes a variety of games such as numerical games, TV lottery games, sports lotteries, fixed odds betting, instant lotteries, pari-mutuel, video lottery and monitor games.

In December 2009, Intralot announced purchasing 35% of the American online games provider CyberArts, purposing to expand its subsidiary company, Intralot Interactive (I2). In October 2011, Intralot concluded the sale of its minority stake in CyberArts, as per the Group's decision not to exercise the option to increase its participation to 51% and focus on its own technology and services. During ICE Totally Gaming 2015 the company announced that it will acquire a stake of 25% of Bit8.

In December 2017, Intralot completed its acquisition of Bit8, enabling its digital transformation strategy for lottery modernisation.


## Activities

In May 2008, Intralot was implicated in the criminal investigation of Romanian Politician Christian Boureanu for "abuse of office against the public interest" by the National Anticorruption Directorate for Boureanu's role in signing a contract in 2000 between *Loteria Română* and Intracom SA Hellenic Telecommunication Electronics Industry (Intralot Integrated Lottery Systems and Services) that caused *Loteria Română* to incur losses of over €120 million.

In February 2019, the D.C. Council authorized a sole-source contract for sports betting throughout Washington, D.C. Intralot, who runs the lottery within the district, will manage and provide services for the online sports betting component within D.C.

This deal was temporarily blocked in September 2019 when an injunction was issued against the sole-source sports betting lottery contract with Intralot. One month later, the injunction was tossed aside by the judge and the contract was allowed to move forward.
