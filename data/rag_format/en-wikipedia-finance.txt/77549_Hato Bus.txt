In March 1949, the sightseeing bus business was transferred to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government with an initial staff of five female guides. The company started regular Tokyo half-day sightseeing bus services. In April 1951, the company launched regular night time sightseeing services. In September 1951, it began full-day courses in Tokyo, and in June 1953 English-language tour serves for non-Japanese visitors.

In September 1963, the company changed to its current name Hato Bus Co., Ltd. From 1964 with the arrival of the Tokyo Summer Olympics the company further expanded services and offerings to meet visitor demand.
