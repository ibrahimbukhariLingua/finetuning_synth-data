United States House Small Business Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations


# United States House Small Business Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations



The **House Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and Regulations** is one of five subcommittees of the House Small Business Committee. The subcommittee was formed for the 107th Congress, when the Subcommittee on Government Programs and Oversight and the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform and Paperwork Reduction were merged to create the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform and Oversight. The first chair of that subcommittee was Mike Pence. During the 110th and 111th Congresses, it was renamed the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight. Since the 113th Congress, it has been called the Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations.
