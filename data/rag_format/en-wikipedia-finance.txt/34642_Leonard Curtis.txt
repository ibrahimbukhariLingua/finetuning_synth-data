# Leonard Curtis



**Leonard Curtis** is one of the largest independent firms in the UK specialising in corporate recovery, insolvency and business restructuring.

It is a national practice with more than 290 employees operating nationally from 28 UK and offshore locations.

Leonard Curtis is a member firm of Nexia International, a worldwide network of accounting and consulting firms.


## History

The firm was founded by Leonard Curtis, who retired in 1983.

In 1997 the firm considered and rejected a merger with Levy Gee, a general accountancy firm that went on to form Numerica. Leonard Curtis partners stated that they preferred to remain a specialist firm.

In 1998, two offices in Manchester and Liverpool with 30 staff left the firm for BDO Stoy Hayward.

Later in 1998, Leonard Curtis formed a joint venture, Fisher Curtis, with the insolvency arm of H. W. Fisher. The arrangement lasted only two years before the firms separated again.

In 2023, it became a member firm of Nexia International.


## Awards

Leonard Curtis won the mid-sized firm prize as Corporate Recovery Firm of the Year at the inaugural Insolvency and Rescue Awards 2008, run by *Credit Today* magazine.

The firm was awarded Business Recovery Specialist of the Year at the 2010 Business Moneyfacts Awards. The judging panel said: "By providing companies with positive strategic advice, Leonard Curtis has enabled many of them to retain control of their business. The Corporate Strategies team continues to focus on the critical issues, providing clear recommendations together with restructuring and refinancing services to both growing and underperforming businesses."


## Controversy

"The Liquidation Game", a 1996 edition of Channel 4's investigative documentary *Dispatches*, made allegations of sharp practice in the insolvency profession. Keith Goodman, then a partner in Leonard Curtis (later both Senior Partner of the firm and President of the IPA), claimed that a case of his was presented in a biased way, and sought an apology. However, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission rejected his complaint, saying that his case was sufficiently well set apart from other more serious allegations in the programme.
