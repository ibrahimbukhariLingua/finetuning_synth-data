Titans of Investing


# Titans of Investing



**Titans of Investing**, commonly referred to as **Titans**, is a collegiate program founded and led by investor Britt Harris.

The program consists of a semester course, a professional fraternity, and a think tank. It is modeled on Benjamin Franklin's Junto and emphasizes "wisdom, personal understanding, and growth" through "collaboration, civil discourse, and a sincere search for truth". Its mission is to infuse "high-achieving students" with "wisdom", and instill a "life path" of "success to significance" rather than pursuing "success after success", which is also modeled on Franklin's "do well by doing good." Titans is funded by over 80 individual and corporate sponsors. Graduates are referred to as "Titans", nationally recognized for "excellence, intellect, and integrity", and highly recruited by employers. As of Fall 2021, the alumni network consists of 700 Titans.


## History


### Genesis

The impetus for Titans began in the spring of 2005 while Britt Harris, a Christian, was the chief executive officer of Bridgewater Associates; the largest hedge fund in the world at that time.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He worked for nearly two decades in high-stakes wealth management. Seeking relief, a confluence of inquiries into the meaning of life, common good, and greatest literary works culminated in the idea of a collegiate course he called the "Titan Series". The initial concept was to study his "top 10 books" and his "top 10 practitioners" in each key business field (i.e., management, investing, accounting, economics, et cetera). Before resigning from Bridgewater, Harris queried 70 peers throughout business, academia, and politics for the most influential books on their careers. With a compiled list of over 200 books, Harris returned to his alma mater at Texas A&M University in the fall of 2005.


### Development

Throughout the 2005 fall semester and 2006 spring semester, Britt Harris recruited a select group of students from Texas A&M University to help organize, examine, and distill over 200 literary works to their core concept, then develop the course curriculum. The group, "Titans 0", included Cason Beckham, Will Carpenter, Jason Kaspar, Matt Ockwood, Ty Popplewell, Andrew Robertson, and Thomas Marriott who had just finished redeveloping the Aggie Investment Club. Influenced by his mentor Bob Buford, Harris infused the course with the philosophy of living a life of "success to significance" rather than pursuing "success after success". Employing the very concept of Titans (timeless wisdom), Harris modeled the course structure on Benjamin Franklin's Junto to emphasize "wisdom, personal understanding, and growth" through "collaboration, civil discourse, and a sincere search for truth".

The curriculum was finished and adopted by Mays Business School as Titans Course (FINC 427) in the summer of 2006. The first class, "Titans 1", launched in the 2006 fall semester and graduated the first 15 Titans: Jon Boben, Andy Cronin, Scott “The Situation” Deyerle, Justin Evans, Bryan Farney, Robert Fletes, Graham Gilkerson, Daniel McMaster, Payal Patel, David Phillips, Cherise (née Kaspar) Ratliff, Steven Smith, Michelle Stukey, Bryan Sweeney, and Xuan Yong.


### Growth

As Titans graduated, the collaboration and camaraderie cultivated inside the classroom continued after into the Titans Fraternity that spans 23 states and 11 countries. As of May 2019, the alumni network consists of 542 Titans from 34 classes.

In September 2016, a chapter was established at the Hankamer School of Business of Baylor University. In January 2018, a chapter was established at the McCombs Business School of University of Texas at Austin.

The book summaries produced by the Titans Course evolved into an acclaimed think tank called "Titans Briefs". Titans Briefs are freely released into the public domain. As of May 2019, the digital archive features 415 briefs.
