**Eir Sport** (stylised as **eir Sport**; formerly **Setanta Sports**) was a group of Irish television sports channels operated by **Eircom Sport Limited**, a subsidiary of Eir. In December 2015, Eir purchased original Setanta Sports operations in the Republic of Ireland, which the company rebranded as Eir Sport on 5 July 2016.


## History

In the wake of the financial difficultiesʷʰⁱᶜʰ? of Setanta GB, it was reported in June 2009 by RTÉ News that the original Setanta Sports channel, Setanta Ireland, might be bought out by an existing consortium who already hold interests in Setanta Sport Holdings Ltd., the Irish arm of Setanta Sports. Setanta Sports Ireland and Setanta Sports North America were the only brands which made a profit in 2008.

In July 2009, the ownership structure of **Setanta Sports Channel Ireland Limited** (previously **Setanta Sports Ireland Ltd**) changed. Setanta Sports Channel Ireland Limited was co-owned by Gaiety Investments (60% share) with the remaining 40% share made up by Danu Partners Limited. The main shareholders in Danu are Michael O'Rourke, Leonard Ryan, and Mark O'Meara. Danu purchased 100% of the shares in Setanta Sports North America Limited which was disposed of in early 2010. Setanta Sports Channel Ireland Limited is licensed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

The Setanta business in Ireland has managed to survive, making a strong recovery since the adversityʷʰⁱᶜʰ? in Great Britain. The company continued its resurrection by employing a further 50 employees in February 2010. Colin Morgan, formerly CEO of Quinn Direct Insurance, joined the Setanta Ireland business in October 2010.

In June 2013 it was announced that Setanta Sports would carry the new BT Sport channels as part of its overall sports package for Irish viewers. The deal added 38 live Premier League games to its television package and brought to 71 the total number of top-flight English matches on offer to Irish subscribers for the following three years.

In 2015, it was announced that Eir were in the process of buying Setanta's remaining Irish operations (Setanta Ireland and Setanta Sports 1). The deal also included the sale of the Setanta Sports Pack which includes BT Sport. On 5 July 2016, Setanta Sports was renamed Eir Sport.

In May 2021, it was announced that eir Sport would cease operations by the end of 2021.
