## History

GAINSCO's insurance operation was originally chartered as an underwriter of Commercial risks; operations that were discontinued in 2002. It marketed its commercial insurance through managing general agents, using “GAINSCO” and the block super-scribed letters “GA” as its primary logo identifiers. These letters were derived from the abbreviated version of the name of the company's primary insurance subsidiary at that time, **G**eneral **A**gents **Ins**urance **Co**mpany of America, Inc. This commercial insurance company was sold in 2007.

Beginning in 2005, a newly created GAINSCO logo mark incorporated a rising arrow in its name to inspire a progressively upward company. Registered marks include GAINSCO Auto Insurance and Are You Driven.

The A.M. Best rating of the insurance subsidiary has increased multiple times moving from a “Vulnerable” financial strength rating of “B−” to the current “Excellent” financial strength rating of “A−”.

On December 31 2020, State Farm Insurance announced its acquisition of GAINSCO as an owned subsidiary for $400 million.
