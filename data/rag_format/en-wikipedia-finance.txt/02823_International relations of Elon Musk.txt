He has also voiced his support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson. and pledged electoral support for Reform UK.


## Background


## Bolivia

In July 2020, Musk tweeted, "We will coup whoever we want" in response to a Twitter user who implied that the US government organized a coup (referring to the 2019 Bolivian political crisis) against Evo Morales for Musk to obtain lithium from Bolivia. Musk's tweet caused controversy and was later deleted.


## Canada

In January 2022, Musk tweeted "Canadian truckers rule", endorsing the Canada convoy protest, branded as the "Freedom Convoy" by its organizers. Musk tweeted extensively in support of the protest, which began as a denunciation of COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truck drivers crossing the Canada–United States border, but morphed into being against COVID-19 restrictions in general. In February, apparently supporting the protest, Musk tweeted and later deleted a meme comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler. That same month, Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum portrayed Musk as having exploited the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the American Jewish Committee asked Musk to apologize.


## China

Musk has praised China's economic and climate goals and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla. After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.²⁰⁷–²⁰⁸ In an interview in December 2020, Musk stated that based on his experience with the government of China, they have been "possibly more responsive to the happiness of people than in the U.S." On the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Musk praised China's "economic prosperity" and encouraged people to visit China.

In 2022, Musk wrote an article for the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, advocating for transition to sustainable and clean energy. His contribution was described by *The Verge* as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech due to the organization's enforcement of Internet censorship in China. In 2024, Musk described himself as "kind of pro-China", and a year later, during a visit to Beijing, he declared he was a "huge fan of China."

In December 2024, US Representative Rosa DeLauro declared that Musk had pressured House Republicans to remove a restriction on investment in China from a bipartisan government funding bill. Musk responded that DeLauro was an "aweful person" who "needs to be expelled from Congress." The following month, Musk stated that "the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China, is unbalanced".

In January 2025, Musk's relations with China were criticized by Republican Senator Tom Cotton in a book. Cotton wrote that Musk was too close to the Chinese government and too focused on turning a profit in China.


## Germany

In 2023, German politicians asserted that Musk was endorsing the Alternative for Germany (AfD), with Musk denying any support for the AfD. In December 2024, Musk tweeted in support of the AfD for Germany. and published an opinion piece supporting the AfD in the German newspaper *Welt am Sonntag*.

In January 2025, Musk held an interview on X with AfD leader Alice Weidel, ahead of the federal elections. Musk said that his views were shaped by personal experiences dealing with German regulation and his observations about its political culture. He subsequently made a surprise virtual appearance at an AfD event, describing the party as "the best hope" for Germany, while denouncing multiculturalism. According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk has been "souring" on Germany and its leaders long before December 2024. Tesla's sales in Germany during this time period fell 60%.


## Israel and Gaza

In a podcast interview in November 2023, Musk criticized Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip during the Gaza war, saying that Hamas "wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel." He also announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that users who use terms like "decolonization" and "from the river to the sea", or similar expressions that, according to him, imply genocide of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.


## Russia and Ukraine

Immediately following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Musk tweeted "Hold Strong Ukraine" and sympathized with the people of Russia, after which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Musk.

However, in October 2022, Musk changed his stance, suggesting that Ukraine should permanently cede occupied territories (e.g. Crimea) to Russia, and that Ukraine should drop its bid to join NATO. The four-part proposal, posted as a Twitter poll, suggested new referendums under United Nations supervision on the annexation of Russia-occupied territories. The proposal was welcomed by the Russian government and denounced by Zelenskyy as "pro-Russia", with officials stating that people who had been murdered or forcibly deported by Russia would be unable to vote.

According to American foreign affairs specialist Fiona Hill, Musk appeared to be "transmitting a message" for Putin. In *Politico*'s interview with Hill*,* she said that Musk's suggestion that Kherson and Zaporizhzhia be up for negotiation, and that the water supply for Crimea be secured, was specifically a message to Putin. Musk previously made a similar suggestion at a September event in Aspen, Colorado. Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.

In an email newsletter, Ian Bremmer, head of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy, said that Musk told him that he had spoken directly with Putin, which Musk denied in a reply on Twitter. Musk claimed he had spoken to Putin only once 18 months prior, on a space-related subject matter. Bremmer later took to Twitter to say Musk had told him two weeks earlier about the discussion with Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it "untrue", claiming Musk and Putin had only spoken about a year and a half before. In 2024, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Musk and Putin had been in regular contact since 2022. Peskov again stated that Musk and Putin have only had one telephone call in which they discussed "space as well as current and future technologies."

Since the Russian invasion in early 2022, Ukraine has been reliant on Musk's Starlink satellite internet service for communications. In 2023, Ukraine requested Musk enable Starlink up to Crimea for use in a counterattack against the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, from which missiles and drones have been launched towards Ukraine. Musk denied the request, expressing concerns about escalation. Musk's stance has been criticized in Ukraine because of the effect it had on their battlefield strategy. *The New York Times* underscored that Musk's actions had directly impacted Ukraine's attempts to defend itself and reclaim its territory.

In October 2023, Musk used a meme on X to mock Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. aid being sent to Ukraine. "So you have bought social media to bully people who are dying because [they] love freedom," Ukrainian stand-up comedian Anton Tymoshenko wrote in response.


## Taiwan

In October 2022, Musk suggested that Taiwan and China should "figure out a special administrative zone" arrangement as a potential resolution to Cross-strait relations, and the suggestion drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers. Chen Shih-chung commented that Musk had "brought about revolutionary change" and called on Musk to hold himself to the same democratic values regarding Taiwan." Chinese Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang thanked Musk for his suggestion.

In May 2023, when asked if he was concerned that China could attempt to take control of Taiwan, Musk remarked that "Taiwan should be integrated", according to the official policy of China, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted at Musk in response, and *China Daily* ran the headline "Elon Musk: Taiwan should be integrated". In September 2023, at the All-In Summit in Los Angeles, Musk again stated that Taiwan was part of China likening it to Hawaii, again receiving significant criticism, with Wu tweeting that Taiwan was not for sale, and U.S. congressmen Andy Ogles and Randy Weber published an open letter challenging Musk's interpretation of history and his exposure to the Chinese Communist Party. In 2024 Musk praised the quality of Taiwan's engineering talent.


## United Kingdom

In August 2024, after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said "large social media companies and those who run them" were contributing to the riots taking place in the country, Musk criticised him for not condemning all participants in the riots and only blaming the far-right. Musk also responded to a tweet which said the riots were due to "mass migration and open borders". His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. He further criticized Starmer for what he described as a "two-tier" policing system that did not protect all communities in the United Kingdom, and subsequently shared a conspiracy theory that Starmer's government was planning to build detainment camps in the Falkland Islands to hold far-right rioters. In response, Starmer stated his focus was safe communities and the importance of supporting police officers.

In December 2024, *The Times* reported that Musk was planning to donate $100 million to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party ahead of the next UK election, and may route the funds through X's UK branch to bypass donation laws. The following month, Musk called for a new election in the UK, saying "only Reform can save Britain". Musk has called for far-right activist Tommy Robinson be to be released from prison and supports the resignation of Nigel Farage as leader of Reform UK believing "doesn't have what it takes".

In January 2025, after Kemi Badenoch called for a national inquiry into group-based child sexual exploitation, Musk suggested Phillips was attempting to shield Starmer from blame since he led the Crown Prosecution Service when the abuse occurred. Musk's comments were criticised, and Phillips was defended by a group of victims of gender-based violence, including three survivors of the Telford child sexual exploitation scandal, as well as the Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Starmer, who said politicians and activists were "spreading lies and misinformation" over grooming gangs. Phillips said Musk was spreading "disinformation" that was endangering her. Musk also suggested Starmer was "complicit" in group-based child sexual exploitation. Starmer said politicians advocating for a second national inquiry were "amplifying" the far-right, and said those "spreading misinformation are not interested in the victims".
