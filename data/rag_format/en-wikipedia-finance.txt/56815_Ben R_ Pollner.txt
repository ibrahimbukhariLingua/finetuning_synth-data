Ben Pollner held various positions in industrial companies until joining the Steuber Corporation in 1970 when he commenced his international marketing, transport and trading activities in the bulk petrochemical industry.

### Oil for Food program

Pollner's company, Taurus Petroleum was responsible for over $4 billion in Oil-for-Food deals with Iraq. Under the program, oil was purchased from Iraq and resold to large refiners in exchange for food. Taurus and Gennady Timchenko and Torbjorn Tornqvist's Gunvor are the main two shareholders of the United States' Castor Group which includes both Castor Americas Incorporated and Castor Petroleum Limited with offices located at rue des Marches in Geneva.

Pollner, through his company Taurus Petroleum, purchased the majority of the oil from two companies in Geneva, Switzerland, Fenar Petroleum and Alcon Petroleum (both registered in Liechtenstein in 1999). Fenar and Alcon were among the largest oil purchasers under the Oil-for-Food program exporting a combined $2.47 billion in crude oil. It was alleged that Pollner in fact, either controlled or owned both companies. Fenar and Alcon were alleged to have funneled $18.9 million in kickbacks to the regime of Saddam Hussein, in the form of surcharges on oil purchases. Taurus has denied paying the surcharges. In response to the investigation, Pollner stated: "I did nothing in New York or the U.S. that would be considered illegal." Pollner was never indicted. Prior to answering questions from the Southern District of New York in 2004, Pollner moved to Switzerland.
