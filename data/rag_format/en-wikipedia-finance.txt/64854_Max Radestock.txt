**Max Radestock** (21 February 1854 - 10 January 1913) was a German consumer cooperative member (Konsumgenossenschafter) and the first chairman of the board of the *Central Association of German Consumer Associations (ZdK)*, founded in 1903.


## Biography

Max was born in Dresden. Orphaned at the age of 9 years, he left elementary school, to apprentice as a soap maker for his foster father's company. A local pastor noted his intelligence, and arranged for him at the age of 18 years to travel for three years across Germany. Her returned to Dresden to oversee a ceramics factory.

In 1885 he was elected to the board of the Consumer Cooperative (*Konsumverein*) of Pieschen. By 1892, he was the full-time director of this cooperative. In 1897, he became the director of the *Association of Saxon Consumer Associations*. In 1903, he became president of the *Central Association of German Consumer Associations* (or *Cooperatives*).

The *Consumer Cooperatives* were organizations founded in the latter half of the 19th-century, filling a niche in between the organizations led by large industrialists, such as the *General Association of German Employers and Business Cooperatives*; and labor-focused organizations led by Socialist-inspired theories. They tried to service the needs of small businesses, including farmers, and their workers.
