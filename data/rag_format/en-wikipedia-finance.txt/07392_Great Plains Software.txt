# Great Plains Software



**Great Plains Software, Inc.** was an accounting software company located in Fargo, North Dakota, whose products focused on small to medium-sized businesses. It was founded in 1981, went public in 1997, and was sold to Microsoft in 2001. Prior to its acquisition, it had 2,200 employees.


## History

The company was founded in 1981 by Joseph Larson, who also served as the company's first president. Doug Burgum, a future governor of North Dakota and U.S. presidential candidate, joined the company in March 1983 as a shareholder. He provided seed capital for the company and bought out the other investors in early 1984 and became its new president. Larson continued to serve as a director for the company until its acquisition.

The company grew to about 170 employees by 1987, and to around 290 employees by 1989. It earned about $300Â million in annual sales and a 1997 IPO, after using the Internet to help it expand beyond North Dakota. In 1999 the company acquired Match Data Systems, a development team in the Philippines. In 2000, after the company experienced several layoffs, it was acquired by Microsoft for $1.1 billion. The full purchase was completed in 2001. Its products continue to be offered as Microsoft Dynamics 365.
