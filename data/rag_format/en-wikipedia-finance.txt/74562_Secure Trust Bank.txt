**Secure Trust Bank** is a British retail and commercial banking group listed on the London Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the FTSE SmallCap Index.


## History

The bank was established in 1952 as Secure Homes Limited and became a subsidiary of the Arbuthnot Banking Group in 1985.

The company became Secure Trust Bank PLC in 1994 and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in an initial public offering in November 2011.

In 2015 the bank launched an asset finance division to enable it to offer lending to businesses.

In 2016 the Arbuthnot Banking Group reduced its majority stake from 51.9% to 20%, for about Â£145 million.

Later that year, the bank sold its consumer lending business Everyday Loans, reducing its position in UK's unsecured personal loan market.

In January 2021, Secure Trust Bank announced that CEO Paul Lynam would be stepping down with immediate effect, to be replaced by David McCreadie, a former Managing Director at Tesco Bank.

In March 2022, Secure Trust Bank announced it would be selling the Debt Managers business, which had bought some nine years earlier, to Swedish firm Intrum.

In May 2022, Secure Trust Bank completed the acquisition of BNPL start-up AppToPay which will operate as part of V12 Retail Finance to offer a BNPL style product alongside its traditional retail finance products.


## Operations

The bank offers a variety of savings accounts and consumer and business lending products. Motor finance is offered via hire purchase through its Moneyway brand, and hire purchase, personal contract purchase and dealership finance through the V12 Vehicle Finance brand.
