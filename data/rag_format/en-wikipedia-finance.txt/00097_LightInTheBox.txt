# LightInTheBox



**LightInTheBox Holding Co., Ltd.** is undergoing a strategic transformation. Transitioning from a traditional e-commerce platform, the Company is now focusing on developing proprietary brands and designing its own apparel collections. This shift aims to enhance product quality, strengthen brand identity, and improve profitability by offering unique, design-driven products that resonate with customers. A key initiative in this transformation is the launch of Ador.com, a women's clothing brand targeting women aged 35-55. The company is headquartered in Singapore and has additional offices in California, Shanghai, and Beijing.


## History

LightInTheBox was founded in June 2007. The company started with a registered capital of US$3 million. It operated as Light In The Box Limited until March 2008, when it was restructured and incorporated as LightInTheBox Holding Co., Ltd., acting as the ultimate holding company.

On June 6, 2013, LightInTheBox opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "LITB".


## Products and services

LightInTheBox is a global online retail company, providing a diverse range of affordable lifestyle products directly to consumers worldwide since 2007. In 2024, the Company shifted its focus to apparel design and launched its first proprietary brand, Ador.com, to meet the growing global demand for accessible higher-end fashion. Ador.com specializes in designer-quality clothing for women aged 35-55 at competitive prices and operates design studios and sample shops in both the U.S. and China, including a boutique and design studio in Campbell, California.
