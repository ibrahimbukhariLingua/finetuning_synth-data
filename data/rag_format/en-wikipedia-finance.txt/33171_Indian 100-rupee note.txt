# Indian 100-rupee note



The **Indian 100-rupee banknote** (₹100) is a denomination of the Indian rupee. It has been in continuous production since Reserve Bank of India took over the functions of the controller of currency in India in 1935. The present ₹100 banknote in circulation is a part of the Mahatma Gandhi New Series (which replaced the Mahatma Gandhi Series of ₹100 in 2018).


## History

The first 100-rupee note featured the portrait of George VI. After independence in 1947, Reserve Bank of India continued to issue the notes by replacing the portrait of George VI with the Emblem of India, as a part of the Lion Capital Series of banknotes.
