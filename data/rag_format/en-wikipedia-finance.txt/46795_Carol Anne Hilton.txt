## Career

Hilton is an international Indigenous business leader and award-winning author of *Indigenomics: Taking a Seat at the Economic Table* which was shortlisted for a Donner Prize in 2022. The title of the book comes from the *#Indigenomics* hashtag that she coined on Twitter in 2012. The book builds visibility of Indigenous economic worldview and addresses the common rhetoric and perception of Indigenous peoples and critiques the "economic displacement" of Indigenous People. Kevin Carmichael writing in the Financial Post calls it a "manifesto" and "revelatory", noting how it "forces non-Indigenous readers to confront the systematic exclusion of founding peoples from the country's economic life." Carmichael comparers her writing that of Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo. It was published by New Society Publishers.
