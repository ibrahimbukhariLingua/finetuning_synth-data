Midwest-China Hub Commission


# Midwest-China Hub Commission



The **Midwest-China Hub Commission** (MCHC) (Chinese: 美国中西部与中国战略经济发展委员会) is a public-private trade collaboration among St. Louis and Missouri governmental officials, business associates and China.


## History

In March 2008, the Commission signed two Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) (Chinese: 中国民用航空局) and Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) (Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部) to study a freight initiative.
The primary focus was to open a dialogue to create an economic hub to increase business and cultural exchanges between the two countries. The Commission has completed two studies related to current trade with China and China freight forwarding opportunities.

The Midwest-China Hub Commission was officially formed on January 21, 2009.

The Commission is formed by the voluntary involvement of State and local government and private entities, including:

* City of St. Louis and Lambert-St. Louis International Airport
* Civic Progress
* Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry
* Missouri Department of Economic Development (MODED)
* Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT)
* Missouri Partnership
* Organization of Chinese Americans St. Louis Chapter
* St. Charles County and Partners for Progress
* St. Louis County
* St. Louis County Economic Council (SLCEC)
* St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association (RCGA)
* World Trade Center - Saint Louis

In 1979, the first sister-city relationship between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China was established between St. Louis and Nanjing.


## Industry Business Councils

In December 2009, the Midwest-China Hub Commission and RCGA convened eight industry-specific China Business Councils to gain feedback from local businesses and leaders, help broaden the base of regional knowledge, and catalogue the breadth of business already occurring between the Saint Louis region and China. The Councils help to identify new opportunities for regional trade and backhaul.


## EB-5 Visas

As part of a strategy to encourage foreign investment in the St. Louis region and support international operations, the Midwest-China Hub Commission plans to establish an EB-5 regional center in the greater St. Louis area. The U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services EB-5 visa program requires potential investors to make qualifying investments ($500,000 or $1,000,000 minimums) and directly or indirectly create or save ten jobs.

The Gateway to the Midwest Investment Center (GMIC) became a non-profit EB-5 Regional Center as of September 27, 2010. Currently, the GMIC is not approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), but will gain designation in 2011.
