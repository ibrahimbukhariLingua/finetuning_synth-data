New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Woodworth


# New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Woodworth



***New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Woodworth***, 111 U.S. 138 (1884), was a U.S. Supreme Court case.


## The case

On September 21, 1869, Ann E. Woodworth took out a life insurance policy on herself with the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company in Michigan. Her husband Stephen E. Woodworth was the beneficiary. She then died in New York, and her husband moved to Illinois. The company did not pay the policy, and he sued in Illinois. The Illinois court passed judgment against the insurance company. The insurance company appealed saying that the suit should not have been filed in Illinois.

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the general rule that simple contract debts, such as a policy of insurance not under seal, are, for the purpose of founding administration, assets where the debtor resides, without regard to the place where the policy is found.
