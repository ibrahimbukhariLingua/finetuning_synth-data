Hainan Federation of Trade Unions


# Hainan Federation of Trade Unions



The **Hainan Federation of Trade Unions** (HNFTU; Chinese: 海南省总工会), a provincial branch of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), was formally established in April 1988 following Hainan's separation from Guangdong Province.


## History

Its precursors include the Qiongyabei Tin Miners' Union in 1939, which organized resistance against Japanese occupation forces in Hainan’s western highlands during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Post-1949, the union focused on state-owned agricultural enterprises like the Hainan State Farm Group in 1952, promoting labor efficiency campaigns in rubber and tropical crop production.

After Hainan's designation as a Special Economic Zone in 1988, the HNFTU mediated labor disputes in foreign-funded tourism and real estate projects, notably addressing wage arrears in Sanya's hotel industry during the 1990s. In the 2010s, it prioritized migrant worker integration through the Hainan Free Trade Port Labor Service Centers in 2020 and supported digital employment under the "Smart Hainan" initiative.
