# WeLion



**Beijing WeLion New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.**, known simply as **WeLion New Energy** or **WeLion** (Mandarin: 卫蓝; pinyin: Wèilán), is a Chinese battery manufacturer specializing in semi-solid and solid state batteries for use in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. The company is headquartered in the Beijing's Fangshan District, and is a spinoff from the Laboratory of Renewable Energy of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is best known for supplying the world's first mass produced semi-solid state battery cells for an automotive traction battery application, in the form of Nio's 150 kWh swappable battery pack.


## History

In August 2021, WeLion received a CN¥ 500 million (approximately US$78 million) investment from Geely, Huawei and Xiaomi. The investments are from Hubei Xiaomi Yangtze River Industry Investment Fund Partners (Changjiang Industrial Fund and Xiaomi fund launched in 2017) and Shenzhen Hubble Technology Investment Partners (a Huawei venture capital subsidiary), and Ningbo Geely Blue Initiative Business Management Partners (a Geely Holding Group subsidiary). The investments put WeLion's valuation at CN¥ 5 billion (approximately US$780 million).

On November 4, 2022 WeLion disclosed that it had secured CN¥ 1.5 billion (approximately US$209 million) in Series D financing.


## Partnerships


### Nio

On January 9 2021 at Nio's 'Nio Day 2020' event, Nio announced that a 150 kWh semi-solid state battery pack would later be made available. Later, it was revealed that WeLion would be the supplier of the battery cells. On June 30, 2023, Nio received the first shipments of the battery cells, and the packs first became available for rent by the public in mid-2024. The semi-solid state battery cells allow for a 50% higher energy capacity, with an energy density of 360 Wh/kg, in the same dimensions compared to a conventional pack, with only a minor 20-kilogram (44 lb) weight increase, allowing for a range of 1,050-kilometre (650 mi) range in the ET7 sedan.


### Tianqi Lithium

On May 20, 2021 WeLion signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Tianqi Lithium to form a joint venture. The aim of the joint venture is to develop, produce and sell lithium anode materials, and manufacturing equipment and ingredients for battery pre-lithiation processes.


### Ronbay Technology

In April 2022, WeLion signed a five-year agreement with Ronbay Technology for the supply of at least 30,000 tons of battery cathode materials. The agreement stipulates that Ronbay will be WeLion's primary supplier of high-nickel cathode materials for use in NMC chemistry solid-state batteries.


### JAC Yiwei

On April 22, 2024 WeLion and JAC signed an agreement for the supply of semi-solid state battery cells for use in Yiwei brand cars. The batteries will be cylindrical 4695 format cells, and will be used in Yiwei's second generation DI platform, with the first vehicle expected to launch in 2025.


### Longquan Energy Storage

On June 6, 2024 the Longquan Energy Storage project located near Longquan, Zhejiang was connected to the grid. The now operational first phase has a capacity of 200 MWh and an output of 100 MW and uses WeLion's semi-solid state cells, making it the world's first large scale use of semi-solid state batteries in a battery energy storage system context. The project is run by state-owned Power China, and is eventually planned to have a 400 MWh capacity and 200 MW output on the 40-acre site. It uses LFP solid-liquid hybrid electrolyte battery cells with a cell capacity of 280 Ah, energy density of 165 Wh/kg, a rated lifespan of 6000 cycles, and an operating range between −20–60 °C (−4–140 °F). Annual discharge is estimated to be over 60,000 GWh.
