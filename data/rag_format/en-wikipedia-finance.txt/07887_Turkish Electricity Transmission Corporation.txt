Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation


# Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation



**Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation** (Turkish: Türkiye Elektrik İletim A. Ş., abbreviated TEİAŞ) is the transmission system operator for electricity in Turkey. It is a government-owned corporation. It is planned for a minority stake to be sold to the private sector before the end of 2022. It reportedly does not co-ordinate with EMRA re YEKA bids as of 2023.


## History

In 2006, investigations were begun by ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators, into the technical conditions for the interconnection of the national grid of Turkey to the continental European power system. A trial period of interconnection commenced on 18 September 2010, and after the signing of long term agreements, the interconnection with Europe became a permanent arrangement.

There was a nationwide blackout in 2015.


## Operations

According to a study by Sabancı University 20% of Turkey's electricity could be generated from wind and solar by 2026 with no extra transmission costs, and 30% with a minor increase in grid investment.


## Subsidies

TEİAŞ distributes extra payments to some power stations in Turkey: some hydro is supported, but this "capacity mechanism" has been criticised as wasting money on too much capacity by supporting some coal fired power stations in Turkey.
