It consists of a single building on a 26-acre (110,000 m²) site. There are two entrances: one from the west on Damen Avenue, and one from the north near Blue Island Avenue. Traffic moves counterclockwise around the main building. The western side of the building is used for receiving, while the eastern side is used for loading.

CIPM is a focal point of food wholesale in Chicago, and several other food wholesalers are located within a mile radius.


## History

CIPM was built as the successor to South Water Market, which was located roughly 1-mile (1.6 km) northeast of the present site. By the late 20th century, South Water Market had unacceptable congestion and inadequate space.

On 10 July 2003, the Chicago Planning Commission granted its approval for the new site, which was developed by CenterPoint Properties anddesigned by Cornerstone Architects Ltd., Itasca, Illinois.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
