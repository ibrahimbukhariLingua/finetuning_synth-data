Cross-sector biodiversity initiative


# Cross-sector biodiversity initiative



The **Cross-Sector Biodiversity Initiative** (CSBI)] is a partnership between IPIECA - the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and the Equator Principles Association to develop and share good practices related to management of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the extractive industries.

The initiative supports the broader goals of innovative and transparent application of the mitigation hierarchy in relation to biodiversity and ecosystem services, as defined in the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources (2012).


## CSBI Charter and Governance

The vision and mission of the initiative are presented in its Charter developed and released by the 3 partner associations in 2013. CSBI is run by its member associations and volunteers from member companies and multilateral financing institutions, with the support of a part-time coordinator.
