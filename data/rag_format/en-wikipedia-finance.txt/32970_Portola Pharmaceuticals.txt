The company was founded on September 2, 2003, and named after Gaspar de Portolà, who was the first European to see San Francisco Bay. It completed an IPO on NASDAQ in May 2013.

The company developed P2Y₁₂ inhibitor Elinogrel, transferring rights to Novartis in 2009. The rights were returned in 2012 to Portola, which decided not to continue development.

In the class action lawsuit of *Hayden v. Portola Pharmaceuticals* in U.S. District Court, in the Northern District of California, before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, plaintiffs sued under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 alleging that the company and its underwriters misrepresented its financial position ahead of a 2019 securities offering. In November 2022, Judge Chhabria entered an order granting preliminary approval of the proposed settlement of the case in the proposed settlement amount of $17.5 million.
