## Early life and education

Blau was born and raised in Bayside, Queens, spending the first nine years of his life there before later moving to Woodbury, Long Island.

Starting at an early age, he spent summers working on job sites with his father, a builder and contractor, which sparked his love of real estate and development.

Blau attended and graduated from the University of Michigan. While in school, Blau teamed up with a local contractor to buy single-family homes in Ann Arbor and subdivide them into student apartments.

Blau signed up for a graduate-level real estate development class during his junior year. His professor introduced Blau to Stephen M. Ross when Ross delivered an address at a conference.

After Blau graduated from Michigan in 1990, Ross offered him a job at Related Companies. By that time, the market had crashed, leading Blau to attend the MBA at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania from 1990 to 1992, where he earned a Master in Business Administration in 1992. Blau commuted from New York to Philadelphia, taking classes while continuing to work at Related Companies.

Since being named CEO, Blau has overseen projects worth over $60 billion. He is most known for spearheading the development and opening of Hudson Yards. Originally a different developer had won the bid to develop the Yards, but backed out in 2008; Related immediately got back involved, with Blau saying he “essentially moved into the office and didn’t leave until the deal got done.” Currently, Blau is working on the company’s efforts to develop the Western Rail Yards, with Related proposing to build a 3 million-square-foot resort tower and 1,700 room hotel.
