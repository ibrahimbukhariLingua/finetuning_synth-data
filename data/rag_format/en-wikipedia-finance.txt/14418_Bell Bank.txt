Bell Bank, which employs more than 1,900 people, has 27 full-service banking locations in North Dakota, Minnesota and Arizona, and mortgage locations in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee and Wisconsin. State Bankshares is Bell Bank's parent company.


## History and growth

Bell Bank was founded as State Bank of Fargo in 1966 as a single location in the Northport Shopping Center in Fargo. Thomas "Buck" Snortland was one of the company's founders.

In 2003, the bank bought Northern Capital Trust, a trust company and flex spending adjudication business. Richard Solberg, who was then the bank's president and CEO, had served on the board of directors for Northern Capital Trust since the company was established—16 years before the merger.

Not long after the merger, Bell created a spin-off company called Discovery Benefits, which administers flexible benefits, COBRA and health savings accounts. Bell also started HealthcareBank, one of the largest health care savings account banks and a client of Discovery Benefits. In 2019, State Bankshares announced plans to sell Discovery Benefits for $425 million to Wex Inc., a South Portland, Maine-based payment processing and business solutions provider. In 2021, Bell and WEX agreed to WEX's acquisition of certain HSA assets of HealthcareBank.

In 2011, the company acquired Minneapolis-based Bell Mortgage, expanding its reach into the Twin Cities and Phoenix, Ariz. The company changed its name from State Bank & Trust to Bell State Bank & Trust in 2012 and to Bell Bank in Aug., 2016. In 2013, Bell acquired Minneapolis-based The Business Bank and its Prime Mortgage Division. Bell Bank Mortgage expanded its offices into Wisconsin and New Mexico in 2018, Florida, Missouri and Tennessee in 2019, and Kansas in 2020.

Bell launched an equipment finance division in Minneapolis in 2018, to serve the manufacturing, transportation, construction and agriculture industries.

In 2019, Bell signed a purchase agreement to buy Warner and Company Insurance in Fargo, Schiller Insurance in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, and Thompson-Schaefer Insurance Agency in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and rebranded them as Bell Insurance.

Bell opened its first full-service bank branch in Arizona—in the city of Chandler, Arizona—in 2019, and its second in Phoenix – Biltmore in 2020.

In 2020, Bell expanded into Forest Lake, Minn., and Duluth, Minn., renovating and occupying the downtown Temple Opera Building.

In 2021, Bell opened a branch in downtown Minneapolis' City Center and announced its entrance into the Denver market. Bell also purchased a 12-story building at 520 Main Ave. in downtown Fargo, which will reopen in 2024 after a full remodeling as Bell’s new headquarters.

In 2022, Bell finalized its building lease for a new mortgage servicing center in Owensboro, Ky. Bell also launched Bell Business Credit, a specialty lending team providing asset-based lending and factoring services for working capital intensive companies.

In 2024, Bell opened Bell Tower, its new, 190,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in downtown Fargo.

Bell has a 5-star rating from Bauer Financial, an independent bank research firm. Based on financial data from federal regulators, a 5-star rating, the highest rating the firm awards, means a bank is financially sound and is operating well above its capital requirements.

The company plans to remain privately owned.
