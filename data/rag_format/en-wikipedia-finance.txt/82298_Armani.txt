**Giorgio Armani S.p.A.** (pronounced [ˈdʒordʒo arˈmaːni]), commonly known as **Armani**, is an Italian luxury fashion house founded in Milan by Giorgio Armani which designs, manufactures, distributes and retails haute couture, ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, accessories, and home interiors. Among others, Armani licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear and L'Oréal for fragrances and cosmetics. It is considered Italy's third-biggest fashion group behind Gucci and Prada.

In addition to the couture line Armani Privé, Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani are the company's ready-to-wear lines that show at Milan Fashion Week. Selling at lower prices are Armani Collezioni, Armani Exchange and Armani Jeans.


## History

Armani and his partner, architect Sergio Galeotti, founded Giorgio Armani SpA in 1975, reportedly on money from the sale of Armani's Volkswagen.

Armani signed a license with Gruppo Finanziario Tessile (GFT) in 1978. The company also entered into a manufacturing and distribution license with Simint in 1991 when the company launched A|X Armani Exchange. By 1993, the Armani name was represented by 23 licensees and two large joint ventures in Japan.

By the 1990s, the company's strategy was to cancel licenses and take production in-house in a bid to exert more control over quality and distribution. Manufacturing arrangements later brought back in-house include the acquisition of Antinea (1990), Simint (1996) and Intai (1998). In 2000, after buying factories from GFT, Armani formed a joint venture with Zegna for the production and distribution of the Collezioni men's collection. Armani also increased to 85 percent of its share in the joint venture in Japan with Itochu.

In 2001, Armani commissioned architect Tadao Ando to transform an old Nestlé chocolate factory in Milan's Savona/Tortona area into the company's headquarters.

Also in the early 2000s, Armani opened five megastores designed by Massimiliano and Doriana Fuksas, starting with the opening of the Armani/Manzoni store in Milan in 2000, which carries all of the company's brands. Other such venues are in Hong Kong (Armani/Chater House, opened in 2002), Munich (Armani/Fünf Höfe, opened in 2003), Tokyo (Armani/Ginza Tower, opened in 2007) and New York City (Armani/Fifth Avenue, opened in 2009).

In 2002, Armani announced a new joint venture with the shoe manufacturer I Guardi, as part of a strategy of bringing manufacturing under its control. Beginning in 2007, the company teamed up with Samsung to develop a line of high-end electronic goods.

In 2007, Giorgio Armani confirmed to *Reuters* that he had been approached by Beiersdorf in 2005 about a potential merger but had since been too distracted by other projects to pursue that option. In 2016, he confirmed he had established the Giorgio Armani Foundation which, while aiming to fund social projects, is also to "safeguard the governance assets of the Armani Group and ensure that these assets are kept stable over time." As part of his succession plan, the foundation will own an undisclosed stake in the company, with the rest going to his family. By 2017, the company was seen as a prime candidate for a stock market listing. In 2021, Giorgio Armani ruled out merging with either LVMH or Kering and reportedly also ruled out an offer by Stellantis to acquire a minority stake.

In February 2020, Armani was the first fashion brand to decide to close its runway shows to the public amid the beginning COVID-19 pandemic, holding the event without an audience. By March 2020, all of its Italian production plants started producing single-use medical overalls.

In 2021, luxury yacht maker The Italian Sea Group announced that Giorgio Armani SpA would invest in the company's IPO at the Italian Bourse.

Despite promising to suspend investments in Russia, Giorgio Armani continues to operate in the country amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the brand held a silent Milan Fashion Week show in February 2022 as a "sign of respect" for Ukraine, it has not reduced its activities or signaled plans to exit the Russian market. This ongoing presence has drawn criticism as international sanctions target Russia for its aggression and the killing of civilians in Ukraine. Giorgio Armani is among several European companies that remain operational in Russia, sparking questions about their ethical and corporate responsibilities during the conflict.

## Controversy

In 1999, the *New York Times* and others raised concerns about a generous donation made by Giorgio Armani SpA to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York shortly before the museum announced that it would pay homage to Armani himself with a major retrospective of his work.

In a 2014 report, Greenpeace publicly criticized Armani and other luxury brands after having found traces of chemicals that can pollute waterways in children's clothing and shoes; in response, the company committed to abolishing all chemicals that could cause environmental damage to production sites by 2020. Also in 2014, Giorgio Armani SpA paid 270 million euros to Italian tax authorities to settle a dispute over payments from the group's subsidiaries abroad.

In 2015, Giorgio Armani Corp's former general counsel Fabio Silva filed a $75 million lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court against the company, accusing it of discriminating against him because of his Mexican origins and firing him for having cancer.

On July 17, 2024, the Italian competition authority, Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), announced the launch of an investigation into Armani and Dior. The probe aims to determine whether these companies potentially misled consumers regarding their labor practices and supply chain management. Prosecutors claim to have discovered workshops on the outskirts of Milan where mostly illegal immigrant workers sold products to Armani as well as Dior for a fraction of their retail price.
