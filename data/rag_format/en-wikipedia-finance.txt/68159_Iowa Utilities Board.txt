Iowa Utilities Board


# Iowa Utilities Board



The **Iowa Utilities Board** (**IUB**) is a three-member public utilities commission, with beginnings in 1878. It is a quasi-judicial tribunal, which regulates services and rates of electric, natural gas, water and telecommunication providers, as well as all pipelines and transmission lines in the U.S. state of Iowa and has existed with its present name since 1986.


## History


### 1878–1986

In 1878 the *Iowa Board of Railroad Commissioners* was founded, whose three members were publicly elected for a two-year term. In 1911, an *Office of Commerce Counsel* was established within, which with increasing electrification took on the regulation of transmission lines. In 1937, it was renamed the *Iowa State Commerce Commission*.

It was only in 1963 that the regulation of rates and services of all public utility companies (electricity, natural gas, water and telecommunications) became Iowa State Commerce Commission tasks. At the same time, the legislature extended commissioner terms to six years and the positions became appointed.
In 1986, the state renamed the commission as "Iowa Utilities Board".


### 21 st century

In August 2023, the IUB held hearings regarding Summit Carbon Solutions proposal to build 700 miles of carbon capture pipeline in Iowa for carbon generated by ethanol plants to underground storage in North Dakota., one of three companies planning such a project. In June 2024, the IUB approved the controversial Summit pipeline including eminent domain to force non cooperative landowners.
