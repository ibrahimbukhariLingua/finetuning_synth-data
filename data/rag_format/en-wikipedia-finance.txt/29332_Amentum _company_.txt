# Amentum (company)



**Amentum Holdings, Inc.** (formally **Amentum Government Services Holding LLC**) is an American government and commercial services contractor based in Chantilly, Virginia. The company was formed in 2020 from the spinout of AECOM's Management Services / federal group. After Leidos, it is the second-largest government services (non equipment producing) contractor in the US government contracting market.


## History

Amentum was founded in 2020 as a spinout of the Management Services Group of AECOM, consisting of the non-construction parts of the company's federal work as well as its commercial operations and maintenance business. This came as a result of a process by AECOM to realign its business to focus more clearly on the architect, engineering, and construction market.

Amentum traces its AECOM roots back to several well-known government contracting firms that now form the basis of its current work. These firms came to be a part of the company by way of AECOM's acquisition of URS Corporation and include EG&G, Washington Group International, Westinghouse Government Services, and Lear Siegler.

On the 27th September 2024 Amentum announced the completion of its merger with Jacobs Solutions Inc Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber and Intelligence businesses.

On October 1st, 2024, Amentum became a publicly traded company on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "AMTM", becoming a part of the S&P 500.
