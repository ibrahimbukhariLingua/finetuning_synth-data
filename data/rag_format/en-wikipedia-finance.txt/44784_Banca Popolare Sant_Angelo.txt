In 1997, the bank was ranked 9th (2.79%) in terms of deposits (Italian: *raccolta*) market in the whole region, which ranked 4th in the Province of Agrigento (8.92%) and in the Province of Caltanissetta (8.27%), behind Banco di Sicilia (including Sicilcassa), BMPS, BCC G.Toniolo di San Cataldo (Caltanissetta only) and Sanpaolo (Agrigento only).

In 2000 the bank signed a bancassurance partnership with Cattolica Assicurazioni. The insurer also owned an equity interests in BP St.Angelo (0.42% in 2012).
