Seabird Airlines


# Seabird Airlines



**Seabird Airlines** was an airline operating scheduled seaplane services in Istanbul, Turkey, and the surrounding area. Its main base was at Haliç on the Golden Horn. It was the only floatplane operator in Turkey. It also operated sightseeing flights over Istanbul.


## History

The airline was established in Istanbul in 2010 by Kürşad Arusan (chairman of the board) and the German Angel Investor Christian Theisen, although it took a further two years to get all the required certification from the Turkish aviation authorities. It is part of the Burulas Havacilik Group. It ceased operations in June 2015, citing financial difficulties, most likely driven by a drop in wealthy Russian tourists (source: http://www.todayszaman.com/business\_seabird-airlines-sputters-to-a-halt\_387464.html)
