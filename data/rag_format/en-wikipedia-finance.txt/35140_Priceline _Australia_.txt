Priceline (Australia)


# Priceline (Australia)



**Priceline** is an Australian health and beauty retailer. The Priceline brand has two store types; a traditional Priceline and Priceline Pharmacy. It is owned by Australian Pharmaceutical Industries, (API) which was acquired by Wesfarmers in 2022.


## History

Priceline was established in 1982; the first store opened at Highpoint Shopping Centre, and started as a beauty retailer. In 2004 Australian Pharmaceutical Industries acquired the New Price Retail business which operated the retail brands of Priceline, Priceline Pharmacy, House, and Price Attack. API divested its House and Price Attack chains in 2007 to focus its retailing strategy on the Priceline brand. In 2008 Priceline launched a brand re-positioning with a new visual identity, store format and merchandise. This is when the livery changed to the recognisable magenta pink shade synonymous with the Priceline brand. In November 2021, Priceline was included in the sale of Australian Pharmaceutical Industries to Wesfarmers.

## Loyalty program

Priceline's loyalty program, Sister Club, has over 8.4 million members, making it one of the largest retail loyalty programs in Australia. Members earn points when making purchases and are rewarded with discount vouchers and prizes. Sister Club members accounted for more than 40% of retail sales in 2009, with the average Club member sale more than 30% higher than for a non-Club customer.


## Industrial relations case

In 2007, Andrew Cruickshank, a store layout planner, was dismissed from his job from Priceline for 'operational reasons' under the WorkChoices Legislation. He alleged Priceline fired him on his $101,000 a year contract, replacing him with someone on a $75,000 contract. Priceline claimed otherwise, saying "It was not the same role...the person wouldn't have been capable of doing the same things". The Australian Industrial Relations Commission ruled in favour of Priceline and found that Cruickshank's termination resulted from Priceline's financial difficulties and the subsequent decision to reorganise its structure.


## Class action lawsuit

A potential class action lawsuit in 2021 was being planned by law firm Levitt Robinson on behalf of Priceline franchisees. The class action, centred around control of the pharmacies, faced trouble initially when the litigation funder withdrew. The lawsuit was discontinued in 2022 after too few franchisees joined the class action.
