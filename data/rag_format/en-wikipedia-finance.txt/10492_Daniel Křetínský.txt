## Career


### Early career

In 1999, Křetínský joined J&T as lawyer and became a partner in 2003. Since 2004, he has been the chairman of football club Sparta Prague and he is believed to be its 40% shareholder.

When J&T founded Energetický a průmyslový holding in 2009, he became its chairman and 20% shareholder. He ceased to be a partner of J&T. In 2011, he became chairman and 60% shareholder of EP Industries, that was divested from EPH. In 2016, he took 94% ownership of EPH through a series of transactions including EPH's sale of a 30% stake in subsidiary EPIF where the proceeds were used to buy out other shareholders. As of 2022, EPIF owned 49% of Eustream [sk], a Slovak gas transmission system operator which piped Russian gas to central and eastern Europe.

Since 2014, he has been one of the owners of Czech media house Czech News Center which published the tabloid *Blesk*.


### 2018–2020: French company purchase

In October 2018, staff at *Le Monde* learned that Křetínský had purchased 49% of Matthieu Pigasse's stake in the company. *Le Monde*'s Independency Group, a minority shareholder that aims to protect the paper's editorial independence, had not been informed of the sale, and asked Pigasse and Křetínský to sign an "approval agreement" that would give the Independency Group the right to approve or reject any controlling shareholder. As of September 2019ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, they had not done so.

On 12 March 2020, Jérôme Lefilliâtre, a French journalist, published *Mister K, Petites et grandes affaires de Daniel Kretinsky* (Le Seuil Editions), an investigative book about the Czech billionaire.

On 16 September 2020, his holding company, Vesa Equity Investment Sarl, announced a 3.05% holding interest in the shares of J Sainsbury plc, a major supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. By November, Křetínský's holding company Vesa Equity Investment Sarl also became the largest shareholder of Foot Locker.


### 2021–2022

On 10 November 2021, English football club West Ham United announced Křetínský and his colleague Pavel Horský had acquired 27% of the shares of the club, both becoming directors.

On 25 August 2022, Royal Mail in the United Kingdom was notified by the British government that Křetínský's Vesa Equity Investment Sarl, the then single largest investor of Royal Mail, had plans to increase its shareholding to more than 25%. This triggered intervention and a British government review by Kwasi Kwarteng the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Business under the National Security and Investment Act. On 31 October 2022, the Secretary of State for Business approved Křetínský's intention to increase Vesa's shareholding in Royal Mail (owned by parent company International Distributions Services).


### 2024

In April 2024, the owner of Royal Mail, International Distribution Services (IDS), received a takeover approach from Křetínský. The 320p-a-share offer was rejected by IDS. However, on 29 May, the owners of Royal Mail accepted an offer of 360 pence a share. Křetínský has committed in writing to honouring the Universal Service Obligation for five years. The acquisition, worth £3.6 billion, was approved in December 2024, with the UK government retaining a "golden share" in Royal Mail.

A consortium led by Křetínský will own and control 53.7% of the share capital of French retailer Groupe Casino. In June, ThyssenKrupp announced that the start of reconstruction of the struggling Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe will take place over the summer and that Daniel Kretinsky wants to take a 20% stake without layoffs.


### **2025**

In February 2025, EP Global Commerce GmbH ("EPGC"), a holding company controlled by Křetínský which holds approximately 49.99 percent of the voting rights in METRO AG, entered into a delisting agreement with company and issued a revocation of the admission of METRO AG shares to trading on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.


### Strategy

In a speech in 2015, Křetínský said: "We want to make money in industries that are dying because we think they'll die much more slowly than the general consensus says."


## Personal life

Křetínský is dating Anna Kellnerová, the daughter of his business associate Petr Kellner, who was the richest man in the country.

In 2015, he acquired the Heath Hall mansion in London for £65 million, featuring 15 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, a cinema, and a tennis court.
