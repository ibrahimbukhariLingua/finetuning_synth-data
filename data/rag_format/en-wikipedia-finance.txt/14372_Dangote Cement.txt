## Acquisition of Obajana cement factory

The management of Dangote Industries Ltd. (DIL) claims that it fully owns the Obajana Cement Plant and that all legal procedures were followed in its 2002 acquisition.
The company made this claim in a statement headed "Obajana Cement Plant: Separating Facts from Fiction" and released by Anthony Chiejina, Group Head Branding and Communications, DIL.
Because it questioned Dangote Cement's ownership of the firm, the Kogi State government closed the Obajana plant. Tax payment difficulties were also brought up by the administration.
The Obajana Cement Plant, one of the major taxpayers and the vehicle for one of the largest corporations with investments from hundreds of Nigerian and foreign investors, is regarded by the group as one of the most important elements of economic activity in the country.
The firms claimed: "Dangote Industries Limited (DIL), pursuant to the legally binding agreement it entered into with KSG to invest in Kogi State, bought the property on which the Obajana Cement Plant is built alone in 2003, well after it had acquired the shares in the Obajana Cement business in 2002.
"After paying the required costs and compensating the landowners, DIL received three Certificates of Occupancy in its name.
"Again, well after it had purchased the shares of the Obajana Cement Company, DIL was fully responsible for the conception, design, acquisition, construction, and payment of the plant and machinery.
