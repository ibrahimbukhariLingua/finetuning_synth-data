Ecuadorian peso


# Ecuadorian peso



The **peso** was a currency of Ecuador until 1884.


## History

Peso was the name of the 8 real coins circulating in Ecuador since the Spanish colonial period. In 1856, the currency was pegged to the French franc, with 1 peso = 5 francs. From 1862, paper money was issued denominated in reales and pesos. The peso was formally adopted as the currency of Ecuador in 1871, replacing the real at a rate of 1 peso = 8 reales. It was subdivided into 100 centavos. In 1884, the peso was replaced by the sucre at par.


## Coins

The only coins issued between 1871 and 1884 were 1 and 2 centavos, struck in cupro-nickel at the Heaton mint in Birmingham. These coins continued to circulate after the sucre was adopted.


## Banknotes

Paper money was only issued by private banks. The *Banco Particular de Descuento I Circulación de Guayaquil* issued notes between 1862 and 1866 in denominations of 2 and 4 reales, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. The *Banco del Ecuador* issued denominations of 2 and 4 reales, 1, 4, 5 and 10 pesos between 1868 and 1887. Some 1 and 5 peso notes were later overprinted for use as 80 centavo and 4 sucre notes, due to a conversion rate of 5 pesos = 4 sucres for the notes of this bank.

The *Banco de Circulación y Descuento* issued 4 real and 1, 4, 5, 10 and 20 peso notes in the 1860s, whilst the *Banco Nacional* issued notes in the 1870s in denominations of 2 and 4 reales, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 pesos. The *Banco de Quito* issued notes in denominations of 2 reales, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 pesos between 1874 and 1880, the *Banco de la Unión* issued notes between 1882 and 1893 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 pesos, and the *Banco Anglo-Ecuatoriano* issued notes in 1884 for 1, 5 and 10 pesos.
