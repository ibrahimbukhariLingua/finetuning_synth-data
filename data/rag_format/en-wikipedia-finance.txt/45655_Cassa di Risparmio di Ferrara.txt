## History


### Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara

Found in 1838 by Count Alessandro Masi, **Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara** was one of the oldest savings bank (Italian: *cassa di risparmio*) after Bologna (since 1837), Spoleto (since 1836; renamed and relocated in 2012; closed 2016) and Rome (1836; now defunct) in the Papal States (but not in the whole Italy). From 1927 to 1942 the bank acquired Cassa di Risparmio di Copparo, Banca Mutua Popolare di Bondeno, the local mount of piety of Ferrara (found 1508), Banca di Portomaggiore, Monte di Credito su Pegno di Comacchio and Banca Popolare Cooperativa di Argenta. An Italian law enacted in 1927 requires the savings bank to merge with bigger bank if it was under a certain size.

In December 1991, the bank daily operation and ownership also split into a *società per azioni* and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara (Fondazione Carife).

In 1994 the group acquired Banca di Credito Agrario di Ferrara. In 2002 the bank acquired Commercio e Finanza – Leasing e Factoring as well as Banca di Treviso (the latter was sold to Banca Popolare di Marostica in 2010), Banca Popolare di Roma [it] and Credito Veronese (Creverbanca) in 2003. In 2004 the bank acquired Finproget. In 2005 Banca Modenese and Banca Farnese (some branches of the latter was sold to Banca Centropadana in 2014) were acquired. In 2008 Banca di Credito e Risparmio di Romagna joined the banking group. In 2012, Carife would be merged with its subsidiaries: Banca Popolare di Roma, Banca Modenese, Banca di Credito e Risparmio di Romagna and Finproget.

The 4 banks were the first bail-out in Italy since Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive was in force in Italy. The Bank of Italy was the national resolution authority of the Single Resolution Mechanism.

The Italian National Resolution Fund had also injected a further €1.7 billion in total to the 4 banks to cover the losses.
