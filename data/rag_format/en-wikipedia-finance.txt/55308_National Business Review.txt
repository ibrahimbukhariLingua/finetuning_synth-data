National Business Review


# National Business Review



The ***National Business Review*** (or ***NBR***) is a New Zealandâ€“based online news publication aimed at the business sector.
It has journalists in Auckland, Wellington, Canberra and Sydney.


## History

The *NBR* was founded in 1970 by then-23 year old publisher Henry Newrick. Initially published as a fortnightly tabloid-format newspaper, it was briefly published as a daily newspaper from 1987 to 1991. New Zealand businessman Barry Colman was the *NBR's* publisher for 24 years, after buying it from John Fairfax & Sons in 1988. He sold it to Todd Scott in 2012.

The publication's website has a paywall model, where businesses and individual subscribers pay to access certain content. As of June 2016, the *NBR* had more than 4000 paying subscribers. The *NBR* launched an online radio platform in March 2015, NBR Radio, and in early 2018 it launched a video-on-demand platform provided by Shift72, NBR View. In 2020, the NBR ceased printing and became an online newspaper.


## The NBR List

The publication produces an annual *The Rich List* with the estimated wealth of the richest New Zealanders. In 2020, Todd Scott announced that *NBR* had "called off the 2020 NBR Rich List" due to the economic impact of COVID-19, saying it would be "vulgar" to focus on wealthy people. Today, NBR produces "The NBR List" which focuses on NZ's top wealth creators and philanthropy in New Zealand.
