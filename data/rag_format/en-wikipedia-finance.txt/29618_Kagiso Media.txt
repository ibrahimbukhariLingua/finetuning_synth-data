## History

Kagiso Media was listed on the JSE in 1997.

In 1999, Kagiso acquired a 42.5% investment in radio station Jacaranda 94.2. It had a 91% stake in East Coast Radio and 24% stake in OFM that year and a stake in Caxton publishing.

By 2000 it owned Radmark, a radio advertising company, Butterworths, a publishing business, and exhibition businesses, Saitex, Auto Africa and the Rand Show.

In November 2000, a deal was proposed to merge Kasigo with Primedia which would give it 40% stake. The deal required approval from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) as the two groups owned radio stations that would place them in ownership of more than what was allowed by the regulatory authorities. The merger fell apart in March 2001 after Primedia failed to dispose of its noncore assets and Kasigo step away from the deal.

Another attempt was made in May 2001 by New Africa Investments Limited when it announced a proposed takeover of Kasigo Media's business operations and assets. Primedia issued an objection to the Icasa concerning the New Africa Investments Limited acquisition of Kagiso Media. In January 2002, Icasa blocked the takeover based on ownership rules.

Kagiso, part of a consortium called Johnnic Communication (Johncom), made a conditional bid for the assets of New Africa Investments in September 2003. In late September, their conditional bid was accepted by the Nail board. But by early October, the Tiso Capital consortium outbid the Johncom offer. Competition Commission approved the Tiso bid in January 2004 but recommended that Nial's radio assets be sold.

In 2005, Kagiso increased its stakes in radio station Jacaranda and radio advertising firm Radmark.

As well in 2006, Kagiso purchased a further stake in Jacaranda Radio bring its ownership to 80 percent. Later that year in September 2006, a leadership change occurred when CEO Roger Jardine became an executive director and Murphy Morobe was appointed Kagiso's new CEO.

May 2007, saw Kagiso purchase a 50.1 percent stake in Clear Channel Merafe, an outside advertising company and would be renamed Kagiso Outdoor. But sold it 2008. At the end of 2007, Kagiso Media owned 80 percent of the Jacaranda radio station, 100 percent of East Coast Radio and 24.9 percent stake in OFM. Other radio stations in its portfolio included a 33.3 percent each in Heart FM and iGagasi FM and a 25.1 percent stake in Kaya FM.

In January 2008, Kagiso Exhibitions & Events was put up for sale after the sale of the Rand Show event back to the Johannesburg Expo Centre. Its sale was finalised in 2009.

Other acquisitions in 2008 by Kagiso included Acceleration Media, an electronic media planning and strategy agency. In an overseas venture outside of Africa, it partnered with Primetime International in India in 2008 to form RadioMinds. Further acquisition purchases by Kagiso in 2008 saw the purchase of a 50 percent stake in Mobil Alliance whose interests are sport sponsorship and digital technology advertising. and a controlling interest in Urban Brew, company involved in television production.
