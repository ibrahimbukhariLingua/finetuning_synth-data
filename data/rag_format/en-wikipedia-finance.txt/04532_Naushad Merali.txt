Upon introduction of Socialist principles in Tanzania that were then unfavourable, Merali later moved to Nairobi in 1969 and completed high school at Highway Secondary School. Merali then attended a college of accounts and finance at a college on Oxford street in London.

Merali started his business career in his 20's as a finance clerk of Ryce Motors in Nairobi in the 1970s, later buying the company from its retiree owner at 24 using a bank loan of $2,350 from Bank of America in 1975, today known as Commercial Bank of Africa Group.
