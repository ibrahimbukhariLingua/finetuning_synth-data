# Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services (constituency)



The **Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services** functional constituency was in the elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong first created in 1995 as one of the nine new functional constituencies under the electoral reform carried out by the then Governor Chris Patten, in which the electorate consisted of total 171,534 eligible voters worked in the services sector related to finance, insurance, real estate and business in Hong Kong.

The constituency was abolished with the colonial Legislative Council dissolved after the transfer of the sovereignty in 1997.

A similar Insurance functional constituency was created for the 1998 election by the HKSAR government with a much narrow electorate base which restricted to only less than 200 insurers.
