**UltraTech Cement Limited** is an Indian multinational cement company based in Mumbai.

## History

UltraTech Cement traces its origins to 1983 when it began as the cement division of Larsen & Toubro (L&T), being sold under the "L&T Cement" brand. In 2000, L&T decided to sell its cement business and incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary to house the cement assets.

In 2001, Reliance Industries sold its entire 10% stake in L&T to Grasim Industries. At the time, L&T was the largest cement manufacturer in India, while Grasim was the third-largest. In 2002, Grasim would increase its stake in L&T to 15% and its attempt to launch an open offer to acquire an additional 20% stake was stayed by the SEBI over a possible violation of takeover rules.

In 2003, L&T announced that it would demerge the cement business into a company called UltraTech CemCo. As part of the demerger plan, Grasim agreed to acquire an 8.5% stake in UltraTech CemCo from L&T, make an open offer to acquire another 30%, and transfer its 15% stake in L&T (residual engineering company) to L&T Employees Welfare Foundation. The deal was executed in 2004, with Grasim obtaining management control of UltraTech CemCo (later renamed as UltraTech Cement) with its 51% stake, while L&T retained 11.5% shareholding.
