## Investment strategy

Focusing on investments within the online sector, Catcha Group’s investment strategy involves looking at ideas that have worked in more mature markets and looking at how they can be brought to emerging markets, particularly Southeast Asia. In an interview with e27.co, Catcha Group's Group CEO Patrick Grove has said “We like to bet on ideas where the concept is already proven. Our only risk is execution risk, we don’t like to bet on idea risk.”

Two further pillars of the Group's investment strategy include the use of mergers & acquisitions as a driver of growth and the public markets as a vehicle for this. Speaking in an interview with BRW, Patrick Grove was quoted as saying: “In an industry that moves so fast, the way to get market share fast is to acquire rather than start from scratch."

Today, Catcha Group focuses on providing growth equity and mentorship to tech entrepreneurs looking to take their companies public, leveraging the Group’s public markets and corporate transactions experience.
