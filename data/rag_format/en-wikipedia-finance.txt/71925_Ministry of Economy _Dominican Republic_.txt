Ministry of Economy (Dominican Republic)


# Ministry of Economy (Dominican Republic)



The **Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development** (Spanish: *Ministerio de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo* or *MEPyD*) of the Dominican Republic is a government institution which coordinates the country's macroeconomic politics and sustainable development. It regulates the National System for Development and Public Investment, controls the statistics programs, evaluates the impact of economic actions, establishes the international cooperation politics, among other roles.

It was created on 2006 as the *Secretaría de Estado de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo*. Its headquarters are located at Santo Domingo. Since July 11, 2022, its Minister is Pavel Isa Contreras.


## History

Since 1965, development and economic planning politics in the Dominican Republic were in charge of the **Technical Secretariat of the Presidency** (Spanish: *Secretariado Técnico de la Presidencia*). On 2006, the office was replaced by the **Secretary of State of Economy, Planning and Development** (*Secretaría de Estado de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo*), as established by the Law no. 496-06 of December 28, 2006.

This process was the result of a legal transformation of the Dominican public administration, in order to strengthen the country's economic development. At the same time, the government reorganized the National System for Development and Public Investment (*Sistema Nacional de Planificación e Inversión Pública*) to face the economic and social development in an equitable manner.

It adopted its current name, **Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development** (*Ministerio de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo*), after the 2010 Constitutional reform and the subsequent Decree no. 56-10 which changed the names of all government agencies.
