## History

Chard (1964) Ltd operates as Chard Coin and Bullion Dealer. Established in the resort town of Blackpool in 1964 by Lawrence Chard, the company at first traded shillings and other coins from Chard's grandmother's amusement arcade, but over the years Chard amassed a vast collection of world coins, coin sets, bars, medallions, stamp replicas, and other currency and collectibles. Chard's provides freely available numismatic, bullion and investment advice to coin collectors and investors in person or via its websites.

In 2014, Chard Coin and Bullion celebrated its 50th anniversary with a move to 32-36 Harrowside, Blackpool. The art deco building was gutted and rebuilt to provide security.


## Service

Chard sells its items, including physical bullion, in its Blackpool showroom and on its website. Chard specialises in British gold sovereigns and has over 5,000 dated and graded sovereigns in its collection. In addition to precious metals, Chard also deals in bullion, numismatic material and scrap gold.

Chard was awarded the UK Bullion Dealer of the Year award by Bullion Directory in 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. It has also been named Numismatic Dealer of the Year and eCommerce Dealer of the Year multiple times.
