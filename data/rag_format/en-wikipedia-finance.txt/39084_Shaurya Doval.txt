## Politics

In 2014, Doval was a planner for the $1.5m public reception for the newly appointed Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi by the Indian American community at Madison Square Garden during his 2014 state visit to the US which was attended by 20,000 people.

He formally joined Bharatiya Janta Party in Uttarakhand as a special invitee in the party's state executive members' meet in 2017. He became the party's convenor for good governance in the state. Political analysts speculated that he might contest the 2019 Indian general election from the Pauri Garhwal seat of Uttarakhand. In April 2019, Z security protection was provided in response to potential security threats against him and his father during the elections.

According to a 2017 report by *The Wire*, since 2014 Doval's think tank had become the most influential in India. It alleged that he had a conflict of interest as four of the directors of India Foundation were appointed as ministers in 2014 including Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and they continued to be Directors in India Foundation even after joining the government. It questioned the Foundation's opaque sources of funding. Doval claimed that it raised money through "conferences, advertisement[s], [and] journal[s]" and that "no foreign funding has ever been received", however *The Wire* noted its conferences were sponsored by international companies such as Boeing and DBS Bank.

In 2019, *The Caravan* alleged inexplicable ties between the businesses of Doval and his younger brother Vivek who allegedly ran a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands. This was taken up by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh in a press conference on 17 January 2019.

A subsequent criminal defamation case was filed by Vivek Doval against Ramesh, *Caravan* magazine and its staff writer who Doval claimed had used "inferences and innuendos" to give the impression that he and his family were involved in money laundering and round tripping. In December 2020, Jairam Ramesh apologised in court for "any hurt the statements may have caused".
