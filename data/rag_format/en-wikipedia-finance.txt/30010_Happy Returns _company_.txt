# Happy Returns (company)



**Happy Returns LLC** is an American software and reverse logistics company that works with online merchants to handle product returns. Purchased items can be returned in person without boxes or labels at third-party locations known as "Return Bars" including The UPS Store, Staples Inc., , and Ulta Beauty stores, with specific locations searchable on Happy Returns’ website. Consumers can receive their refunds without packaging items, printing and affixing labels, or waiting for mailed packages to reach their destination.

The company facilitates returns for many brands, including Levi's, Revolve, Everlane, Lands' End, Gymshark. Amazon later developed a similar program in conjunction with Kohl’s stores to accommodate its shoppers.

Happy Returns aggregates and ships returns from its return locations to warehouse hubs, where returns are sorted, processed, and dispositioned, and then bulk shipped back to merchant warehouses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Waste is reduced because shoppers do not need to use a new box to ship out returns.
