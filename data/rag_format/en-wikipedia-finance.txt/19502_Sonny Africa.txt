## Career and Advocacy


### Economic Analysis and Public Policy

Africa has been notably active in providing critical analysis of Philippine economic policies and government statistics. He is known for his methodological approach of using government's own statistics to challenge official narratives and provide alternative analysis of economic conditions.

At the annual 'Birdtalk' forum held at the University of the Philippines Diliman in January 2024, Africa raised significant concerns about government claims regarding economic growth, emphasizing the need for more nuanced analysis of economic indicators.

Under his leadership, IBON Foundation has advocated for more realistic poverty measurements, particularly calling for a reassessment of the food poverty threshold to better reflect actual living conditions in the Philippines.


### Transportation Policy

Africa has been a significant voice in the discourse surrounding the Philippine government's Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) modernization program. In early 2024, he provided analysis on the potential impacts of jeepney modernization, warning about projected fare increases and reduction in available transportation routes. His analysis suggested that minimum jeepney fares could reach â‚±50 within five years under the modernization program.


### Labor and Employment Analysis

Under Africa's leadership, IBON Foundation has conducted extensive research on Philippine labor markets and employment quality. His work has highlighted concerns about job quality versus quantity in the Philippine economy and the need for improved labor policies to address economic slowdown.
