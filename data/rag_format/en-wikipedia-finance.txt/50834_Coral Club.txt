## History

In 1998 the company opened its first office in Toronto, Canada.

In 1999 Erik Megrabyan partnered with Leonid Lapp and became a co-owner of Coral Club. Rolf Eriksson, the owner of Alka-Mine worldwide, transferred the exclusive rights to sell Coral-Mine (Alka-Mine) to Coral Club the same year.

In 1999 Royal Body Care, which in 1996 acquired Light Force, founded by Christopher Hills, became the partner of Coral Club.

In November 2000 Coral Club increased its market presence.

In 2008 despite the crisis, the turnover of the Coral Club continued to exhibit steady income growth compared to 2007. In the same year, the company's owners, Leonid Lapp and Erik Megrabyan, arranged the development of the products under their brand exclusively. Coral Club distributor partners increased by 25% in 2008.

In 2020 Coral Club owned 288 offline stores and delivered products to 175 countries. The product range includes more than 170 health, beauty, and home products made in the USA, Canada, Germany, Armenia, Norway, France, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Russia.

## Business Model

Coral Club uses direct selling and network marketing with a multi-level compensation system as a business model and networking. Coral Club's marketing plan gives the possibility to be rewarded based on monthly turnover.

The company also operates an academy to improve the skills of partners.


## Research

Goncharuk et al. studied the effect of Coral Club’s method of activating water with coral calcium on the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of drinking water. The study found that treating water with coral calcium shifts its ORP into the negative region, reaching values as low as –200 mV. For example, water with an initial ORP of 150 mV can drop to –50 mV after treatment. This shift aligns with the optimal ORP values for the intercellular fluids of body tissues, reducing the energy required by cells to adjust ORP and allowing more energy to be directed towards intracellular processes.
