## History

Lanka Tiles was incorporated on 30 March 1984. The company was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange two years later. Lanka Tiles and its present parent Lanka Walltiles were parts of the government-owned Ceylon Ceramics Corporation. In 1987, the company exported 80% of its production. In line with the government policy of privatisation, all but one division of Ceylon Ceramics Corporation incorporated as Lanka Ceramic Limited in 1991. When the government divested its stake in Lanka Ceramic, Ceylon Theatres acquired 65% of the stake. Lanka Tiles was renamed Lanka Floortiles after the acquisition.

Workers of the company launched a strike action in August 2010, demanding a pay increase. The strike action was resolved after 19 days following successful salary negotiations with the trade union. 450 workers out of a 580-cadre strike again in 2011. The workers agreed to abide by the collective agreement. A consortium led by Royal Ceramics acquired 80% of Lanka Tiles's parent Lanka Ceramic in May 2013, bringing Lanka Tiles under the Vallibel One Group. With the acquisition, Royal Ceramics gained a near-monopoly of the Sri Lankan tile market. Lanka Tiles invested LKR200 million to export mosaic tiles to the United States in 2019. The company signed an agreement with the Chinese firm Foshan Shiwan Yulong Ceramic and Benjamin Malloy. The agreement was signed when the United States government imposed an anti-dumping duty on ceramic products of Chinese origin. In the same year, Lanka Tiles expanded its contract manufacturing in India to combat cheap imports from India. A few years earlier, the company signed an agreement with Ambani Vitrified to manufacture glazed vitrified tiles.
