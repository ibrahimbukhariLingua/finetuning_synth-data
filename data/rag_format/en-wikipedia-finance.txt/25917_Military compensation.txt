Military compensation


# Military compensation



**Military pay** or **military compensation** is the pay system whereby members of the military are compensated for their participation in the military.

As parts of government pay systems, military pay typically does not compete with private military compensation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Because military service requires fit soldiers and commitments that might reach well beyond civilian employment, governments typically provided additional health care, military housing and retirement or veteran's benefits.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
