## Service

CGTrader runs an online 3D model marketplace for 3D designers and CG industry-related buyers.
Freelance 3D designers, design companies and 3D modeling hobbyists upload their works, set up descriptions, images, video previews (optional) and pricing. Uploaders should also select one of the categories - CG, low poly or 3D printing - and provide more technical details about their models. Buyers can choose from several file formats (if uploaded by 3D modellers). CGTrader allows buyers to communicate with model authors directly. Buyers interested in 3D models can also bid their price and negotiate with designers. Alternatively, buyers can post job offers and order custom models in a 3D job board.

The digital files of the purchased models can be downloaded from the system directly or following the link delivered via email. For 3D printing ready models, there are several options such as buying the model itself or paying to stream it to a 3D printer.

In May 2019, the company introduced CGTrader ARsenal for online retailers. Designed for 3D product visualization for eCommerce.


### Royalty system

As of September 1, 2016 sellers get from 70% to 80% royalties of the price listed or negotiated with the buyer. The royalty rates applied are based on reputation system: new users start from Beginner level and can rank up to Legendary level with royalty rates changing accordingly. Reputation points are collected by the means of community interactions, referrals of new users as well as assigned based on quality ratings of models uploaded, number of model sales and other actions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
