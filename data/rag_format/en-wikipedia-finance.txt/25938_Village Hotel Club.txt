Village Hotel Club


# Village Hotel Club



**Village Hotels** is a hotel business founded in 1995 that operates 33 hotels in the United Kingdom. After being controlled by Denver-based private equity firm KSL Capital Partners, the company was purchased in 2024 by The Blackstone Group.


## History

The company dates back to 1976 when bedrooms were added to Hyde Squash Club, near Manchester, by John Burrows to create Village Hotel and Leisure Club. Other hotels were added in Bury and Cheadle before the business was sold to Boddingtons brewery, which was bought in 1996 by its rival Greenall's.

In March 2014, Village Urban Resorts was acquired from De Vere Group by KSL Capital Partners for £435 million as part of the group disposal with sale proceedings being used to payback debts of over £1.75 billion.

Following the reopening of all Hotels after the Coronavirus Pandemic in May 2021, the decision was made that all Village Spas would remain permanently closed. Most Spas have been removed and the space now being accommodated by additions to the Leisure Club.

In Late 2021 the final stages were completed for the removal of the American themed Italian Restaurant - Buca Di Beppo

It was announced on 26 June, 2024 that Village Hotels had been bought by private equity giant The Blackstone Group. It's the groups second foray into the UK hotel market after it purchased Bourne Leisure which owns Warner Leisure Hotels in 2021.
