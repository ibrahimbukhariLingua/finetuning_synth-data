**Conquest Mining** was a mining company based in Australia. In September 2010, it bought a 40% stake in the Pajingo mine in northern Queensland. Conquest is also developing a silver-gold-copper resource at Silver Hill and is involved in a number of other goldmining projects. The executive chairman is Jake Klein.

In late 2011 Conquest Mining Ltd merged with Catalpa Resources Ltd to form a mid-tier Australian gold producer, Evolution Mining.
