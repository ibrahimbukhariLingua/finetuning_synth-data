Yihaodian is a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce website that provides people with a platform to shop groceries online. Yihaodian has “virtual stores” that exhibit images of stocked grocery shelves on walls and other surfaces in urban public areas in China, which passersby can scan codes under the images with a mobile device to purchase corresponding groceries online. The retail giant Walmart first invested in Yihaodian in 2011; in 2012, it announced additional investment so that Walmart controlled 51% of Yihaodian’s ownership.

## History

The two founders, Gang Yu and Junling Liu were both former executives at Dell before they established Yihaodian.com. Gang Yu was the vice-president of Worldwide Procurement, while Junling Liu was the president of Dell China. Besides that, before joining Dell, Gang Yu had also acted as the vice-president of Global Supply chain at Amazon, and Junling Liu had been the vice-president at Avaya China. Both of them accumulated rich experiences and management skills from their previous jobs. In 2007, Gang Yu and Junling Liu suddenly announced their resignation from Dell and began to prepare for their own business.

In 2008, e-commerce market in China was dominated by e-commerce companies like Alibaba.com, Taobao and Dangdang. They seized domains in e-commerce respectively: Alibaba for "business-to-business", Taobao for "consumer-to-consumer" and Dangdang for "business-to-consumer". Gang Yu and Junling Liu accurately analyzed the situation of e-commerce in China and they eventually decided to develop the business-to-consumer (B2C) market by introducing a specialized category, "commodity", to the marketplace. Consequently, Yihaodian.com was launched in July 2008.
