**Acosta, Inc.** is a sales and marketing agency currently headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. Their clients include Clorox and Coca-Cola, among others.


## History

Acosta was founded in 1927 by Lou Acosta. Founder Louis “L.T.” Acosta opened L.T. Acosta Company, Inc. This family-run, single-market food broker served the greater Jacksonville, Florida area for 50 years before it expanded across the Southeast.

An office in Tampa was opened and the service area expanded to central Florida. Expanding beyond Jacksonville in 1977, Acosta opened offices in Alabama, Georgia and Florida, which set the stage for continued growth. In 1981, Acosta opened a local office in Miami, Florida. In the 1980s, Acosta's operations spread throughout the southern United States. This included local franchises in Georgia through a 1983 acquisition of Raley Brothers, North Carolina and South Carolina in 1989, and later franchises in Louisiana, Tennessee and Virginia.

Acosta participated in multiple consolidations with other food retailers, manufacturers and procurement centers. By the mid-1990s, the company was servicing 27 markets and employed over 2,000 people. These merges included:

* PMI-Eisenhart in July 1998
* Kelley-Clarke in June 1999
* the MAI companies in August 1999
* Luke Soules in July 2003
* C. Lloyd Johnson Company, a military sales agency, in 2008

From 2010 to 2017 Acosta focused on diversifying its services and expanding its national footprint via the acquisition of FrontLine Marketing, multiple foodservice agencies, Anderson Daymon Worldwide, Mosaic Sales Solutions, George Food Marketing, Etherton, Lenhart & Associates, The Pet Firm and ActionLink.

In December 2019, Acosta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in efforts to eliminate long-term debt. The company's international operations were not included in the filing. The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2020 after shedding $3 billion of debt.

From 2021 through 2022, Acosta created CORE Foodservice and acquired Impact Group, Premium Retail Services and Amazon agency OeP, signaling a new dawn in the company’s history.
