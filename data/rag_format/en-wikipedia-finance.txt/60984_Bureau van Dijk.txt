### History

The origin of Bureau van Dijk dates back to the 1970s. Belgian businessman Marcel van Dijk established a company specialising in documentary and information systems, named "Bureau Marcel van Dijk". In 1972, its activities were further deployed in the two companies established in Paris and Brussels.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1985, on the retirement of Marcel van Dijk, Professor Bernard van Ommeslaghe and Alain Liedts took over the company and extended its operations to include management consulting, auditing and IT support. In 1987, Bureau van Dijk took the pioneering role in Europe by launching a new activity: the design and dissemination on CD-ROM (the precursor to Bureau van Dijk's online databases) of economic and financial databases with information on companies.

In 1991, a second company, "Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing", was formed to assume responsibility for updating and expanding these databases, while the consulting division remained grouped within the company Bureau van Dijk Ingénieurs Conseils. The owners of Bureau van Dijk were private individuals who were also members of the management and board, and the company has since been sold.

Candover acquired a 60% stake in Bureau van Dijk in 2004 after founder and chairman Bernard Van Ommeslaghe, who was 70, decided to sell part. The other 40% was then thought to be owned by the management.

Bureau van Dijk was then sold to Charterhouse Capital Partners in July 2011, backed with 505 million euros of leveraged loans, including 365 million euros of senior loans and 140 million euros of mezzanine debt maturing in 2019. In July 2014, EQT AB purchased Bureau van Dijk from Charterhouse backed by an 845 million-euro equivalent leveraged loan financing. In early 2015, Swedish pension fund Sjätte AP-fonden (AP6) bought a 3% stake in Bureau van Dijk, through a direct co-investment.

In May 2017, Moody's Analytics announced its intention to buy the company for 3 billion euros, which was completed in August 2017.
