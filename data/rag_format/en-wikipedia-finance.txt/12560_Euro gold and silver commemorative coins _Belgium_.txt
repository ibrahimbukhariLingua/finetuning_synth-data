Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)


# Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)



**Euro gold and silver commemorative coins** are special euro coins minted and issued by member states of the Eurozone, mainly in gold and silver, although other precious metals are also used in rare occasions. Belgium was one of the first twelve countries in the Eurozone that introduced the euro (€) on 1 January 2002. Since then, the Belgian Royal Mint have been minting both normal issues of Belgian euro coins, which are intended for circulation, and commemorative euro coins in gold and silver.

These special coins are only legal tender in Belgium, unlike the normal issues of the Belgian euro coins, which are legal tender in every country of the Eurozone. This means that the commemorative coins made of gold and silver cannot be used as money in other countries. Furthermore, as their bullion value generally vastly exceeds their face value, these coins are not intended to be used as means of payment at all—although it remains possible. For this reason, they are usually named **Collectors' coins**.

The coins usually commemorate the anniversaries of historical events or draw attention to current events of special importance. Belgium mints five of these coins on average per year, in both gold and silver, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euros. All the coins were designed by Luc Luycx.


## Summary

As of 3 July 2008, 27 variations of Belgian commemorative coins have been minted: two in 2002, two in 2003, four in 2004, four in 2005, six in 2006, six in 2007, seven in 2008 and two in 2009 so far. These special high-value commemorative coins are not to be confused with €2 commemorative coins, which are coins designated for circulation and do have legal tender status in all countries of the Eurozone.

The following table shows the number of coins minted per year. In the first section, the coins are grouped by the metal used, while in the second section they are grouped by their face value. Data from years 2020 to 2024 were sourced from Belgian Federal Public Service.

| Although his well-known protagonist, Detective Inspector Maigret, was Parisian, Georges Simenon was one of the most famous Belgian writers of the 20th century. With more than 200 novels, most of them translated into several dozen languages and more than fifty adapted for television and the large screen, he has left a large collection of masterpieces behind. Two of them, *My Friend Maigret* (1949) and *Maigret in Court* (1960) were named in 1987 as two of the hundred best crime novels. For his work particularly on police novels, Belgium has chosen to honor the centennial of his birth (13 February 1903) with a 10-euro sterling silver commemorative coin. The obverse front side shows his portrait. The reverse shows a map of the European Union as of 2003. "Belgium" in the three official languages is displayed as well as the nominal value of 10 euro, surrounded by the 12 stars of the union. | | | | |

| The obverse of the coin shows the two faces of the "Germinal Franc", a currency established in 1803.

| The female character Europa, abducted by Zeus, watching the continent from the skies, is shown on the obverse of the coin. The continent Europe has ultimately been named after this female character. In the eighth century, ecclesiastical uses of *Europa* for the imperium of Charlemagne provide the source for the modern geographical term. The name of Europe as a geographical term came in use by Ancient Greek geographers such as Strabo. It is derived from the Greek word *Europa* (Ευρώπη) in almost all European languages. Europa has been used frequently as a symbol of Europe; statues of her and the bull, are placed outside several European Union institutions. On the reverse of the coin, "Belgium" in the three official languages is displayed as well as the nominal value of 10 euro, surrounded by the 12 stars of the union. | | | | |

This was the largest single enlargement in terms of people and landmass, although the smallest in terms of GDP. To commemorate this remarkable event, the Belgian mint minted this gold commemorative coin. The obverse shows ten famous landmarks, each of them located in one of the ten new members of the European Union, surrounding the euro symbol with the 12 stars of the union.

Born in 1547, Lipsius came to be known for his writings on stoicism. The most famous of these was entitled *De Constantia* ("On Constancy"), and in it he spoke of the merits of a Stoic-inspired ideal of constancy whenever people were faced with unpleasant events or circumstances. His teachings led to a philosophical movement known today as "Neostoicism". Lipsius died in 1606. The obverse of the coin features an image of Lipsius, surrounded by the inscription of his name and the dates 1547–1606. The reverse shows a map of Europe as one continent. "Belgium" in the three official languages is displayed as well as the nominal value of 10 euro, surrounded by the 12 stars of the European Union.

At the time of the incident, 274 people were working in the colliery *Bois du Cazier*, also known as *Puits Saint-Charles*. A wrongly placed mining wagon on the elevator cage hit an oil pipe and indirectly the electricity lines when the elevator started moving. This caused a fire, which trapped the miners working in the galleries. Only 12 people survived. The obverse shows a portrait of a miner, with the mine *Bois du Cazier* in the background. In one version of the coin, the portrait of the miner is minted in copper, which gives a unique character to this coin. | | | | |

| This coin was issued to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Maurice Maeterlinck's greatest contemporary success: *L'Oiseau Bleu*, written in 1908. Maurice was a Belgian poet, playwright, and essayist writing in French. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1911. The play premiered on 30 September 1908 at Constantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre and has been turned into several films and a TV series. The story is about a girl called Mytyl and her brother Tyltyl seeking happiness, represented by The Blue Bird of Happiness, aided by the good fairy Berylune. This coin features on its obverse the image of the blue bird spreading its wings and leaving the confines of its cage for freedom. The unusual aspect of this coin is that the bird itself is actually colored in blue (as in the name of the play). Above the bird are the years signifying the 100th anniversary of the Blue Bird play, 1908–2008, and above that is the emblem for the Europa series. In a semicircle around the top rim of the coin is the name of Maurice Maeterlinck, while around the bottom are the words, in French and Dutch respectively, for The Blue Bird. The reverse shows a clear view of all the countries of the Eurozone, surrounded by the word "Belgium" in the three official languages and the face value of 10 euro. | | | | |
