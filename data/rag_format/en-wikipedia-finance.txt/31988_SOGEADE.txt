# SOGEADE



**SOGEADE** (**Société de gestion de l'aéronautique, de la défense et de l'espace**) was a French intermediate holding company. It was dissolved in 2013.


## History

SOGEADE was created solely to hold French interests in the newly founded EADS (Airbus), as an intermediate holding company, which were owned by the state of France (through SOGEPA) and Lagardère Group (Désirade). In 2005, SOGEADE had the same shares holding ratio with Daimler AG for 29.9%.

In 2006 Daimler and Lagardère agreed to sell 7.5% shares each to the open public. In 2007 Daimler agreed to sell 7.5% shares of Airbus to Dedalus while Lagardère issued mandatory exchangeable bonds for the 7.5% shares of Airbus to Natixis. In 2013 the French State's portion of ownership was transferred to SOGEPA, while SOGEADE became the wholly owned subsidiary of Lagardère. Soon later Lagardère sold all the shares.
