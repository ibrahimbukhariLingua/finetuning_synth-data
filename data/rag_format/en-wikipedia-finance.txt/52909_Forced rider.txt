* In many European countries, every household is required to purchase a television licence whether they watch television or not.
* Childless adults are required to pay for the public education of others' children. Additionally, parents whose children are not using the public school system, such as those enrolled in private or charter schools in the US, are still required to pay for other children's public education, as well.

### Forced riders in private property

* In a unionized workplace, non-union as well as union members are required to pay dues to the union representing the workplace as a condition of employment. This is the case in agency shop union security agreements.
