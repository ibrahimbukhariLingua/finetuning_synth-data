## Official Spree extensions

Extensions are the primary mechanism for customizing a Spree site. They allow Spree developers to share reusable code with one another. Extensions simplify the process of adding features to ecommerce websites. Spree extensions include utilities for product subscription, asset management, marketing, admin reports, roles and permissions, gift cards & promotions, delivery slots, item returns, social media marketing, and one-page checkout.


## Spree Commerce multi-vendor marketplace

Spree also features a multi-vendor marketplace, which allows the operators of e-commerce sites to act as sales platforms for 3rd party vendors. This is managed by means of an extension.


## Spree Commerce history

On July 1, 2011, Spree received $1.5 million in seed funding from AOL and True Ventures. On February 25, 2014 Spree raised an additional $5M in Series A funding led by Thrive Capital. Also participating were Vegas Tech Fund (led by Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh), Red Swan (led by Bonobos CEO Andy Dunn) as well as existing investors True Ventures and AOL Ventures.

On September 21, 2015 it was acquired by First Data. After the First Data acquisition, developers from Spark Solutions and VinSol now maintain and develop the Spree Commerce Open Source project. Vinsol also develops Spree extensions.

In 2016 an OpenCommerce Conference was held in New York to showcase the newest e-commerce projects running on Spree.

In 2021 Spree changed its model from a monolithic e-commerce platform to an API-first application allowing non-Ruby developers to customize and run Spree applications. JavaScript SDK also became available.
