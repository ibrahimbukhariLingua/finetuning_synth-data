## Analysis

Strategic analysis:
1. The group has a unique business model with presence in entire value chain from Fibre to Fabric this gives it the company the flexibility to reorganize their business effectively during down turns and ramp up faster than competitors when the economy is buoyant.
2. The group has a large cotton inventory holding capacity thus helping it to control its supply chain operations and thereby absorb fluctuations in market demand.
3. In order to build a competitive advantage, the group has been continuously working on improving its capabilities continuously and diversifying from its core Yarn and fabric business. The groups foray into Steel is a good example of this.
