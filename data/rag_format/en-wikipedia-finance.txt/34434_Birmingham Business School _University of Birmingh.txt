Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)


# Birmingham Business School (University of Birmingham)



**Birmingham Business School** **(BBS)** is the business school of the University of Birmingham in England. Established in 1989, the school traces its history back to the School of Commerce founded in 1902, leading to it sometimes being identified as the oldest business school in the United Kingdom. Edgar Meyer was announced new dean in June 2023.


## History

In 1901, Sir William Ashley took the first Chair of Commerce at the school, where he fostered the development of its commercial programme. From 1902 until 1923 he served as the first Professor of Commerce and dean of the faculty, which he was instrumental in founding.

Ashley said that the aim of the new faculty was the education not of the "rank and file, but of the officers of the industrial and commercial army: of those who, as principals, directors, managers, secretaries, heads of department, etc., will ultimately guide the business activity of the country".

In its first year, the annual costs of the faculty, including staff salaries, were £8,200. There were six students, a lecture room and two classrooms. By 1908, fifteen men had graduated from the school.

However, the teaching of the time was not grounded in academic research and lacked a theoretical basis, damaging the reputation of Birmingham and other schools of commerce. With a drop of in demand from industry for commerce graduates in the 1930s, professors were not replaced and staff burdens grew to the extent that it fuelled opposition to business and management teaching at other universities, including Oxford and Cambridge. By the late 1940s, the teaching in schools of commerce such as Birmingham was mainly economics. Alexander Carr-Saunders, the Director of the London School of Economics, referred to the Birmingham Bachelor of Commerce as "an economics degree in all but name".

After World War 2, there was a push to establish business schools in the UK along the general lines of those in the US, but it was not until the Franks Report of 1963 that the government committed funding to opening two business schools, in Manchester and London. This led to the establishment of business schools and MBA courses not only at these two schools but also in places such as Durham, Warwick and Strathclyde; these 1960s schools are often regarded as the first business schools in the UK. However, it was not until 1985 that Birmingham revived its business education and opened an MBA course. Birmingham Business School was formed in 1989 by the merger of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Accounting and Finance.

In March 2005, University House was officially opened by Sir Dominic Cadbury as the Business School's new £20m home. In 2008, the School expanded to add the Department of Economics to its list of departments that already included Accounting and Finance; Management; Marketing.

A brand new £10m postgraduate teaching centre, the Alan Walters Building officially opened in December 2016.
