## History


### Early business

Bert N. Mitchell and Robert Titus formed a partnership in 1974, establishing Mitchell & Titus, LLP. In the late 1970s, the firm targeted not-for-profit, community-based organizations receiving federal grants from the Great Society programs. Among the first large not-for-profit clients were the Economic Commission of Nassau County (New York), and Recruitment and Training, Inc. of the A. Philip Randolph Institute.

In 1978, Mitchell & Titus broke new ground by pioneering joint venture projects with the then "Big Eight" accounting firms. The firm entered a joint venture agreement with KPMG Peat Marwick to conduct New York City's first independent audit. The firm also opened its Washington, D.C. office in 1979 to be better positioned for government contracts. Joint ventures and minority participation contracts attributed to the firm's growth throughout the late 1980s, during the time when the "Big Eight" became the "Big Six".


### Relationship with larger accounting networks

The relationship with Ernst & Young began in the early 1980s with a joint venture relationship, which included the joint audit of the City of New York for many years. In 1986, Mitchell & Titus established a management consulting division to attract commercial clients and take part in the growing consulting industry.

Mitchell & Titus joined Ernst & Young Global Limited as a member firm in 2006; its membership ended effective October 30, 2015.

On March 9, 2017, Mitchell Titus joined the BDO Alliance USA, a nationwide association of independently owned local and regional accounting, consulting and service firms under the BDO USA, LLP umbrella.
