## History

Shop 'n Save was established in 1968 as one of the nation's first discount grocery stores, Shop 'n Save offers name-brand and private label products. The stores are supplied by the distributor SuperValu, which licenses the name. SuperValu entered the Pittsburgh market in 1977 by acquiring wholesaler Charley Brothers. The Charley family continue to be Shop 'n Save licensees.

In March 2010, Shop 'n Save launched an online cookbook called Our Kitchen Stories. The cookbook is geared at recording the recipes and culinary traditions of people of the Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, and Northern West Virginia region.

In 2017, as part of the required divestitures for the merger of Royal Ahold and Delhaize Group, a number of Delhaize-owned Food Lion locations in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland that were located in close proximity to Ahold-owned Martin's stores were sold to Supervalu and rebranded as Shop 'n Save. These stores operate independently from the legacy stores based in the Pittsburgh area.
