**BECU** is an American credit union based in Tukwila, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area. It was named the **Boeing Employees' Credit Union** for much of its history and originally served employees of The Boeing Company. Membership was later expanded to all residents of Washington and some counties in Oregon and Idaho. As of 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the credit union has 60 locations—primarily in the Puget Sound region of Western Washington—and 1.4 million members making it the largest credit union in Washington and fourth largest in the United States.

The Fellowship Credit Union was established in 1935 by 18 Boeing employees. Originally, BECU was only open to past and present employees of the Boeing Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, BECU itself, and the Museum of Flight. In 2002, membership was opened to those who live, work, or go to school in Washington state or certain Oregon or Idaho counties. As of December 2021, BECU had over $30.2 billion in assets and over 1.3 million members as of December 2021. Beverly Anderson is the current President and CEO.

On November 2, 2017, BECU changed its logo, replacing the 'cursive E' logo that had been used by the organization since the late 1980s, with a sans-serif logo.
