# Woodwind & Brasswind



**Woodwind & Brasswind** is the largest online retailer of band and orchestra instruments in the United States. Formerly based in South Bend, Indiana, the company today serves customers exclusively through their website and call center.


## History

Originally founded in 1978 as The Woodwind, the store was established in a converted barbershop in South Bend, Indiana, and marketed its products via a hand-typed flyer that was mailed to 350 music teachers in the Midwest.

In the 1980s, The Woodwind expanded its product offering to brass instruments and became The Woodwind & The Brasswind. Outgrowing the original location, the company moved into a larger location with a retail store, a warehouse, and a dedicated call center to support its mail-order business. In the 1990s, the number of call center agents increased from 12 to 75, and the company launched its first website.

On April 1, 1999, the company relocated to 4004 Technology Drive in South Bend and simplified its name to The Woodwind & Brasswind. The company's retail store at the new location was the largest musical instrument store in the region.

In 2002, Woodwind & Brasswind acquired Music123.com, a New Jerseyâ€“based online retailer of musical instruments and equipment, and hired Music123.com founders Stephan and Richard Zapf. In 2004, Woodwind & Brasswind terminated the Zapf brothers, beginning a two-year legal dispute concerning the terms of the acquisition and the brothers' employment. The resulting verdict was unfavorable to Woodwind & Brasswind, causing the company to default on various loans and payable accounts. On November 21, 2006, Woodwind & Brasswind filed for bankruptcy protection.

On November 28, 2006, Guitar Center offered $37.1 million for the purchase of Woodwind & Brasswind. A few weeks later on December 6, Steinway Musical Instruments offered $40.1M for acquisition, but subsequently announced on its Investor Relations page on January 16, 2007 its intention to terminate its asset purchase agreement with Dennis Bamber Inc. d/b/a/ Woodwind and Brasswind. Guitar Center purchased the assets of Dennis Bamber, Inc., D/B/A The Woodwind & The Brasswind in an agreement dated January 30, 2007.

In 2011, the company closed its South Bend retail store and warehouse, and announced its intention to transfer its call center employees to Indianapolis by the end of the year.
