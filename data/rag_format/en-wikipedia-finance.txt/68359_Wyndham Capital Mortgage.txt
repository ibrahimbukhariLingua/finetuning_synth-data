Wyndham Capital Mortgage


# Wyndham Capital Mortgage



**Wyndham Capital Mortgage Inc.** was an American mortgage company based in Charlotte, North Carolina, providing residential mortgage loans through a direct-to-consumer, online lending model. The company was acquired by San Francisco-based personal finance company, SoFi, in April 2023.

Wyndham Capitalâ€™s utilized online technology to serve its customers and loan officers. However, unlike a number of other lenders that used online technology, Wyndham Capital processes, underwrites, closes, and funded all of its loans internally. The loan process was paperless, through a secure loan portal with e-signature technology that helped to streamline the loan process.

Before being acquired in 2023, Wyndham Capital was one of only 11 LendingTree Certified Lenders Nationwide. It was also the only lender on LendingTree's network with 100% of its Professional Mortgage Consultants certified.

The company had Professional Mortgage Consultants licensed in a number of different states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.


## History

The founder Jeff Douglas had the idea for this company while working as an account manager at LendingTree from May 2000 to March 2001. During that period, the online mortgage business was growing exponentially, and he saw an opportunity in this business to combine industry leading rates and fees with the level of service expected from a neighborhood lender. In launching Wyndham, Douglas adopted an aggressive strategy of offering interest rates below those of other lenders, reasoning that the company could make up the difference by facilitating a higher volume of loans. In 2002, the company became part of LendingTree's network of lenders, where it became one of the Top 20 lenders. In 2004, the company started to invest in an automation process, creating a completely paperless workflow by the year 2005. This helped to minimize its environmental footprint and create a better efficiency for loan transactions.

In 2008, the company changed its business model from a mortgage broker to a fully operational mortgage banking center that would process, underwrite, close, and fund all of its loans internally. The change proved successful and the company managed to grow considerably during a slow market period (429% growth in the years 2009 - 2012, from $8.4 million revenue to $44.4 million). Jeremy Abig, the CFO who redefined the business model, won the 2012 Small Private Company CFO Award with the Charlotte Business Journal.

The company was acquired by San Francisco-based personal finance company, SoFi, in an all-cash deal on April 3, 2023.
