Vyšehrad (steamboat)


# Vyšehrad (steamboat)



***Vyšehrad*** is one of the last two remaining operating steamboats on the Vltava River in Prague, Czech Republic, and belongs to the Prague Steamboat Company.

*Vyšehrad* was built in 1938 during the company's modernization in the 1930s when new boats were being bought and old ones modernized. Her original name was *Antonín Švehla* (a politician of the First Republic). Type-wise the *Vyšehrad* was similar to then a decade old steamers *Dresden* and *Leipzig* that belonged to SBDA Company (situated in Dresden).

It has been renamed at several points in history – *Karlstein* in 1942, T.G. Masaryk after World War II and *Děvín* in 1952. In 1992 it was completely renovated and renamed *Vyšehrad*. The most recent reconstruction took place in winter 2006–2007 in Laubegast shipyard in Dresden.


## Technical details

*Vyšehrad* is 62 m long and 6.2 m wide, 10.5 over the paddleboxes. It has a 165 kW (220 k) engine. Originally it could carry 885 passengers; nowadays it is 300, and 199 of them can be seated. Its maximum speed is approximately 17 km/h.


## Modern usage

At first *Vyšehrad* was used on a route between Prague and Vrané nad Vltavou (a little town about 10 km (6.2 mi) south of Prague). During World War II she served in Dresden as a field kitchen; after the war she was returned to Prague. In the 1970s *Vyšehrad* was used on the route between Prague and Štěchovice. Since the 1992 reconstruction she is used mainly as a restaurant boat and a boat for private cruises.
