**Visana**, based in Bern, is a Swiss insurance company specialized in health insurance and accident insurance.

As of 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the company served around 848,000 privately insured people and 16,500 insured companies, authorities and associations. In 2022, the Visana Group generated a premium volume of 3.6 billion Swiss francs with 1,450 employees.


## History

The company emerged in 1996 as a result of the fusion of the three health insurance funds KKB (founded 1870), Grütli (founded 1872) and Evidenzia (founded 1990) with the implementation of the new health insurance law.

In 1998 the company made headlines in eight cantons. In reaction to this, the Federal Department of the Interior announced that it would "prevent Visana to be withdrawn from basic health insurance in individual cantons."

In 2012 Visanas subsidiary company Vivacare took over the basic insurance business of the Bernese insurance group Innova.

In 2019 Angelo Eggli, former managing director of Allianz Partners Schweiz, was elected as CEO and replaced Valeria Trachsel.
