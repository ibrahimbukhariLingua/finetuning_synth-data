Siam Commercial Bank


# Siam Commercial Bank



**Siam Commercial Bank** (Thai: ธนาคารไทยพาณิชย์; RTGS: *Thanakhan Thai Phanit*), officially the **Siam Commercial Bank Public Company Limited**, is the first Thai bank. It was founded on 30 January 1907 by the appointment of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V).


## History

SCB was founded as the **Book Club** on 4 October 1904 by Prince Jayanta Mongkol, a brother of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), who was convinced that the time was ripe for Siam to have its own banking system to help foster the country's economic development, rather than rely on foreign banks operating branches in the country. The name "Book Club" was chosen in an effort to keep the project sub rosa as it was something of an experiment. After the success of the Book Club, King Chulalongkorn granted royal approval for it to officially operate as a commercial bank under the name "Siam Commercial Bank" on 30 January 1907.

SCB opened its headquarters in Bangkok's Talat Noi District in 1910. In 1911, it was granted approval to display the royal Garuda symbol as a royal warrant by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI).

As of May 2024, Siam Commercial Bank has 643 domestic branches and over 10,000 ATMs around the country.
