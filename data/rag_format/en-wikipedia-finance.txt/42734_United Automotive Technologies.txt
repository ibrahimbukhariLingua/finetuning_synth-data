# United Automotive Technologies



**United Automotive Technologies** (Russian: Объединенные Автомобильные Технологии, romanized: *Ob"yedinennyye Avtomobil'nyye Tekhnologii*) also known by its Russian-language initialism **OAT**, is a Russia-based automotive industry holding owned by KAMAZ.


## History

United Automotive Technologies was established in 2008 by Rostec to consolidate the supply of domestic auto parts. By 2012, it took control of AvtoVAZ assets formerly belonging to the SOK Group. In 2015, AvtoVAZ tried to purchase United Automotive Technologies, but the deal fell through. In February 2018, Rostec sold United Automotive Technologies to KAMAZ (49%) and its subsidiary Remdiesel (51%). The Remdiesel stake was later transferred to Spetsavtokam.

In June 2019, the United Automotive Technologies group liquidated PKH Autocomponents, a debt-ridden, money-losing subsidiary holding that controlled group's assets in Dimitrovgrad and the Penza Oblast. The group took direct control of said assets.

In November 2021, AvtoVAZ said it again planned to acquire a stake in United Automotive Technologies. If the acquisition is completed, the holding will become a joint venture owned by KAMAZ (45%), AvtoVAZ (40%) and Spetsavtokam (15%).
