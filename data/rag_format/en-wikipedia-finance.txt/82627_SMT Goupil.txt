SMT Goupil


# SMT Goupil



**SMT Goupil** (SMT - "Society of Microcomputing and Telecommunications") was a French IT company created in 1979 by Claude Perdrillat, previously a senior executive in the General Directorate of Telecommunications.

The company produced many microcomputers during the 1980s, mainly for French government agencies. This market collapsed at the end of the 1980s with the appearance of drastic budgetary restrictions in the French public sector and competition from more aggressive technological rivals like IBM, Apple and Olivetti.

Despite a significant debt of 40 million francs, the company went public in 1985, claiming to hold 15% of the French microcomputer market.

In January 1990, Goupil claimed to hold 18% of the market for professional microcomputers in France.

The company filed for bankruptcy in June 1991 with the accounting books revealing a debt of 700 million francs and a real turnover of 830 million francs in 1990.


## Models

The first **Goupil G1** and **G2** computers offered a promising architecture, with the integration of the Motorola 6808 processor coupled with the FLEX operating system. The machines had a sober and integrated design with particular colors - slate blue and red.

The **G3** extended compatibility in order to conquer foreign markets, by offering two processors at a time (selected at start-up by a switch) among three choices: the very common Motorola 6809, Zilog Z80 and Intel 8088. This allowed the Flex 9 and UniFLEX operating systems that came with the machine to run under MS-DOS, CP/M and UCSD Pascal. The dark gray case, designed by designer Roger Tallon, came with an integrated 12-inch monochrome monitor, two floppy disk drives, and a bay for 7 extension cards in Goupil format.

Further machines would seek IBM PC compatibility, as it became a standard regarding government equipment.
