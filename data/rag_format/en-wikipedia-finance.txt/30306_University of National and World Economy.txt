## History


### Founding

UNWE was founded in 1920 as the **Free University of Political and Economic Sciences** (FUPES) by Stefan Bobchev and the Russian emigre Peter Bogaevsky with ordinance of the Minister of Public Education. In 1940 FUPES was transformed into the **State Higher Education School of Finance and Administrative Sciences** (SHESFA) and in 1947 SHESFA was transformed into a *Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences* at Sofia University.


### Communist period

During the communist period in Bulgaria, the university was called the Karl Marx Higher Institute of Economics, but was renamed on 27 April 1990, soon after end of the communist era, due to the perceived failure of communism and, particularly, Marxist economics.


### Modern period

After the democratic changes in Bulgaria, the Academic Board (AB) passed a resolution renaming the **Karl Marx Higher Institute of Economics** into the **University of National and World Economy** (On 27 April 1990 ). Officially this was done with an act of the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria on the establishment and transformation of higher educational institutions (26 July 1995).

Prof. Dimitar Panayotov Dimitrov is the current rector of the university, elected in December 2019.

The university was awarded the Japanese Foreign Minister’s Commendation for their contributions to promotion of economic relations and mutual understanding between Bulgaria and Japan on 1 December 2020.


## International Activity
