## Controversies


### Bribery allegations

In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of rig contracts signed by Sevan Drilling, a subsidiary of Seadrill, in 2005-2008. In 2018, Økokrim, the Norwegian authority for investigation and prosecution of economic and environmental crime, completed the investigation against Sevan Drilling and the original charges were dismissed.


### Environmental damage due to rig fire

In November 2009, Seadrill's West Atlas jackup rig, which was located on Montara field, about 690 kilometers offshore of Darwin, Australia, caught fire after the field had been leaking oil for ten weeks. The rig was operated by the Thai firm PTTEP. For 74 days, gas and oil ran into the Timor Sea, in what was one of the worst environmental disasters in Australian history.

The Thai national petroleum exploration company (PTTEP) took immediate responsibility for the oil spill and, in 2011, the company pleaded guilty to four charges in the Darwin Magistrates Court relating to the workplace health and safety and failure to maintain good oilfield practice. The company conducted scientific studies and concluded there “has been little or no detectable impact from the spill on any marine ecosystem or species in the Timor Sea”.
