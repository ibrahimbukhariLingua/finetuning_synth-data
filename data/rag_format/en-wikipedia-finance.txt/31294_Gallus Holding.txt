# Gallus Holding



**Gallus Holding AG**, based in St. Gallen, Switzerland, is an international manufacturer of label printing and folding carton presses. Since 2014, Gallus is a complete subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG.


## History

The sole proprietorship *Ferdinand Rüesch, Gauger (scales factory and machine workshop)* was founded in 1923 by Ferdinand Rüesch-Baur. The first label printing press was produced in 1925. The company moved into the export business in the mid-1950s, before launching a world first in 1960 with the introduction of the segment die-cutting unit.

Having built up a workforce of some 220 employees by 1974, the company was transformed into a joint stock company and now operated under the name *Gallus Ferd. Rüesch AG*.

The foundation of a first subsidiary in the United States in 1981 represented the company's first direct foray into international territory. This strategy was continued in the 1990s in particular through the acquisition of a holding in *Arsoma Druckmaschinen GmbH* in Langgöns, Germany, and the foundation of additional subsidiaries in Great Britain, Germany, Australia and Denmark between 1992 and 1996. In 1999, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG acquired a 30 percent share in the Gallus Group. A total acquisition was completed in 2014 after the Heidelberg management board agreed to do so.

In 2006, the Gallus Group acquired *BHS Druck- und Veredelungstechnik GmbH* in Weiden, Germany. The company's name was changed to *Gallus Stanz- und Druckmaschinen GmbH* in 2008, and it now makes up a second area of operation in the Gallus Group in the form of the *Folding Carton* division. In July 2020, Heidelberg announced the sale of Gallus to the Swiss Benpac Holding AG. The sale was canceled in January 2021.
