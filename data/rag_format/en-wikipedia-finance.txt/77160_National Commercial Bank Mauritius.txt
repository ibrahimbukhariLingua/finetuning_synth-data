# National Commercial Bank Mauritius



**National Commercial Bank Limited**, commonly known as **NCB**, was a financial institution based in Mauritius with its head office situated in Port Louis. It was one of the commercial banks licensed by the Bank of Mauritius, the country's central bank and the nation's banking regulator.


## History

**National Commercial Bank Limited** was incorporated on Thursday April 9, 2015 and issued a commercial banking license by the Bank of Mauritius on Friday April 10, 2015. National Commercial Bank acquired the assets and some liabilities of the now defunct Bramer Banking Corporation. This was after Bramer Banking Corporation's banking license was revoked by the Bank of Mauritius following a liquidity crisis at the bank. The transfer of bank accounts and operations of the former Bramer Banking Corporation to NCB was held on Saturday April 11, 2015.

On Monday January 4, 2016, NCB was merged into state-owned Mauritius Post and Cooperative Bank to form **Mauritius Bank** (**MauBank**). The newly formed bank received a banking licence on the same day.
