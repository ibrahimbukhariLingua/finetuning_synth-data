France Business School


# France Business School



**France Business School** (fBS) was a French Business School, founded in 2012 by a meanwhile cancelled merger of four French business schools:

* l'École supérieure de commerce et management (ESCEM) in Tours, Poitiers and Orléans
* l'École supérieure de commerce d'Amiens (ESC Amiens)
* l'École supérieure de commerce de Clermont (ESC Clermont)
* l'ESC Bretagne Brest

## History

fBS was created in a period of merger between French Business Schools in order to achieve "critical size" at an international level. It was officially announced on 22 May 2012. fBS was finally announced as the merger of 4 pre-existing schools: l'École supérieure de commerce et de management (ESCEM) in Tours-Poitiers-Orléans, l'École supérieure de commerce d'Amiens (ESC Amiens), l'École supérieure de commerce de Clermont (ESC Clermont), l'École supérieure de commerce Bretagne Brest (ESC Bretagne Brest).


## Type of recruitment

At its inception, fBS announced its withdrawal from the existing admission testing procedures (BCE, Ecricome) and introduced a different admission procedure from the traditional competitive entrance examination system by organising recruitment days called *Talent Days* in about 20 French cities.

This recruitment targets different profiles:

* Students in the 2nd year of the preparatory track
* Holders of a 2-year undergraduate degree or currently enrolled as a Bachelor student
* Students with a 3-year undergraduate degree
* Graduates from an administrative or management degree programme
* Foreign students, holders of a Bachelor's degree
* Atypical profiles (students with "non-linear" backgrounds)

## Location

Other sites have joined the campuses of the founding fBS schools (Amiens, Brest, Clermont-Ferrand, Orléans, Poitiers, Tours):

* an associated site: Vannes
* sites abroad: Beijing and Shanghai
