**Booker Software, Inc.** is a software company headquartered in New York City. Its products are cloud-based management systems for spas and salon stores.


## History

Booker is headquartered in New York City, with offices in Irvine, California, Scottsdale, Arizona, the United Kingdom, and Singapore. Booker was started in 2007 by Peter Ellis and Daniel Lizio-Katzen as SpaBooker, a division of SpaFinder. SpaBooker was its initial software product.

In October 2010, SpaBooker spun off to a separate company called GramercyOne. During this time, the company continued to add features to the SpaBooker platform and market it to other appointment-based service businesses such as hotels, medical practices, dance studios, and repair shops.

In November 2012, GramercyOne changed its name to Booker Software, Inc. As of March 2015, Booker has over 270 employees and is under the leadership of CEO Josh McCarter. In February 2017, Booker expanded its new 10,000-square-foot office at SkySong.


## Financials and operations

Booker has 9,000 business clients in 73 countries. Notable clients include Hilton Hotels, Hard Rock Café, and DryBar.

In November 2012, Booker reported triple-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive year. As of August 2013, Booker was processing $4.5 million in daily transactions and 2 million monthly appointment bookings on its platform.
