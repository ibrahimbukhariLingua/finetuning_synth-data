A **year-on-year inflation-indexed swap** (**YYIIS**) is a standard derivative product over inflation rate. The underlying is a single consumer price index (CPI).

It is called a swap because each year there is a swap of a fixed amount against a floating amount, although in practice only a one way payment is made (fixed amount – floating amount).


## Detailed flows

* Each year, at time {\displaystyle T\_{i}}
 + Party B pays Party A the fixed amount {\displaystyle N{\phi \_{i}}K}
 + Party A pays Party B the floating amount {\displaystyle N{\psi \_{i}}[{\frac {I(T\_{i})}{I(T\_{i-1})}}-1]}

where:

* **K** is the contract fixed rate
* **N** the contract nominal value
* **M** the number of years corresponding to the deal maturity
* **i** the number of years (0 < i <= M)
* **{\displaystyle \phi \_{i}}** is the fixed-leg year fractions for the interval [Ti−1, Ti]
* **{\displaystyle \psi \_{i}}** is the floating-leg year fractions for the interval [Ti−1, Ti]
* **{\displaystyle T\_{0}}** is the start date
* **{\displaystyle T\_{i}}** is the time of the flow i
* **{\displaystyle T\_{M}}** is the maturity date (end of the swap)
* **{\displaystyle I(T\_{0})}** is the inflation at start date (time {\displaystyle T\_{0}})
* **{\displaystyle I(T\_{i})}** is the inflation at time of the flow i (time {\displaystyle T\_{i}})
* **{\displaystyle I(T\_{M})}** is the inflation at maturity date (time {\displaystyle T\_{M}})
