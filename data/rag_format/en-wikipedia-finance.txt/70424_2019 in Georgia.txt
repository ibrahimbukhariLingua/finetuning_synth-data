The incident is sparked by a Russian parliamentarian speaking from the speaker's chair during an international Orthodox assembly.

Russia responds to the Georgian opposition protests by banning flights to Tbilisi and ordering Russian tourists to leave Georgia.

### July

* 18 July — The Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights rules there has been no breach in fair trial guarantees in an ownership dispute of the Rustavi 2, the most-watched Georgian television channel critical of the Georgian Dream government. The Court also discontinues its suspension of the Georgian Supreme Court's March 2017 decision which granted the ownership rights of Rustavi 2 TV, to its former co-owner, the government-friendly businessman Kibar Khalvashi. The channel's new owners dismiss CEO Nika Gvaramia, its leading journalists and producers in late August, leading to the departure of the team of the main news release and other employees in protest.

### August

### September

* 3–9 September — The South Ossetian regime closes all crossing points with the Georgian government-controlled territory, aggravating humanitarian situation in the region and placing some 2,500 ethnic Georgians remaining in the Akhalgori district at a particular risk.

* 31 October — Internal dissension within the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) explodes into a scandal, when the Holy Synod of the GOC dismisses the influential bishop Petre Tsaava of Chqondidi for insulting the Catholicos Patriarch Ilia II and the Holy Synod.

### November

* 14 November — With 101 votes in favor, 3 against and 37 abstentions, the Parliament of Georgia votes down the constitutional amendment envisaging transition to fully proportional electoral system in 2020. With all of 44 votes from the opposition parties supporting the amendment, the rejection of the bill is seen as a renege on the earlier promise made by the ruling Georgian Dream party, leading to defection of several leading members from the Georgian Dream majority, reigniting street protests joined by all principal opposition parties and civic society organizations, and drawing criticism from Georgia's principal international partners. Several rounds of fruitless talks between the ruling party and opposition mediated by the Western diplomats take place as street protests continue and occasionally turn violent as the riot police is deployed to prevent the protests from picketing the parliament premises.
* 26 November — President Salome Zourabichvili signs a decree on the new rule of inmate pardoning developed through the consultations with the Parliament and the government. The move follows a period of Zourabichvili's self-imposed "moratorium" after several controversial August 2019 pardons criticized by the ruling party as well as the opposition and civic society.

### December

* 11 December — A 15-year-old teenager boy jumps from a high-rise, a day after he was detained and interrogated by the police for several hours because of graffiti on a school in Tbilisi.

* 12 December — The Parliament of Georgia approves 14 Supreme Court judges for the lifetime tenure in a vote boycotted by the opposition parties, including the United National Movement (UNM), European Georgia and former ruling party lawmakers.

The shortcoming were also noted by the U.S. and the Council of Europe.
* 20 December — Facebook removes hundreds of accounts, pages, and groups linked to the ruling Georgian Dream party for "coordinated inauthentic behavior", focused on pro-government propaganda and criticism of the opposition, and local activist organizations.
