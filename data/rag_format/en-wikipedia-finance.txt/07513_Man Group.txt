## History

The company was founded by James Man in 1783 as a sugar cooperage and brokerage, based in Harp Lane in Billingsgate. The following year Man Group won the contract to supply the Royal Navy with rum for its daily rum ration, a tradition under which all sailors were allocated a daily rum ration. This tradition continued until 1970, with Man Group holding the contract throughout. The company expanded from sugar and rum into other commodities such as coffee and cocoa. The company traded as a commodities business throughout the 19th and 20th century, gradually diversifying into financial services following the advent of financial exchanges to hedge commodity exposures.

The firm was renamed ED&F Man in 1869, based on the initials of James Man's grandsons Edward Desborough Man and Fredrick Man. ED&F Man listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994. In 2000 the company divided into two separate businesses, with Man Group plc focusing on financial services and ED&F Man (the commodities division) taken private in a management buy-out.

In 2007 Man Group transitioned to an investment management business, following the demerger and flotation of its brokerage business (known as MF Global) on the New York Stock Exchange. Man Group attained its current structure through acquisitions. Man AHL, founded by Cyril Adam, David Harding, and Martin Leuck, was acquired from 1989 to 1994. Man Group's other investment managers were formed via acquisition between 2010 and 2017, beginning with the 2010 acquisition of Man GLG (previously GLG Partners) for $1.6 billion, followed by Man FRM in 2012, Man Numeric in 2014, Man GPM in 2017 and Man Varagon (previously Varagon Capital Partners) in 2023.

In late 2017, Man Group announced the creation of a quantitative hedge fund in China. The firm has held licenses to operate in the country since 2012, but was provided clearance to operate as a private securities investment fund manager. Man is one of the first systematic investment managers to receive this accreditation. The fund was to be managed by Man's AHL division. In 2020, Man AHL received approval for a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor ("QFII") license in China.


## Operations

Man Group employs over 675 staff, offers over 85 investment strategies across a variety of investment approaches, styles and asset classes, and trades in over 825 markets around the world.
