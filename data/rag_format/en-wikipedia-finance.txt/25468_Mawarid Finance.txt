Mawarid Finance


# Mawarid Finance



**Mawarid Finance** is a private joint stock company in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, providing Shari'a-compliant financial services. It was founded in 2006 with a paid-up capital of AED 1 billion. All of its products are based on Islamic financial principles such as Ijarah, Istisnaa, Murabaha, Mudharaba, Musharaka, Kafalah and Wakala and its practices are governed by a full Sharia board.


## Operation

It is the only finance company in the UAE that is completely independent. In an effort to give itself operational freedom, its shares are distributed across more than 350 shareholders, with companies or organisations owning not more than 5% each of the capital and no individual shareholder's stake exceeding 2.5%

The company markets itself with the tagline *Falak Tayyeb* (in Arabic) which in English roughly translates as 'Consider it done'. This is intended to show its commitment to fast and personalized service.

Mawarid's primary goal has been to support and participate in the development of the UAE economy by:

* Supporting small and medium businesses (SMEs) which comprise 85% of the companies registered in the UAE. To this end, it operates the *Falak Tayyeb for SMEs* campaign.
* Encouraging UAE Nationals to participate in the nation's development through a policy of Emiratisation. Emiratis comprise more than 30% of Mawarid's workforce and their percentage rises to more than 70% in executive positions. This is in contrast to the 0.34% average in UAE's private sector.

## Campaigns

A product called eMurabaha was launched in 2008 which allows a customer to request, follow up and manage funding online through a fund management system following the Islamic mode of Murabaha. In 2011, this product won the 'Idea of the Year' award at the Ideas.Arabia 6th International Conference.

Apart from its *Falak Tayyeb* campaign which is the only local phrase to be used as a brand tagline in the region, it uses the Origami art form in its product branding. This serves "as a visual metaphor for not only the precision and intricate care that the company has taken with its customised products but also the blank page that Mawarid Finance shares with its customers before building their future".
