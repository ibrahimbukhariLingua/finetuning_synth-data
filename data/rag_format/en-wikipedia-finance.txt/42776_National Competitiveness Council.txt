National Competitiveness Council


# National Competitiveness Council



The **National Competitiveness Council** (NCC; Irish: *Comhairle Náisiúnta Iomaíochais*) is an independent policy advisory body in Ireland. It reports to the Taoiseach on key competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy together with recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland's competitive position. It was established by the Irish Government in May 1997 as part of the Partnership 2000 Social Partnership agreement. The Strategic Policy Division of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment provides the council with research and secretariat support.


## Structure

Council Members are appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and include representatives of the employer and trade union movements, including Irish Business and Employers Confederation and Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The composition of the council also includes persons with relevant expertise in competitiveness. A representative of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, typically the Assistant Secretary-General responsible for national competitiveness, is automatically appointed a member, under the terms of reference of the council.

Representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Environment, Climate and Communications, Education, Public Expenditure and Reform, Transport and Tourism and Sport and from InterTradeIreland attend Council meetings in an advisory capacity. The NCC meets four or five times each year.
