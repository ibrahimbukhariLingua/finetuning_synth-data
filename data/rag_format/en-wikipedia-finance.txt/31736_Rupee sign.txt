Rupee sign


# Rupee sign



The rupee sign "**₨**" is a currency sign used to represent the monetary unit of account in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mauritius, Seychelles, and formerly in India. It resembles, and is often written as, the Latin character sequence "Rs", of which (as a single character) it is an orthographic ligature.

It is common to find a punctuation mark between the rupee symbol and the digits denoting the amount, for example "Re: 1" (for one unit), or "Rs. 140" (for more than one rupee).

On 15 July 2010, India introduced a new currency symbol, the Indian rupee sign, ₹. This sign is a combination of the Devanagari letter र (*ra*) and the Latin capital letter R without its vertical bar (similar to the R rotunda).

| North Indic (pre-decimalisation) | U+A838 ꠸ NORTH INDIC RUPEE MARK A rupee was divided into 16 anas (sing. *ānā*, pl. *āne* in Hindi), and an ana into 12 pies (Hindi *pāī*). Fractions were written with vertical marks for quarters and horizontal marks for sixteenths (or, in the case of pies, twelfths). Rupees were written in normal digits, anas as fractions, and pies either as fractions or in a hybrid digit-fraction notation. The rupee mark was placed after the rupees and anas and before the pies. For example, in English, 4 rupees 6 anas and 8 pies would be written "Rs. 4-6-8". (Note the three-part notation is similar to *£pounds,shillings/pence* in pre-decimal British currency.) The same quantity in Devanagari was written ४꠰꠴꠸꠱꠴ (4+1⁄42⁄16R2⁄42⁄12, the ४=4 here is Devanagari, the other symbols were all used across multiple northern scripts). There were intermediate quarter-ana (and in Marharashtra, quarter-rupee) currency units, so this could also be read "4 *rupāyā* 1 *pavalī* 2 *ānā* 2 *paisā* 2 *pāī*". 40 rupees would be just ४०꠸, without any fractional part. | 5.2 |
