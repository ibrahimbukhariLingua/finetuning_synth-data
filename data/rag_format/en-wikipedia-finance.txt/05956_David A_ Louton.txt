# David A. Louton



**David Albert Louton** (born July 10, 1960) is an American investment strategy analyst. He is a professor of finance at Bryant University specialising in portfolio management, and has contributed to several influential news outlets.


## Early life and education

Louton was born into an American missionary family in Cape Town, Union of South Africa in 1960. He is the oldest of four children of Edgar Louton and Barbara Ann Hughes (b. 1937) and has three sisters. His paternal grandparents A. G. Louton and Louise Rettinger (1904 - 1967) went to South Africa as missionaries in 1951. His maternal grandfather, Ralph Hughes, was a well-known pastor from Clio, Michigan. Louton is a first cousin of theology professor Rollin G. Grams. Through his maternal grandmother, he is a great-great-grandson of Lewis Henry Coville.

Louton was an avid equestrian in his youth and earned a B.S., an MBA and a PhD from Michigan State University, graduating in 1990. He began commenting of finance in local newspapers while in college and initially considered becoming a stockbroker.


## Career

Following graduation, Louton was offered a position at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island. He joined the faculty in 1991 and since the beginning of his career has become one of the best-known analysts from the university.

From 2011 to 2013, he served as the Associate Dean of Bryant’s College of Business. From 2005 to 2015, he was an advisor of the Archway Investment Fund at Bryant.

During his career, he has taken on the role of a financial commentator. He has made notable contributions to Forbes, and The Hill and been cited in The Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Yahoo Finance, among other publications.

Louton has also written papers analyzing investments, for which he has won awards. These include best paper awards from the Southwestern Finance Association in 1994, the Academy of Financial services in 1998 and 2008, and the Market Technicians Association in 2013.

According to university tax filings found by ProPublica, Louton received base compensation of over US$217,000 in 2015 (equivalent to $278,935 in 2023) and additional compensation of over US$67,000 (equivalent to $86,123 in 2023), equating to a total salary of over US$284,000 (equivalent to $365,057 in 2023), for his role as a tenured finance professor. As one of the highest academic salaries in the United States, this forms part of a broader controversial trend at the university, with its former president, Ronald Machtley, an associate of Louton, making over $6 million as the country's highest-paid university president, according to Business Insider.

He is a member of several professional organisations, including the Providence chapter of the CFA Institute and the Market Technicians Association


## Personal life

Louton married Marcy McClard in 1979 in Flint, Michigan. Together, they have three children, Shaina Leigh Louton (b. 1980), Daniel David Louton (b. 1982), and Corrie Anne Louton (b. 1990).
