## Controversy

In 2011, it was reported that equipment sold by Allot has illegally reached Iran. However, in January 2012 Allot was cleared by the Israeli Ministry of Defense of any wrongdoing, as the investigation concluded that the company was unaware that the internet monitoring equipment it sold to the Danish distributor ended up in Iranian hands.
