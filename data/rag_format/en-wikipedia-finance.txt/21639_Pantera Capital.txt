# Pantera Capital



**Pantera Capital** is an American hedge fund and venture capital firm focused on digital assets headquartered in Menlo Park, California. The fund specializes in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It is one of the largest digital asset funds in the world by managed assets.


## History

The firm was founded in San Francisco, California in 2003 by Dan Morehead, before opening offices on Silicon Valley's Sand Hill Road. The fund was initially focused on global macro before moving into digital assets with Joey Krug, the founder of the first major Ethereum project, Augur. Morehead previously led global macro trading at Tiger Management and is seen as one of the fund's "tiger cubs".

The company invested money in the fraudulent cryptocurrency firm FTX and was hit hard by its collapse in November 2022.


## Funding

In 2013, Pantera launched the first investment fund focused on Bitcoin in the United States. The fund opened an office in New York during the early 2000s and established operations in Puerto Rico in 2021.

Pantera launched its second blockchain fund in 2022, seeking to raise $1.25 billion. The company’s first blockchain fund was launched in June 2021.

The company launched its third venture fund in 2018 and raised $100 million.
