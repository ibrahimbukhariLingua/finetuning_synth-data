Far East Global Group


# Far East Global Group



**Far East Global Group** was first established in 1969 in Hong Kong as a small workshop and the business was incorporated in 1977 as Far East Aluminium Works Company Limited. Through years of growth and expansion, the workshop has been transformed from a small aluminium windows contractor into a multi-national enterprise. In 1991, the then newly incorporated holding company, Far East Aluminium (Holdings) Limited (“FEAHL”), successfully went public and became a listed company in Hong Kong.

Internationally, Far East Global Group has been hired as the key exterior facade contractor in various countries including, United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, Chile, Singapore, Macau and mainland China.

In April 2008, Far East Aluminum has officially been renamed as Far East Group Limited.

In December 2009, Far East Group Limited officially changed its name to Far East Global Group Limited.
