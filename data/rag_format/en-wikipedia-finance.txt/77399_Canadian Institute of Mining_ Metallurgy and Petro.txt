# Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum



The **Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum** (CIM) is a not-for-profit technical society of professionals in the Canadian minerals, metals, materials and energy industries. CIM's members are convened from industry, academia and government.


## History

In March 1898, the Canadian Mining Institute was founded in Montreal at the second annual meeting of the Federated Canadian Mining Institute, which was dissolved. The Institute was incorporated by an Act of Parliament to include all former provincial groups except The Mining Society of Nova Scotia, which remained a separate body.

In 1902, The Institute formed its first Branches in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Kingston, Ontario, and Nelson, British Columbia. In 1918, the Mining Society of Nova Scotia formally became affiliated with the Canadian Mining Institute.

In 1920, Metallurgy was added to the name to recognize the inclusion of this discipline.

In 1942, the Institute made CIM its official abbreviation.

In 1990, "Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum" became the official name of the Institute by an Act of Parliament.

In 1996, CIM published its Guidelines for the Estimation, Classification and Reporting of Resources and Reserves. This document became an integral part of National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), the set of rules for reporting and displaying information from mineral properties owned by companies listed on Canadian exchanges that came into effect on Feb. 1, 2001.

1998 was CIM's Centennial Year. A book entitled "Pride and Vision" by E. Tina Crossfield was published in commemoration of the event.

In 2018, CIM celebrated its 120th anniversary. It also launched a completely redesigned site for all of its Standards, Best Practices & Guidance for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves materials, including the 2014 update of CIM Definition Standards.

In 2023, CIM celebrated its 125th anniversary.

In 2024, CIM changed its logo.
