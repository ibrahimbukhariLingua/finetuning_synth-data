Green company


# Green company



A **green company**, also known as an environmentally friendly or sustainable business, is an organization that conducts itself in a way that minimizes harm to the environment. Examples of these actions may include the conservation of natural resources, efforts to reduce carbon emissions, a reduction of waste creation, and support of ecological conservation. Green companies often implement environmentally responsible practices across their entire value chain, from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing processes and distribution.

Green companies aim to contribute to the preservation of the environment and address the challenges posed by climate change. This commitment to environmental stewardship is increasingly important in the context of growing concerns about global warming and the broader environmental impact of human activities.

Green companies and businesses that partake in sustainable practices often receive criticism and face scrutiny for being accused of greenwashing and manipulative marketing. The use of what "green" methods and practices are is often hyperbolized when utilized in advertising, and has led to controversy across industries on whether a practice, product, initiative, or other action is one that is sustainable enough to constitute being green.


## Characteristics

Green companies have traits that are common among sustainable businesses.

Some of the notable practices of a green company are:

* An emphasis on their sustainable and environmentally conscious practices.
* Support of conservation and environmental protection.
* Use of renewable methods in their business, ranging from energy to packaging.
* Community engagement in local environmental and social issues.
* A commitment to reduction of energy and material consumption.
* Use of alternative, multi-use materials.

A common theme amongst green companies is green marketing. Green companies will utilize this form of advertising to draw in consumers who care about environmental practices. This strategy is used outside of green companies, often being labeled as greenwashing. The line between these practices can at times be thin, and green companies have had controversies on the use of greenwashing, and the efficacy of their sustainability.


## Controversy

Supporters of green companies claim that it is far more economical to go green than it is to continue adding harmful chemicals to the atmosphere and the environment in general. Companies that have attempted to become green businesses have often faced significant scrutiny and backlash.

In 2013, The Coca-Cola Company was accused of greenwashing, after marketing a new line of plastic bottles. These ads utilized natural colors and scenes, with a Coca-Cola bottle emerging from leaves in place of a flower. It is alleged that these ads used natural themes to subtly imply a more environmentally conscious packaging. However, said bottles were the same as before.

In 2015, the car company Volkswagen, VW, was caught in a large scandal, dubbed by the public as *Dieselgate*. As an effort to enter American car markets, Volkswagen marketed their new diesel vehicles as "sustainable" through their "Think Blue" campaign. This advertising campaign pitched their diesel technology as, "...being more responsible on the road and more environmentally conscious...". Despite presale testing supporting these claims, independent studies found this to be opposite of the truth. VW had installed "defeat devices" in their diesel vehicles, which were used to cheat emissions tests. These devices were used during emissions testing, and worked by feigning the actual amount emissions in order to pass the test. During normal driving conditions, the emissions were much higher, up to 40 times higher, than allowed by environmental regulations through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This scandal resulted in significant environmental and financial repercussions for the auto company. It led to large recalls of their vehicles, legal battles, and billions of dollars in settlements and financial compensation. The company's reputation was severely damaged, and several high-level executives resigned as a result.
