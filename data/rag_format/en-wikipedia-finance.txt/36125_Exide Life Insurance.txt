## History

In 2000, ING Insurance, a subsidiary of the Dutch financial group ING Group, partnered with Bangalore-based Vysya Bank to enter the Indian life insurance market, forming ING Vysya Life Insurance Company. The same year, ING Vysya Bank, ING Insurance, and the Damani Group established a life insurance joint venture, marking the first bancassurance venture in India.

In 2005, Exide Industries acquired a 50% stake in ING Vysya Life Insurance. The company distributed its products through various channels, including Agency, Bancassurance, Corporate Agency & Broking, Direct Channel, and Online.

Following the Financial crisis of 2007â€“08, ING entered a global restructuring strategy and decided to exit the insurance business in India. Prior to its exit from India, ING had also exited insurance ventures in Malaysia, Thailand, and Hong Kong.


### Exide Life Insurance

After ING's exit from India in January 2013, Exide Industries acquired the remaining 50% stake in ING Vysya Life Insurance, becoming the sole owner. In May 2014, following approvals from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the company was renamed Exide Life Insurance Company Limited (Exide Life Insurance). The company had a presence in over 200 cities across India and planned to expand operations to additional centres, including major cities such as Kolkata, Asansol, Jorhat, and states like Bihar and Odisha.
