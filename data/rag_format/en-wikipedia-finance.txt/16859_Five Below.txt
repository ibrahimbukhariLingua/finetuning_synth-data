# Five Below



**Five Below, Inc.** is an American chain of specialty discount stores that prices most of its products at $5 or less, plus a smaller assortment of products priced up to $25. Founded in 2002 by Tom Vellios and David Schlessinger and headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the chain is aimed at tweens and teens. There are over 1,700 stores located across the United States.


## History

David Schlessinger, founder of Encore Books and Zany Brainy, and Tom Vellios, former CEO of Zany Brainy, founded Five Below on October 4, 2002 in Wayne, Pennsylvania.

On March 18, 2020, Five Below announced the temporary closing of all stores due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, as of May 29, 2020, 75% of Five Below stores across the United States reopened with plans for new stores to open up.


## Growth and expansion

As of the 2020s, Five Below operates over 1,700 stores in 44 states, employing over 25,000 associates along with five distribution centers. It began its outward expansion away from the Philadelphia Metro area by entering additional out-of-state markets: Illinois and Michigan in 2011; Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, and Western Michigan in 2012; Texas in 2013; Tennessee in 2014; Alabama, Florida, and Kentucky in 2015; Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin in 2016; California in 2017; and Arkansas in 2018. Five Below in 2019 publicly stated that they could build as many as 2,500 U.S. stores in the future. Arizona, Iowa, and Nebraska were introduced that year. Colorado and Nevada were added in 2020; New Mexico and Utah in 2021. Both Dakotas had opened new stores in 2022. Vermont joined in the next year. Oregon and Washington are to open later.

In September 2014, the company announced a new lease agreement to move its New Castle, Delaware, distribution center to Oldmans Township, New Jersey. The new center would add 275 jobs to the local economy while Delaware would lose 175.

On July 19, 2012, Five Below went public on the NASDAQ at the share price of $17. In 2014, Joel Anderson was appointed CEO. 2016 sales were $1 billion, 2017 sales were $1.3 billion, and 2022 sales reached $3.08 billion.

On July 16, 2024, Five Below announced Joel Anderson had resigned from his roles as president and CEO to pursue other interests. Following his departure, Five Below's shares fell by 25%. On the same day Petco named him as their new CEO. Chief Operating Officer, Kenneth Bull, was appointed interim president and CEO of Five Below.


## Store format

The average Five Below store size is 8,000 square feet (740 m²). The store specializes mainly in carrying a wide variety of merchandise at a low price.
