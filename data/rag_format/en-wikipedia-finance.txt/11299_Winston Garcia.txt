## As general manager and president of GSIS

Garcia overhauled the near-bankrupt GSIS into the most profitable government enterprise in the Philippines.

He intensified collection, eliminated fraud, launched aggressive marketing of new products and services to members, and instituted practical reforms in GSIS investment activities. He also purged entries of deceased members from the GSIS rolls.


### GSIS assets increased by 500 billion pesos (US$10 billion) during his 9-year tenure

When GSIS was on the cusp of bankruptcy, Garcia employed several technological and managerial reforms which saved the corporation. In the span of 9 years, Garcia was able to generate nearly 500 billion pesos (US$10 billion) for the GSIS conglomerate.


### GSIS e-Card and G-V@PS

Garcia delivered the 1.5 million GSIS members into the Digital Age by embarking on the ambitious eCard Plus System, the GSIS Wireless Automated Processing System (G-W@PS) and the GSIS Voice Activated Processing System (G-V@PS). These programs enabled GSIS members to enjoy their GSIS benefits and loan privileges anytime and anywhere—using automated, paperless, secure, and wireless systems.


### Juan Luna's "The Parisian Life"

One of the most controversial paintings to date is Juan Luna's "The Parisian Life" which is now exhibited to the public at the Philippine National Museum.

An oil painting dated 1892, the painting was purchased in 2002 Garcia at an auction in Hong Kong for Php 46 million, which raised questions over whether government workers' money was being properly used.

The Commission on Audit (COA) filed a case against Garcia for graft and grave misconduct. Garcia's decision to purchase a piece of history was proven to be a worthy investment for the agency after COA decided to reconsider its disallowance of the purchase of the painting.

The painting, which was purchased initially at Php 46 million, is now worth Php 300 Million. The investment proved worthy.

## Political life

Garcia served in the Provincial Board of Cebu for two terms, from April 1986 to June 1995. As provincial board member, he is credited for developing the P1 billion bond program of Cebu that raised funds to finance the province's infrastructure, triggering the Ce-boom phenomenon.

A lawyer by profession, he was the gubernatorial candidate of One Cebu Party for the 2016 Cebu elections. Nerissa Soon Ruiz was his running mate for Vice Governor in the May 9 election against the incumbent Cebu Governor Hilario Davide III and Vice Governor Agnes Magpale of Liberal Party (Philippines).

On February 16, 2016, Binay's party United Nationalist Alliance and One Cebu party (with former GSIS chairman Garcia as the party's gubernatorial bet in Cebu local elections, 2016) form a local coalition in the province of Cebu during the local party's general assembly.

Garcia had openly challenged incumbent Cebu governor Davide to a public debate, but Davide refused, commenting that it was "a waste of time.". On his side, Winston Garcia urges COMELEC to organize local debate. "A debate is a venue for voters to learn about a candidates platform. It will help guide them in identifying which leader has the better program," Garcia said.
