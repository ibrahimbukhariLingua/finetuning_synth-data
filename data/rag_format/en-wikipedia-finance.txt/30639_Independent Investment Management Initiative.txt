Independent Investment Management Initiative


# Independent Investment Management Initiative



**Independent Investment Management Initiative** (**IIMI**), formerly known as the **New City Initiative**, is a British think tank that offers an independent, expert voice in the debate over the future of financial regulation for investment firms.

The IIMI aims to raise awareness of the contribution made by small entrepreneurial firms make to the economy and society as a whole. It publishes quarterly papers and contributes evidence to relevant political and regulatory commissions. It has for example argued that the bonus cap for bankers should only apply to banks that were bailed out by taxpayers and should not apply to independent fund managers.


## History

Founded in 2010, IIMI counts amongst its members some of the leading independent asset management firms in the City and the continent. The IIMI gives a voice to independent, owner-managed firms that are entirely focused on and aligned with the interests of their clients and investors.

Since 2010, an old fashioned “client-centric” approach has enabled entrepreneurial firms in the Square Mile and beyond to emerge as a growing force in a financial industry dominated by global financial giants. These firms play a key role in preserving the stability and long-term focus of the financial sector, which is of benefit to society at large.
