ISTAO


# ISTAO



The **Istituto Adriano Olivetti di studi per la gestione dell'economia e delle aziende**, known as **ISTAO** is a business school in Ancona, established in 1967 by the Italian economist Giorgio Fuà. ISTAO organizes post-graduate and executive courses as well as it gives its contribution in the field of Economy and Finance. ISTAO is named upon the name of Adriano Olivetti, the well-known entrepreneur who created and managed the Olivetti company and worked with Fuà during the '40s. ISTAO has been established in 1967 within the new Faculty of Economics of Ancona whereas a group of people, led by Giorgio Fuà, started to gain interest in finding new methodologies and techniques in teaching and research fields. According to this proposition, ISTAO developed during the years a methodology that makes it completely different from the Italian academic system and nowadays the business school is characterized by its tight link with the regional economic network (The "productive model") and by the managerial style of its teaching.


## History

Since the very first period of activity of the school, Fuà and his colleagues underlined the need of a professional preparation over the academic one.
During the '70s the base of the society is widened through the opening to the '’ founder members'’, the institutions and companies willing to contribute to the financial funding of the Institute, aside of the '’ordinary members'’ category, responsible of ensuring the scientific validity of School's initiatives. This structure is still on nowadays and it allowed ISTAO to host precious contributions in research and teaching activities by Italian and international professionals and experts.
In 1997 Fuà ceases the role of President (remaining as Honorary President until the death in 2000). First President after Fuà is Sabino Cassese, then Paolo Pettenati from 2000 to 2008, supported by vice-President Valeriano Balloni since 2004. The three-year period from 2008 to 2011 is represented by Adolfo Guzzini, one of the outstanding figure of Marche industry network, supported once more by Valeriano Balloni.
Starting from the academic year 2011–2012, the President is Andrea Merloni, President of Indesit, supported by Professor Gianluca Gregori, dean of the Faculty of Economics at Polytechnic University of the Marches.


## Main courses

Main post-graduate course taught at ISTAO is focused on strategy and management and it has been delivered every year for more than 40 years.
Alongside it, other postgraduate courses are organized, including International management and Finance for business.
