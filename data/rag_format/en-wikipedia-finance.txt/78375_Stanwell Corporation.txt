Stanwell Corporation


# Stanwell Corporation



**Stanwell Corporation** is a Queensland Government-owned corporation. Stanwell is the state's largest electricity generator and Australiaâ€™s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter.

Stanwell owns and operates a portfolio of electricity generation assets in Queensland including two of the youngest and most energy efficient coal-fired power stations in Australia, being Stanwell Power Station in Rockhampton and Tarong North Power Station in the South Burnett region.

The company employs approximately 800 people across various sites in Queensland. The two government ministers responsible for Stanwell Corporation are the Treasurer of Queensland and the Minister for Energy and Clean Economy Jobs.


## Major assets

Major assets owned and operated by Stanwell include

* Stanwell Power Station

On 31 October 2019, ownership of Stanwell's low and no emission power stations was transferred to CleanCo Queensland. This includes the gas-fired Swanbank E Power Station and the three Far North Queensland hydro facilities (Kareeya, Barron Gorge and Koombooloomba). Windy Hill Wind Farm in Queensland and Toora Wind Farm in Victoria were owned by Stanwell but were sold to Transfield Services in 2007. The company also subsequently sold Emu Downs Wind Farm in Western Australia.

Following a review by the Treasurer of Queensland of the state's electricity sector in 2010, Tarong Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Stanwell Corporation on 1 July 2011.

The Mackay Gas Turbine was decommissioned in April 2021 and no longer supplies grid power to the National Electricity Market (NEM).


## History

In 2016, The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection began an investigation into the tailings disposal company used by Stanwell.


## Management

In 2016, management at Stanwell was criticised for receiving bonuses when a company they charged with tailings disposal for their assets had not paid its debts.

In 2021, the Chairman of the board of Directors was Paul Binstead. Richard van Breda resigned from the CEO position in 2021.
