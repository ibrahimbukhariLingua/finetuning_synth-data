*Young Money: Rise of an Empire* was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 8 reviews, indicating "generally mixed reviews". Melanie Sims of the Associated Press said, "Lil Wayne isn't just the founder of Young Money Cash Money Billionaires, he's the rap squad's captain, too. And on "*Rise of an Empire*," Weezy plays his role well, anchoring a winning compilation from the camp, and making up for last year's lackluster *I Am Not a Human Being II*." In closing she said "though Wayne, Drake and Minaj are the star players, their bench-warmers keep it hot." David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, "Call it a wobbly when it comes to quality, or a showcase for the young that's stolen by the old, but it's best to consider it a simple roster-promoting label compilation that just happens to come with an EP or so worth of fire." Sheldon Pearce of *XXL* said, "*Rise Of An Empire* is muddled by mid-level talent. The stars shine brightly but their presence is spotty at best. The rest of the roster just doesn't produce in their absence. While We Are Young Money was a semblance of roughly disjointed but mildly enjoyable posse cuts loaded with artists willing to just make their presence felt, *Rise Of An Empire* feels almost entirely like an album pitching stand-ins as the next wave of world conquering MCs to no avail." However, he praised Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj's appearances and the Lil Twist, Tyga and YG collaboration "One Time".

Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 4.9 out of 10, saying "A DVD released along with the deluxe edition of Nicki Minaj's last album pictures her alongside Wayne, presenting him with a brand new car for his birthday and faithfully referring to him as the President. She and Drake clearly remember the days when they were lucky to have Young Money. *Rise of an Empire* paints a different picture, one that emphasizes exactly how lucky Young Money is to still have them." Mike Powell of *Rolling Stone* gave the album two and a half stars out of five, saying "Contractually, Drake and Minaj are here; artistically, they've moved on. And the label's flagship genius, Lil Wayne, is ostentatiously bored: "Have my cake and eat it, too/I want a bakery." That's so half-ass, it's almost funny." Jordan Sowunmi of *Now* gave the album two out of five stars, saying "The album is bogged down in missteps like Tyga, Lil' Twist and YG's limp One Time and uninspired strip club anthem Back It Up. Wayne, who's been on autopilot the last few years, is spotty again here, delivering a characteristically apathetic verse on the Christina Millian co-starring Video Model, sounding like a man trying to capture the flirty magic of his earlier pop features, but falling painfully short."

*Complex* named it the twenty-sixth best album of the first half of 2014. Writing for them, Lauren Nostro said, "Intro posse cut "We Alright" bangs, as does "Trophies" and "Lookin Ass." Add strong YG and Meek Mill features, plus a tremendous effort from Wayne on "Moment," and you've got an unlikely success"
