## History

Danzas was founded in 1815 and was originally based in Saint-Louis, Alsace, France.

Louis Danzas fought at Waterloo for Napoleon. After that battle, he joined a transport company owned by Michel l'Eveque and by 1840 became joint owner. The company, Danzas, and l'Eveque, obtained a mail delivery franchise from Le Havre to New York City in 1846. A Basel branch was opened in 1854.

The company began to use air transport in 1920 between France, and England, and opened its own freight terminal in Paris in 1962.

In 2000, Deutsche Post World Net acquired Danzas. When Deutsche Post AG acquired 100% of DHL in 2002, it fully integrated Danzas, DHL and EuroExpress under the DHL brand, thus renaming Danzas to DHL Danzas Air & Ocean.

In 2005, Deutsche Post dropped the Danzas brand and renamed the business unit DHL Global Forwarding/DHL Freight.

In 2006, it also combined parts of Danzas and other ground-based freight subsidiaries in its Global Forwarding, Freight division.
