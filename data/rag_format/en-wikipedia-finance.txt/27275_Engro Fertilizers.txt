**Engro Fertilizers** (Urdu pronunciation: [ɛn.ˈɡɾoː ˈfɝː.tɪ.laɪ.zɚrz] en-GROW-FER-ti-LY-zurz) is a Pakistani fertiliser manufacturing company headquartered in Karachi with its manufacturing facility located at Daharki, and a facility located at Port Qasim as well. It is a subsidiary of Engro Corporation. It has 35% market share of the Pakistani fertilizer market as of 2023.


## History

Engro Fertilizers was demerged from the parent company Engro Corporation in 2010.

In June 2011, Engro commissioned the EnVen plant at a cost of $1.1 billion. It was built under the 2001 Fertilizer Policy of Pakistan in which the Government of Pakistan guaranteed gas supply at a reduced rate for ten years. The contract was signed with Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, which defaulted on their contract and in 2013 Engro claimed Rs. 34 billion in damages.

In December 2013, Engro was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange, following an initial public offering at a strike price of Rs. 28.25.

In February 2015, Engro Fertilizers acquired Engro Eximp Private Limited from Engro Corporation. Engro Eximp imports diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer in Pakistan.

In June 2016, Engro Corporation sold 28 percent of its stake in Engro Fertilizers to private investors for $185 million.
