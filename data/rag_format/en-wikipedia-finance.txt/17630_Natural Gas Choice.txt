Natural Gas Choice


# Natural Gas Choice



**Natural Gas Choice** programs in United States of America allow residential consumers and other small volume gas users to purchase natural gas from someone other than their traditional utility company. With Natural Gas Choice programs, customers can either purchase from their natural gas utility or choose to receive their gas supply from non-utility suppliers. Large commercial and industrial consumers have had the option of purchasing the natural gas commodity separately from natural gas services for many years.
