## Etymology

Somajiguda is named after Sonaji Pandit, a Daftardar (revenue officer) in the estate of Raja Rai Rayan, a nobleman of Hyderabad in 1853. A mansion was built by the then Raja of the Rai Rayan estate during the rule of Nasir-ud-Daulah for Sonaji Pandit to honour his service. Sonaji Pandit resided in this mansion in his entire life. Over time Sonaji-Guda (*Guda* meaning place in the local dialect of Telugu) became Somajiguda.
