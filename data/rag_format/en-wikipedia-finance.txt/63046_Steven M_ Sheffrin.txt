## Research and publications

Sheffrin’s research focuses on public finance, taxation and behavioral economics, exploring the practical, policy-oriented questions related to property taxation, state corporate taxation, tax fairness and compliance. "He is the author of ten books and monographs and over one hundred articles in the fields of macroeconomics, public finance, and international economics. His book *Rational Expectations* (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1996) is a highly regarded introduction to this important theory." He has written extensively on California Proposition 13 and was Director of the Proposition 13 Study Project for the Assembly Office of Research for the State of California from 1990 to 1991. Proposition 13 is the controversial property tax law enacted in 1978 that limited property taxes to no more than one percent of the assessed value of a property. As a result of his expertise, Sheffrin is often called upon to discuss the long-term implications of the law and the impact it has had on California's businesses and residents Sheffrin is also frequently interviewed on other local and national tax issues. He has co-authored two college textbooks with fellow economist Arthur O'Sullivan.
