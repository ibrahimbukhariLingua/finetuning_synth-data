## Main research contributions


### Recursive equilibrium theory

He is probably best known for his contributions to recursive competitive theory, an equilibrium concept widely used in modern dynamic macroeconomics, which he developed jointly with Edward C. Prescott.


### Determinants of the equity premium

Another strand of his research focuses on understanding the determinants of the 'equity premium', the return earned by a diversified portfolio of stocks (such as the S&P 500) in excess of that earned by a risk-free security such as a Treasury Bill. In 1979 he and Edward C. Prescott observed that the real equity premium over the past 90 years in the US was 6.18%, an order of magnitude larger than that could be rationalized by neo-classical economic theory. They termed this the 'equity premium puzzle'. Attempts to resolve the puzzle have become a major research impetus in both finance and macroeconomics over the past thirty years.
