# Robert Schwarzenbach & Co



**Robert Schwarzenbach & Co** (also referred to as **Schwarzenbach, Huber & Co** or **The Schwarzenbach Enterprises**) was a Swiss American textile manufacturing concern. Founded in 1829, the concern was active in silk and jacquard manufacturing. In 1928, Schwarzenbach was the largest textile company in the world exceeding 28,000 employees worldwide with a net turnover of 267 million Swiss francs. The majority of sales were generated in the United States through the subsidiary Schwarzenbach, Huber & Co based in New York City. In 1981, all manufacturing activities were seized and the concern was converted into a private real estate and investment vehicle currently still owned and managed by the Schwarzenbach family.
