## History

Reflecting its name, it started off as a company producing wine in the Limassol district. In 1951, it ventured into beer production by importing expertise from Czechoslovakia. Its product range has since expanded to include dessert wines (e.g. Commandaria), bottled water, brandy, spirits (including zivania), juices and canned food. The company is also an active participant at the annual Limassol wine festival. The company, till today, markets a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic products locally and in over thirty countries worldwide. Following Cyprus’ accession to the European Union in 2004, KEO expanded its operations on continental Europe. Its shares are listed on the Cyprus Stock Exchange.

## Wine Production

KEO operates four different wineries across four different vineyards – situated at an altitude of approximately 1,000 meters above sea level.

Its wineries are among the first to be built on the island. All four wineries are in close proximity to the vineyards where research is carried out in an effort to increase and safeguard the varieties of grapes, selecting those that will yield the best quality of wine when grown under the local climate. KEO has historically experimented with varieties and cultivation methods whilst it has invested a great deal of resources into rediscovering Cyprus indigenous grape varieties of Mavro and Xynisteri, many of which date back to the classical times, a period when the Cypriot wine reflected the island’s heritage.


## KEO beer

In order to meet the ever-increasing demand, the company has carried out substantial extensions to the plant and the equipment now being the most up-to-date machinery in the brewing industry. The brewery is currently capable of producing over 30,000 hectoliters of beer monthly. Keo beer was awarded a Gold Medal by the Brewing Industry International Awards.
