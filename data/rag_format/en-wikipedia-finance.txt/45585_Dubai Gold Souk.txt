# Dubai Gold Souk



**Dubai Gold Souk** or **Gold Souk** (Arabic: سوق الذهب), is a traditional market (or *souk*) in Dubai, UAE. The souk is located in Dubai's commercial business district in Deira, in the locality of Al Ras. The souk consists of over 380 retailers, most of whom are jewelry traders.

As of 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, some of the shops are four decades old, while others are new. The major items that the mall deals in are gold, platinum, diamonds and sometimes silver.

Dubai Gold Souk is bordered to the north by the Dubai Fish and Vegetable Market and the Deira Corniche near Baniyas Square at Sikkat al-Khali Street which is in close proximity to the Deira Bus Stand. On the other side of the Dubai Creek lies Dubai Textile Souk.

Dubai Gold Souk will be soon renovated. The Dubai Municipality plans to make Dubai Gold Souk an upbeat tourist destination.


## Guinness World Record

The Dubai Gold souk was host to the largest ring in the world weighing 64 kg. The piece is owned by Dubai-based Taiba.


## 2023 Prices Drop

On May 23, gold prices dropped in the UAE, having been weighed down by a stronger dollar and hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve members, after the spot price of gold shed 0.47% to $1,960.47 per ounce. This resulted in shortages for the Dubai Gold Souk.
