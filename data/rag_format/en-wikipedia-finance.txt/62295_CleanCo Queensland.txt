# CleanCo Queensland



**CleanCo Queensland** is a Queensland Government-owned corporation. CleanCo owns and operates a range of electricity generation assets in Queensland, including run-of-the-river and pumped-storage hydroelectricity, gas-fired power plants, grid-scale solar farms and wind farms. The Queensland Government has a long-term ambition to generate 50 per cent of the stateâ€™s electricity from renewable sources by 2030. CleanCo was established in 2018.

The two ministers responsible for CleanCo are the Treasurer of Queensland and the Minister for Energy and Clean Economy Jobs. The company was launched with an initial $250 million grant to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy capacity.


## Assets

CleanCo Queensland was created through the transfer of assets from CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation by the state government, with a mandate to increase competition in the energy market and with the intent of supporting the government's renewable energy target.

The assets transferred from the two other government-owned corporations are:

* Swanbank Power Station
* Wivenhoe Power Station
* Kareeya Hydro Power Station
* Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station
* Koombooloomba Hydro Power Station

CleanCo took control of these assets on 31 October 2019.

CleanCo is establishing the Swanbank Clean Energy Hub at the site of the former Swanbank Power Station. The hub features a 250 MW/500 MWh big battery, an onsite solar farm and green hydrogen production facilities.


## Management

Maia Schweizer was the inaugural CEO of CleanCo. Tom Metcalfe took over the role in July 2022.
