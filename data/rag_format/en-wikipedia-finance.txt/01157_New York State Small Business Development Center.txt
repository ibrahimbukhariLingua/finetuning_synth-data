# New York State Small Business Development Center



The **New York Small Business Development Centers** (NYSBDC) is a partnership program that provides business advising and training to small business owners and entrepreneurs across New York State. Established in 1984, it is part of the national network of Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) and is primarily funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), the State of New York, and host institutions. The NYSBDC is administered by the State University of New York (SUNY) system. It is an accredited member of the national Association of Small Business Development Centers.


## Overview

The NYSBDC operates as a decentralized network with 20 regional centers and numerous outreach offices hosted by SUNY and other higher education institutions across New York State. These centers offer no-cost counseling and low-cost training to aspiring and existing small business owners. Services are tailored to assist businesses at various stages, from startups to established companies seeking growth or operational improvements. Key areas of assistance include business plan development, financial management, marketing and sales, operations, and access to capital. The program emphasizes contributing to the economic growth of New York State by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.

According to the Association of Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs nationally provide educational assistance to strengthen small and medium-sized business management, contributing to local, state, and national economic growth.


## History

The New York Small Business Development Center was founded in 1984 as part of a nationwide initiative by the Small Business Administration to foster small business growth and economic development. The program's establishment in New York coincided with a broader national effort to decentralize business assistance and provide localized support to entrepreneurs. Administered through the State University of New York system, the NYSBDC leveraged the resources and infrastructure of SUNY campuses across the state to establish a widespread network of service centers.

Early initiatives focused on providing basic business counseling and training to help small businesses start and grow. In 1991, the NYSBDC Central Office established a Central Library to support its personnel with reference services and resource management. This was followed by the creation of a research unit in 1993, which addressed approximately 7,000 information requests annually from SBDCs across the United States, demonstrating the NYSBDC's role in the national SBDC network's knowledge infrastructure.

The NYSBDC played a significant role in disaster recovery efforts following the September 11 attacks. In 2001, the LaGuardia Community College SBDC was specifically established as part of the program's response to the economic disruption caused by the attacks, highlighting the NYSBDC's adaptability to regional economic crises.


## Focus on Leading Industries

More recently, the NYSBDC has emphasized specialized programs and initiatives that align with key industries in New York State, including advanced manufacturing, agribusiness, clean energy, life sciences, and technology. The network has also shifted its focus from primarily supporting startups to assisting businesses in the growth stage, helping them scale operations, increase market reach, and adopt innovative practices. Additionally, the NYSBDC provides targeted resources and training to help businesses navigate economic fluctuations and technological advancements.


## Regional Centers and Notable Changes

## Impact and Recognition

Studies and reports from organizations like the Government Accountability Office and independent research groups highlight the SBDC network's positive contributions to small business survival rates, job creation, and revenue growth across the United States. Individual success stories of businesses assisted by NYSBDC are often featured on the NYSBDC website and in local news outlets, showcasing the program's tangible benefits to entrepreneurs and local communities throughout New York.
