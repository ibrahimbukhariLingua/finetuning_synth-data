## History

Hebrew Free Loan Societies are based on the Biblical injunction "If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, do not act towards them as a creditor; exact no interest from them." (Exodus 22:24) Jewish communities throughout history have included these organizations as one of the pillars of communal life.

The Hebrew Free Society of Greater Philadelphia was founded in 1984 through the efforts of Rabbi Aaron Landes z"l. Bernard and Marie Granor agreed to spearhead the original effort and Bernard served as President of the Society for more than 20 years.
