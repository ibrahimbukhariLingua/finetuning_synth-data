# Remo Ruffini (businessman)



**Remo Ruffini** (born in Como, August 1961) is an Italian billionaire businessman, the chairman and CEO of the fashion company Moncler, and controls Double R Srl.


## Early life

Remo Ruffini is the son of Gianfranco Ruffini who, in the 1970s, was owner of a clothing company in the US called Gianfranco Ruffini Ltd. His mother, Enrica, also owned a clothing company.


## Career

Ruffini started his career in the US, working for his father's eponymous company.

When he was 23, he returned to Italy and founded a company, New England, which he sold sixteen years later to Stefanel Group. That same year, he started working as a creative consultant for the holding company which owned Moncler.

In 2003, Ruffini took over Moncler, which was almost bankrupt at the time, and transformed the company by reinventing the brand.

In 2006 and 2009, respectively, Ruffini launched the new collections Moncler Gamme Rouge and Moncler Gamme Blue, which debuted on the runways of Paris and Milan. Both lines were discontinued to make way for the Moncler Genius project, introduced in 2018.

In 2010, Ruffini launched Moncler Grenoble in New York, a technical collection designed both for skiing and après-ski moments, reinterpreting past styles with a contemporary twist.

In December 2013, Ruffini took the company public by listing it on Milan's stock exchange. Within the first afternoon, the share price rose 47%. It was one of Italy's most successful IPOs at the time and he subsequently earned a place on the Forbes World's Billionaires list in 2014.

In 2018, Ruffini conceived the Moncler Genius project, where well-known designers create collections interpreting Moncler's identity that are released on a monthly basis.

Since 2018, Ruffini has served as a board member of Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana.

In 2019, Moncler became a signatory of the Fashion Pact, an agreement among leading fashion and textile companies to reduce the environmental impact of their activities. Ruffini served as a member of its steering committee from 2019 to 2023.

On December 7, 2020, Moncler announced the acquisition of Stone Island for €1.15 billion, and Carlo Rivetti, the brand’s president, became a shareholder in Ruffini Partecipazioni, now known as Double R.

In July 2023, Remo Ruffini was awarded an honorary degree in "Arts in Fashion and Entrepreneurship" by the University for the Creative Arts in London.


## Personal life

Ruffini is married, with two children, and lives in Como.

He owns a 180-ft yacht called "Atlante" and launched in 2015.


## Awards

Entrepreneur of the Year 2017 for Italy. In 2019, he won the Business Leader award at the British Fashion Awards and in 2024, he won the Trailblazer Award.


## Honours

Knight of Labour (Cavaliere del lavoro) - Order of Merit for Labour
