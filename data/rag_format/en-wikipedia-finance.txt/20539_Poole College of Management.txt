## History

The College of Management was established in 1992 to provide undergraduate and graduate management education.

Jon Bartley took over as the college’s dean in 1999. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2000, the college was accredited by the AACSB, and in 2002, the Master of Business Administration degree was created. Ira Weiss became the college's third dean in 2004.

In 2007, the graduate programs in the College of Management were named the Jenkins Graduate School of Management in honor of Benjamin (Ben) P. Jenkins, III, vice-chairman and president of the General Bank at Wachovia Corporation (retired). At the time, the graduate programs consisted of the Master of Accounting, Master of Business Administration and Graduate Economics Program.

In 2010, Lonnie Poole, founder of Raleigh-based Waste Industries, and his wife Carol Johnson Poole, announced a generous gift to North Carolina State University. The gift included an endowment to support NC State's College of Management, now named the Lonnie C. Poole Jr. College of Management.

Steve and Judy Zelnak made a $4 million donation to the College in 2014. Part of that donation was the endowment of the dean's chair. Dean Ira Weiss, the college’s dean since 2004, was the first recipient of the endowed Chair.

In 2016, Ira Weiss announced she would step down as dean and planned to join the college's faculty.

Frank Buckless was named the college's fifth dean in May 2019, replacing Annette L. Ranft, who served as the college’s dean since 2016.
