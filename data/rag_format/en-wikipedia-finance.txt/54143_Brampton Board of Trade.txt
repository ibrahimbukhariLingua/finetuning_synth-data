### Brampton Santa Claus Parade

Brampton's Santa Claus parade stopped in the mid-1970s. In 1985, the Brampton Board of Trade started planning a Santa Claus parade for 1986; simultaneously, the Jaycees were intending to start a parade in 1987. With City co-operation, the Board's parade launched in 1986, with Jaycee assistance in marshalling. That year's program was announced to include forty community entrants, sponsored by companies, but ended up with 52 units. In recent years, it has included over 100 units. The parade moved to a "night parade" format in 1995.

The parade route has expanded from Vodden to south of Wellington Street (1986) to Sproule to south of Elgin Street. Temporarily it is on Bramalea Road because of construction in downtown Brampton.

The parade is always on the Third Saturday in November

The Board claims an in-person attendance of 160,000 (2012). It claims to be the largest single-day event in the Regional Municipality of Peel, and the largest night parade in Canada. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has named the parade as the Best Community Lighted Parade in Canada.

The program was broadcast on Rogers TV Brampton, which claimed viewership of over 250,000 between live and repeat broadcasts.

The Board of Trade stopped hosting the parade in 2017, and it is now run by The Brampton Santa Claus Parade Committee Inc.
