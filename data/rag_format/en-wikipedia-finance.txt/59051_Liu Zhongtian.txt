In 2021, the US authorities indicted six of his companies involved in a $1.8 billion tariff-evasion scheme. Aluminum extrusions were disguised as pallets to avoid anti-dumping duties imposed in 2011 and stockpiled in several warehouses in Southern California. He was also trialed for faking sales of his aluminum through a shell company of his. His group was fined $1.8 billion, and declared bankruptcy in 2022. It was revealed that the group had essentially grown through debt-fueled acquisitions.
