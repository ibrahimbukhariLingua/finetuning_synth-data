European Central Securities Depositories Association


# European Central Securities Depositories Association



**European Central Securities Depositories Association** (**ECSDA**) is the official trade association for the Central Securities Depository industry in Europe. The association provides a forum for Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) to exchange views and take forward projects of mutual interest.

It aims to promote a constructive dialogue between the CSD community, European and Global public authorities and other stakeholders aiming at contributing to an efficient and risk-averse infrastructure for financial markets. It is one of five regional CSD associations of World Forum of CSDs.


## History

The history of the ECSDA dates back to the early 1990s, when CSD chief executives started to meet on a regular basis to exchange best practices and prepare for the adoption of the euro. The idea of formalising these contacts in an association emerged in 1995 at a meeting taking place at the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt. The association was established in November 1997 with the signature of the first original Statutes of the association in Madrid by the 13 founding members and registered in Brussels Belgium.

Since May 2017, ECSDA is led by Anna Kulik, Secretary General of the association. The Association is governed by the General Meeting of its members, the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. The association governance is specified in the "Articles of the Association" and its by-laws. While the General Meeting gathers the representatives of the ECSDA Members, the Board Directors are appointed in a personal capacity.

The association holds regular expert discussions and conferences. In 2018, ECSDA held a "Conference on new technology for Financial Market Infrastructures". In 2019, ECSDA held a conference “Towards the Financial Market Infrastructures of Tomorrow”.

In March 2022, in reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Central Securities Depository Association suspended the Russian depository National Settlement Depository (NSD) from membership in the association.
