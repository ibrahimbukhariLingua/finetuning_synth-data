Nevada Policy


# Nevada Policy



**Nevada Policy**, formerly the **Nevada Policy Research Institute**, is a private, non-profit, conservative and libertarianâ€‘leaning think tank based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Nevada Policy seeks to promote libertarian causes in Nevada and western United States politics.


## Overview

Nevada Policy researches education, tax and fiscal policy, and labor issues related to public policy.


### Funding

Contributors include the Donors Capital Fund and the Cato Institute.


### LVCVA

On November 30, 2008, the *Las Vegas Review Journal* published an article regarding some investigative journalism conducted by Nevada Policy on the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. According to Nevada Policy's investigation, it appears the LVCVA has an inappropriate relationship with a private marketing firm, R&R, that has overbilled the LVCVA but the LVCVA has never attempted to *recoup these losses.*

Through public records request Nevada Policy found that the LVCVA not only knew about these irregularities but literally gave R&R the rubber stamp to approve expenditures above $5,000 without any oversight from the LVCVA.

According to Nevada Policy's vice president, "In the days following the release of this project, multiple private investigators visited the institute's offices requesting our financial statements and claiming to be working for "the other side." Some of our board members have been approached with broad hints about retaliation if the institute's look into convention authority financing proceeds."


## Positions


### Education

Nevada Policy opposes efforts to halt the opening of new charter schools and favors expanding charter school options, tuition tax credits, school voucher programs, and merit pay for teachers.

Nevada Policy has been critical of the Nevada System of Higher Education, specifically the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the University of Nevada, Reno for low graduation rates, despite spending above average per full-time student on education and education related higher education expenditures.


### Tax and fiscal policy

Nevada Policy supports a balanced budget with controlled growth in government spending, such as a TABOR's or TASC amendment. Nevada Policy claims Nevada's 2008-2009 budget deficit was the result of excessive growth in government spending.

Nevada Policy has also argued that Nevada's history as a low-tax state has been slowly eroded by a growing number of fees on Nevada's residents.

Nevada Policy opposes tax hikes on individual taxpayers and corporations within Nevada, including a tax hike on the gaming industry.


### Labor issues

Nevada Policy supports protecting secret ballot boxes and paycheck protection and opposes defined benefit plans for union and government workers.
