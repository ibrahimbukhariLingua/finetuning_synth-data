By 2000, AirPlus had enabled exporting of transaction information to SAP R/3 using an SAP module called "Sara" (*SAP Airplus Reisekosten-Abrechnungssatz*) in the data format "Lars" (Lufthansa Airplus *Abrechnungs-Satz*).

In 2005, AirPlus launched AIDA (AirPlus Integrated Data and Acceptance), a virtual credit card solution, whereby sixteen-digit payment card numbers are generated under the Mastercard prefix, which can be used for a limit number of transactions.
