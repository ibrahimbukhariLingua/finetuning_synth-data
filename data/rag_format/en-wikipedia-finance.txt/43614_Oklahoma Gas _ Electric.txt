OG&E Electric Services serves more than 850,000 customers in central and western Oklahoma and western Arkansas, and has no current wholesale power commitments. OG&E, with seven power plants is capable of producing about 6,100 megawatts from fossil fuels, also owns three wind farms and two small solar farms. OG&E also has long-term power purchase agreements with three non-owned wind farms. In 2017 OG&E generated 54% of electricity from low-sulfur Wyoming coal and 39 percent from natural gas with the remaining 7 percent coming from renewables, mostly wind.

OG&E owns roughly 450 megawatts of wind power. Under the plan announced on October 29, 2007, President and CEO Peter Delaney announced that wind power could be increased to about 770 MW.

OG&E is the largest electric utility in the state of Oklahoma. The company delivers all of its electricity across an interconnected transmission and distribution system spanning 30,000 square miles (78,000 km²).
