Basilikon


# Basilikon



The ***basilikon*** (Greek: βασιλικόν [νόμισμα], "imperial [coin]"), commonly also referred to as the ***doukaton*** (Greek: δουκάτον), was a widely circulated Byzantine silver coin of the first half of the 14th century. Its introduction marked the return to a wide-scale use of silver coinage in the Byzantine Empire, and presaged the total abandonment of the gold coins around the middle of the century.


## History

The *basilikon* was introduced shortly before 1304 by Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328), in direct imitation of the Venetian silver ducat or *grosso*, chiefly to pay the mercenaries of the Catalan Company. The Byzantine coin closely followed the iconography of the Venetian model, with a seated Christ on the obverse and the two standing figures of Andronikos II and his son and co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos (r. 1294–1320) replacing St. Mark and the Doge of Venice on the reverse. The similarity was reinforced by the name of the new coin: the *ducato*, the "coin of the doge", became the *basilikon*, the "coin of the *basileus*", although the contemporary Greek sources usually call both *doukaton*.

The *basilikon* was of high-grade silver (0.920), flat and not concave (scyphate) as other Byzantine coins, weighing 2.2 grams and officially traded at a rate of 1 to 12 with the gold *hyperpyron* or two *keratia*, the traditional rate for Byzantine silver coinage since the days of the hexagram and the *miliaresion*. The actual rate, however, was usually lower, and fluctuated depending on the changing price of silver: contemporary sources indicate actual rates of 12.5, 13, or 15 *basilika* to the *hyperpyron*. Examples of half-*basilika* are also known to have been minted.

In the 1330s and 1340s, however, the *basilikon'*s weight was much reduced, as a result of a silver shortage affecting all of Europe and the Mediterranean, falling to 1.25 grams by the late 1340s. It ceased to be struck in the 1350s, and was replaced circa 1367 with the new, heavier *stavraton*.
