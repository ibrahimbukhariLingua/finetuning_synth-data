## Dispute with Jim Rogers

In 2003, his widely circulated e-mail exchange with the famous global investor Jim Rogers made Alimov, then a student at Harvard Business School, a prominent figure among businessmen and government officials. The dispute started after Rogers’ lecture at HBS. The co-founder of the Quantum Fund described Russia as a hopeless place for investors. Alimov wrote an e-mail to Rogers claiming that his statements and facts on Russia were not well-grounded. A long-lasting e-mail exchange that followed was eventually read by Alimov's fellow-students as well as businessmen and people from all around the world. The story was covered by The New Yorker, The New York Post, and other international media.
