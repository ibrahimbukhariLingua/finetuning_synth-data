## History

Established in 1956 as the United States Air Force Security Service Federal Credit Union, the credit union first opened its doors at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, with eight members and $25 in deposits. In 1968, the board of directors voted to shorten the credit union’s name to Security Service Federal Credit Union. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, Security Service offers a suite of traditional financial products and services.


## Corporate headquarters

Security Service Federal Credit Union opened its first corporate headquarters in San Antonio at Hwy 90. Headquarters were then moved in 2001 to a new 128,000 sq. ft. facility located on La Cantera Parkway in San Antonio. Due to continued growth and expansion, Security Service relocated its corporate offices to a new campus located at 15000 IH-10 West in San Antonio, which houses more than 700 employees and offers operations and amenities buildings.


## Mergers and acquisitions

Initiated by other credit unions and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), mergers and acquisitions have assisted in the expansion of the Security Service Federal Credit Union field of membership. These mergers are also responsible for the credit union’s entry into the Colorado and Utah markets. A merger with the Fort Carson Federal Credit Union in 1980 brought Security Service to Colorado Springs, Colorado. In December 2010, the NCUA approved the credit union’s offer to assume Salt Lake City's Beehive Credit Union's assets, making its first presence in the cities of Salt Lake City, Provo, Riverton, Sandy, South Jordan and St. George, Utah. Since 1974, Security Service has merged and acquired 21 credit unions located in Texas, Colorado and Utah.
