List of Australian railway companies


# List of Australian railway companies



While railways in some states were briefly operated as private companies, railways of Australia have historically operated as Government instrumentalities.

The earlier form of a single state government railway department in each state no longer exists – with complex relationships developed by state and federal government corporations operating in multiple locations and across borders between states.

They are further divided into 'above' and 'below' rail companies – track owners, and train operators. Some companies are both.
