## Background

Aarhus Business College was founded in 1865 under the name Aarhus Handelsforenings Aftenskole (English: The Aarhus Business Association Evening School). The Business Association had been established one year prior and its members had realized the need for education of businessmen and other traders and had started planning the school in 1864 with the first 36 students beginning in 1865. In 1905 The Business Folk High School of Jutland, designed by Hack Kampmann, was established and in 1956 the Business High School was spun off as an independent institution and moved to a different location and Folk High School changed its name to Århus Købmandsskole (Aarhus Business College).

The school has grown substantially since its beginning and today occupy three locations across the city, and all of them has been expanded over the years. In 2009, Business Academy Aarhus was spun off as an independent institution along with vocational programmes under Aarhus Educational Centre for Agriculture and Aarhus Tech.
