# Stuart Chase



**Stuart Chase** (March 8, 1888 – November 16, 1985) was an American economist, social theorist, and writer. His writings covered topics as diverse as general semantics and physical economy. His thought was shaped by Henry George (1839-1897), by economic philosopher Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929), by Fabian socialism, and briefly by the Communist social and educational experiments in the Soviet Union to around 1930, though Chase was broadly a modern American liberal.

Chase spent his early political career supporting "a wide range of reform causes: the single tax, women's suffrage, birth control and socialism." Chase's early books, *The Tragedy of Waste* (1925) and *Your Money's Worth* (1927), were notable for their criticism of corporate advertising and their advocacy of consumer protection.
In 1929 Chase co-founded Consumers' Research, a consumer protection advocacy organization.


## Early life

Chase was born in Somersworth, New Hampshire, to public accountant Harvey Stuart Chase and Aaronette Rowe. His family had been living in New England since the 17th century. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1907 to 1908 and graduated from Harvard University in 1910 as a public accountant. After graduating, Chase became part of his father's accounting firm in Boston.

Chase married Margaret Hatfield in 1914 and had two children, Sonia and Robert. He and Margaret were divorced in 1929, and one year later, he married Marian Tyler, a violinist and staff member at *The Nation* who collaborated with him on several of his books; she survived him by three and a half years.


## Career

In 1917, Chase left accounting and took a position with the Food Administration of the Federal Trade Commission in Washington, D.C. In the commission, Chase conducted investigations on waste and corruption, one of them being the meat-packing industry with Upton Sinclair.

In 1921, Chase joined, along with economic philosopher Veblen, the Technical Alliance, which later became Technocracy Incorporated, part of the Technocracy movement.
Chase also worked with the Labor Bureau, an organization that provided services for labor unions and cooperatives.

In 1927, Chase wrote *Your Money's Worth*, discussing advertisements that promise but fail to deliver products as advertised to customers who order them.
In 1927, Chase traveled to the Soviet Union with members of the First American Trade Union Delegation and was the co-author of a book that praised Soviet experiments in agricultural and social management.
In 1932, Chase wrote *A New Deal*, which became identified with the economic programs of American President Franklin Roosevelt. He also wrote a cover story in *The New Republic*, "A New Deal for America", which appeared days before Roosevelt promised "a new deal" in his speech accepting the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. Whether Roosevelt speechwriter Samuel Rosenman got the phrase from Chase is unknown.

Chase's 1938 book *The Tyranny of Words* was an early and influential popularization of Alfred Korzybski's theory of general semantics.

Chase supported United States non-interventionism and was against U.S. entry in World War II, advocating this position in his 1939 book *The New Western Front*. After the war, Chase became involved in social science. In 1948, he published *The Proper Study of Mankind* in which he introduced the social sciences to several college campuses.

In a 1952 article, "Nineteen Propositions About Communism," Chase criticized the government of the Soviet Union (dominated by Stalin), stating that its citizens, trade unions and farmers "had no power" despite the claims of Communist supporters. Chase also dismissed the Communist Party USA as "our minuscule menace" whose members consisted of "a high proportion of frustrated neurotics and plain crackpots as well as some high minded-idealists — a tragic group, this last."

Chase also quoted Herbert Philbrick (who had been encouraged by the FBI to infiltrate the Communist Party USA between 1940 and 1949) to the effect that "the McCarthyites and demagogues ... make the work of the FBI more difficult by confusing the innocent with the guilty."

In the 1960s, during the Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, Chase lent his support to the Lyndon Johnson administration's Great Society policies.

Chase died in Redding, Connecticut.


## Quotations

Chase is famous for the rhetorical question at the end of his book *A New Deal*, "Why should the Soviets have all the fun remaking a world?" That was a reference to the "socialist experiment" in the Soviet Union.

He is quoted in Hayakawa's *Language in Thought and Action* as having said, "Common sense is that which tells us the world is flat."


## Free Enterprise into "X"

On pages 95 and 96 of *The Road We Are Traveling*, under the heading of "Free Enterprise into 'X'", Chase listed 18 characteristics of political economy that he had observed among Russia, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain between 1913 and 1942. Chase labeled this phenomenon "... something called 'X'". Characteristics include the following:

1. A strong, centralized government.
2. An executive arm growing at the expense of the legislative and judicial arms.
3. The control of banking, credit and security exchanges by the government.
4. The underwriting of employment by the government, either through armaments or public works.
5. The underwriting of social security by the government – old-age pensions, mothers' pensions, unemployment insurance, and the like.
6. The underwriting of food, housing, and medical care, by the government.
7. The use of deficit spending to finance these underwritings.
8. The abandonment of gold in favor of managed currencies.
9. The control of foreign trade by the government.
10. The control of natural resources.
11. The control of energy sources.
12. The control of transportation.
13. The control of agricultural production.

16. Heavy taxation, with special emphasis on the estates and incomes of the rich.
17. Control of industry without ownership.
18. State control of communications and propaganda.
