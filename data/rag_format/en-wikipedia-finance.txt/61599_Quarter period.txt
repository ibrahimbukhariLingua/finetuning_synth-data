Quarter period


# Quarter period



In mathematics, the **quarter periods** *K*(*m*) and i*K* ′(*m*) are special functions that appear in the theory of elliptic functions.

The quarter periods *K* and i*K* ′ are given by

and

When *m* is a real number, 0 < *m* < 1, then both *K* and *K* ′ are real numbers. By convention, *K* is called the *real quarter period* and i*K* ′ is called the *imaginary quarter period*. Any one of the numbers *m*, *K*, *K* ′, or *K* ′/*K* uniquely determines the others.

These functions appear in the theory of Jacobian elliptic functions; they are called *quarter periods* because the elliptic functions {\displaystyle \operatorname {sn} u} and {\displaystyle \operatorname {cn} u} are periodic functions with periods {\displaystyle 4K} and {\displaystyle 4{\rm {i}}K'.} However, the {\displaystyle \operatorname {sn} } function is also periodic with a smaller period (in terms of the absolute value) than {\displaystyle 4\mathrm {i} K'}, namely {\displaystyle 2\mathrm {i} K'}.


## Notation

The quarter periods are essentially the elliptic integral of the first kind, by making the substitution {\displaystyle k^{2}=m}. In this case, one writes {\displaystyle K(k)\,} instead of {\displaystyle K(m)}, understanding the difference between the two depends notationally on whether {\displaystyle k} or {\displaystyle m} is used. This notational difference has spawned a terminology to go with it:

* {\displaystyle m} is called the **parameter**
* {\displaystyle m\_{1}=1-m} is called the **complementary parameter**
* {\displaystyle k} is called the **elliptic modulus**
* {\displaystyle k'} is called the **complementary elliptic modulus**, where {\displaystyle {k'}^{2}=m\_{1}}
* {\displaystyle \alpha } the **modular angle**, where {\displaystyle k=\sin \alpha ,}
* {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}-\alpha } the **complementary modular angle**. Note that

The elliptic modulus can be expressed in terms of the quarter periods as

and

where {\displaystyle \operatorname {ns} } and {\displaystyle \operatorname {dn} } are Jacobian elliptic functions.

The **nome** {\displaystyle q\,} is given by

The **complementary nome** is given by

The real quarter period can be expressed as a Lambert series involving the nome:
