## Kentucky Power acquisition

On October 26, 2021 Liberty Utilities agreed to acquire the Kentucky operations of American Electric Power in a transaction valued at $2.8 billion (US). The purchase is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, pending regulatory approval.

On April 17, 2023, the sale was terminated. The sale drew criticism from the Kentucky Attorney General and Kentucky lawmakers. In May 2022, Kentucky's Public Service Commission approved the sale, but only with modifications made to the sale. In December 2022, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission refused approval, stating "the sales' parties did not provide enough evidence to show the deal wouldn't have an adverse effect on rate payers." Although AEP and Liberty Utilities reapplied in February 2023, On April 17th they announced the termination of the sale.
