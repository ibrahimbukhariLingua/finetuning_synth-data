# 800 Saint-Jacques Street West



**National Bank Place** (French: *Place Banque Nationale*) is an office building in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The building is located at 800 Saint-Jacques Street at the intersection of Boul Robert Bourassa in the Quartier de l’innovation of Downtown Montreal, and is linked to Montreal's Underground City.

National Bank of Canada is the sole occupant of the building. The building is the third tallest building in Montreal (tied with neighbouring Victoria sur le Parc).


## History

In January 2018, construction and real estate development firm Broccolini purchased the plot of land for C$100 million. Before being purchased the site was occupied by a public parking lot.

600 De La Gauchetière was put up for sale by the National Bank of Canada shortly after groundbreaking in November 2018, with the proceeds going toward the construction of their new headquarters.


## Design

The building features a glass and steel facade that points upward toward the south. It will also feature an outdoor garden on the 40th floor and be surrounded a large public park in order to introduce more greenspace into Downtown Montreal and attract foot traffic outside of the National Bank of Canada's business hours.
