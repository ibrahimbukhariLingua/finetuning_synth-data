Pan American Life Center


# Pan American Life Center



The **Pan-American Life Building**, located at 601 Poydras Street in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana, is a 28-story, 322 feet (98 m)-tall high-rise building. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, it was built in 1980 as the headquarters for the Pan-American Life Insurance Co.

In December 2006, Pan-American sold the building to Equastone, a California real estate company. The Hotel Intercontinental, which adjoins the Pan-American Life Center and is owned by the insurance company, was not included in the sale to Equastone.

In December 2010, Stirling 601 Poydras, LLC, an entity composed of local investors led by Stirling Properties, acquired the Pan-American Life Center in New Orleans, Louisiana from Equastone Real Estate Investment Advisors, a private real estate investment firm in San Diego, California.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
