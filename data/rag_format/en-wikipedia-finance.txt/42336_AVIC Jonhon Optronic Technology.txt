## Background

In 1970 during the Third Front, the predecessor of Jonhon was established as an electronics factory in Yichuan County, Henan that produced aviation bolts for the Chinese military. After the Chinese economic reform that opened up China in 1980, the country focused on the economy and the factory which relied on producing military products struggled. The factory spent years gathering capital mainly from loans to move to Luoyang City.

In 1991, the factory moved to Luoyang and focused on producing electrical connectors, optical fiber connectors and other products for cvillian usage. In 1995 it passed the ISO 9001 standard. Afterwards the factory's business expanded rapidly. In 2002 with China Aviation Industry Corporation I as the initiator along with six other units, the factory was restructured to become a joint-stock company named China Aviation Optical-Electrical Technology.

In 2007, the company held its initial public offering becoming a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It was the first company in China related to national defense to become a publicly listed.

In 2012, the company along with Hisense Broadband formed AVIC Hisense Photoelectric Technology (now known as Qingdao Xinghang Photoelectric Technology) to expand the fiber optic connector business. In 2013, it acquired 48.18% stake in Xian Forstar S&T (now AVIC Forstar S&T) which is currently listed on the Beijing Stock Exchange. In 2015, it established a joint venture named AVIC Optoelectronics Precision to produce precision connectors.

On 6 July 2016, the company changed its name to AVIC Jonhon Optronic Technology Co., Ltd.

On 4 June 2021, US president Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14032 that listed 59 Chinese companies that are to be banned from receiving U.S. investments. Jonhon was one of the companies on the list.
