# Cercle des économistes



Le **Cercle des économistes** is a French think tank founded in 1992 by Jean-Hervé Lorenzi. The association is made up of 30 economists who are also French university academics. It is a non-profit organization whose mission is to organize and promote economic discussion and debate, which is open and accessible to everyone. Its members are distinguished by diverse approaches and varied areas of special competence, ensuring the richness and inclusiveness of its discussions.

Le Cercle des économistes organizes various annual events (with its own in-house team) such as Les Rencontres Economiques d'Aix-en-Provence which has turned into an international economic forum, the association releases also several annual economic publications and its members are frequently solicited by French and international media.
