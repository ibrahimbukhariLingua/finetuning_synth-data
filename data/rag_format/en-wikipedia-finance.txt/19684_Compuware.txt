# Compuware



**Compuware Corporation** was an American software company based in Detroit. The company offered products aimed at the information technology (IT) departments of large businesses, and its services also included testing, development, automation and performance management software for programs running on mainframe computer systems.


## History

In 1973, Peter Karmanos Jr., Thomas Thewes, and Allen B. Cutting established Compuware Corporation to provide clients with professional technical services. By 1978, Compuware opened its first remote office to service the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area. In 1992, the company completed its initial public offering (IPO) and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol CPWR. At the end of 1998, Compuware surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2003, Compuware moved their headquarters from Farmington Hills, Michigan, to a new headquarters building in downtown Detroit. In November 2014, the company's headquarters building was sold to a joint venture of Dan Gilbert's real estate group Bedrock Real Estate and Meridian Health for $142 million and renamed One Campus Martius. In December of that year, Compuware was acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for approximately $2.5 billion, becoming a privately held company. In the years after that, the company experienced a period of growth and reinvention of mainframe software.

In March 2020, Compuware was acquired by BMC Software for $2 billion. Compuware ceased to exist as a company, but all of its products remain available under the name BMC Automated Mainframe Intelligence (BMC AMI). In October 2022, it was announced that BMC's Detroit office will return to the northwest suburbs of Detroit, moving from One Campus Martius downtown to the Southfield Town Center in nearby Southfield.
