# Providence Business News



***Providence Business News***, nicknamed ***PBN***, is a bi-weekly business newspaper focusing on the economy in Rhode Island and Bristol County, Massachusetts.


## History

The newspaper was founded in March 1986 by Robert C. Bergenheim, who at the time was also publisher of the *Boston Business Journal*, and published its first issue that May. His son, Roger C. Bergenheim, has been the paper’s publisher for much of its history.

At the time it began, *Providence Business News* was one of three business publications in Rhode Island, the other two being *Business Fortnightly of Rhode Island* and *Ocean State Business*, both biweekly magazines. *Business Fortnightly* ceased publication in June 1986, and *Ocean State Business* closed up shop in 1990.

In 1987, Bergenheim sold his company, P&L Publications Inc., to MCP Inc. of Minneapolis, but retained part ownership in *Providence Business News*. Roger Bergenheim succeeded him as publisher of the Boston paper in 1988 and for a time David C. Dunbar, an advertising executive at *Providence Business News*, took over as that newspaper’s publisher, before Bergenheim returned to the post.

The paper was redesigned in 2004 by Creative Circle Media Consulting of Providence.


## Prizes and awards

PBN was named *2020 Newspaper of the Year* by the New England Newspaper and Press Association at the organization’s 2020 fall conference.
