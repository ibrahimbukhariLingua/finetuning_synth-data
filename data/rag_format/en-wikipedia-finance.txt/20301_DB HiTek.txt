## History

Dongbu Electronics was founded as a memory chipmaker in 1997, but later was transformed into a foundry company in 2001. Dongbu Electronics acquired Anam Semiconductor's foundry operation from Amkor Technology for 114 billion South Korean Won (US$ 93 million) in 2002.

Dongbu HiTek was established in 2007 as a result of the merger between Dongbu Electronics and Dongbu Hannong Chemical, both of which are subsidiaries of Dongbu Group. Dongbu HiTek changed its company name to DB HiTek when Dongbu Group was renamed DB Group in 2017.
