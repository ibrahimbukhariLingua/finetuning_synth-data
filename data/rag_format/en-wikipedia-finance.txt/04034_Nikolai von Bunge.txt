Bunge served his first tenure as rector of Kiev University from 1859 to 1862. From 1863 to 1864, Bunge was the deputy grand tutor and thought financial theory and political economy to Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich, the son of Alexander II.

## Ministry of Finance (1861–1881)

In addition to his academic career, he headed the Kyiv branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire and led the Kyiv Mutual Credit Society. On 23 April 1861, he was granted the rank of Actual State Councillor.

Bunge was a professor of the Kiev University, of which he served as a dean between 1859 and 1880, when he was summoned to St. Petersburg to become a deputy minister and then (since 1881) Minister of Finance. Five years later, he became Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, the highest position in the civil administration of the Russian Empire.

Bunge undertook a number of reforms with the aim of modernizing the Russian economy. He consolidated the banking system of the Empire and founded the Peasants' Land Bank (1882) which helped peasants to purchase land. He introduced important tax law changes which seriously reduced the tax burden of the peasantry. The head tax was abolished and the inheritance tax was introduced.

Bunge's policies towards the Russian industries were extremely protectionist. He promoted the construction of railways and spearheaded the first Russian labour laws, some of them aimed at reducing child labour.

However, in 1887 under pressure of conservative deputies, accusing him of incompetence and incapability to overcome the budgeted deficit, N.K. Bunge resigned.
