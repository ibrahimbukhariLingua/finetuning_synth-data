**Tyler Lindholm** (born May 18, 1983) is an American politician and former state legislator for Wyoming. A member of the Republican Party, Lindholm represented the 1st district in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 2015 to 2020.

Lindholm helped craft legislation in Wyoming designed to attract cryptocurrency start-ups and diversify the economy. A company he helped start was BeefChain, a tracking system for cattle and beef which used the Cardano blockchain. Members included Rob Jennings, the former WPVI-TV anchor and a co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition (which has since been disbanded); Avanti Financial Group and Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long (who would later challenge the U.S. Fed over its policy); and Wyoming state senator Ogden Driskill.

Following his 2021 election defeat, Lindholm became state policy director for Senator Cynthia Lummis. In 2023, he left Lummisâ€™ office to open a Wyoming chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a libertarian conservative political advocacy group.
