## History

Exim Bank Uganda was established in 2011 as Imperial Bank Uganda by two major investors, Mukwano Group, a diversified Ugandan business and manufacturing conglomerate, and Imperial Bank Kenya, a medium-sized financial services provider, based in Nairobi, Kenya.

On 13 October 2015, following the death of the Imperial Bank Group's managing director, the Central Bank of Kenya placed Imperial Bank Kenya under statutory management due to "unsafe and unsound business conditions to transact business" at the parent company. BOU took over Imperial Bank Uganda the same day. BOU promptly put the Imperial Bank Group's shareholding on sale. On 7 March 2016, Exim Bank (Tanzania) acquired the ownership interest that Imperial Bank Kenya formerly had in this bank and re-branded it to Exim Bank (Uganda).
