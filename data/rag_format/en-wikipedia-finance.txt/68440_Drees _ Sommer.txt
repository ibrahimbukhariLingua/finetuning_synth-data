## History

In 1970, Gerhard Drees, professor at the University of Stuttgart, and Volker Kuhne founded the engineering office Drees, Kuhne u. Partner in Stuttgart, which specialized in network technology, production planning, operational organization and construction consulting. Hans Sommer became a partner in 1973, and the office soon took on the name Drees & Sommer. Over the years, both the number of employees and the number of locations grew continuously. At the beginning of the 1980s, the company organized itself into a partner model in order to accommodate the constantly growing number of employees and locations. Individual companies were founded that were responsible for a certain number of employees and organized independently.

Drees & Sommer Aktiengesellschaft was founded in 1991. The individual companies are now united under one roof. Company co-founder Gerhard Drees became chairman of the supervisory board, Hans Sommer Chairman of the executive board. In 2017, Drees & Sommer AG was converted into an SE.

The company was initially entrusted with the project management of Stuttgart 21, for which it also prepared the feasibility study and handled the preliminary project. From 1996, it held a 10 percent stake in the project company DBProjekt GmbH Stuttgart 21. The stake was sold on August 1, 2001.

Dr. Johannes Fritz has been chairman of the supervisory board since the beginning of 2023, replacing Hans Sommer. The company is managed by the partners, who are also the owners of the company. In 2020, the company celebrated its 50th anniversary. Dierk Mutschler, Steffen Szeidl and Marc Sch√∂mbs form the management board from among the partners.
