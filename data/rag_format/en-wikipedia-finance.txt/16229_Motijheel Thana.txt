# Motijheel Thana



**Motijheel** (Bengali: মতিঝিল) is a central business district and a thana of Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is Dhaka's primary central business district, and also the nation's largest commercial and financial hub. Motijheel, located immediately adjacent to Dhaka's zero point, has the largest number of offices in Dhaka. Motijheel CBD also has one of the highest concentrations of high-rise buildings in Bangladesh. It has thus earned the title of the downtown and city centre of Dhaka and as the *bankpara*-*officepara* (neighbourhood of banks and offices) in Bengali.

It is home to the Bangabhaban presidential palace, the venerable Notre Dame College; and the Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country.

The area is served by the Dhaka Metro Rail. Shapla Square and Balaka Square are well known roundabouts in Motijheel.


## Etymology

The name Motijheel is a combination of two Bengali words, *moti* (Bengali: মতি), which means pearl; and **jheel** (Bengali: ঝিল), meaning lake. Hence, the name Motijheel literally means "Lake of Pearls".

There are two theories regarding the origin of its name. One suggests that during Mughal rule, a pond existed within the estate of Mughal official Mirza Mohammad Mukim, whose daughter is said to have thrown her jewellery into the water, leading the area to be named Motijheel. Another theory attributes the name to a canal that once flowed nearby, influencing the area's name.


## History

During the Bengal Sultanate, a Sufi preacher named Shah Jalal Dakhini lived in the area. His tomb is located within the Bangabhaban premises. Under Mughal rule, the area was known as the abode of Mirza Muhammad Mukim. The area was historically known as Dilkusha. It was the site of the Dilkusha Gardens, a property of the nawab of Dhaka. Armenians also lived in the area. The area became home to an official residence of the governor of Bengal and the viceroy of India. It later became the seat of the Governor of East Pakistan. The president of Bangladesh resides at the Bangabhaban in Motijheel. The presidential palace is surrounded by the Bangabhaban Gardens (formerly the Nawab's Dilkusha Gardens).

After the partition of India, Motijheel became the CBD of Dhaka during the 1950s and 1960s. The city's Notre Dame College was relocated to its present campus in Motijheel in 1954; and includes many prestigious alumni. The clocktower of the Dhaka Improvement Trust building was the tallest structure in East Pakistan. The Purbani Hotel opened in the 1960s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, several tall buildings were built in Motijheel. They are mainly the headquarters of Bangladeshi state-owned banks. For many years, the Bangladesh Bank Building located in Motijheel was the tallest building in Bangladesh. City Centre Dhaka of Motijheel is the current tallest building in Bangladesh and has been since 2012. In recent years, the emergence of a plethora of new CBDs in other parts of Dhaka has led to a neglect of Motijheel.
