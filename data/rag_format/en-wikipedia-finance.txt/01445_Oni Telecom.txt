## History

Oni was founded in 1998 and owes its creation to the liberalization of the Portuguese telecommunications market. The original shareholders were the four biggest national economic groups – EDP, Millennium BCP, Brisa and Galp Energia. During its first 4 years of activity, ONI operated not only in the business-to-business market but also in the business-to-consumer market.

Oni is deeply connected to the onset of the Next Generation Networks (NGN) in Portugal, which had a big boost in 2009. These networks proved to be fundamental in meeting the needs of corporate customers and, since then, Oni has been exploring its own NGN.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
