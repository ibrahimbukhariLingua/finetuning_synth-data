## Views


### Fiscal policy

Goldmann stated in 2022 to Tagesschau that the legal status of the 200 billion euro "Doppelwums", a government action to reduce the impact of rising energy cost, was likely to assessed by European Commission, with the outcome being unclear.

He stated that Eurobonds issued by Mozambique would be impacted by the state guarantees for them were found illegal by its constitutional court, arguing that the replacements of the bonds in 2016 had not resolved the question of the bonds validity.


### Colonial history

He has stated that some of the German attempts to avoid accepting responsibility for its colonial past were motivated by a “grave concern that this would give rise to a rule.” He defended the transfer of a returned Benin Bronzes to the Oba of Benin by the Nigerian Government, stating that the Oba was the current leader of the group from which it was originally stolen, and that a return to him was therefore appropriate from a human rights perspective. He described a theory that the Bronzes would no longer be accessible to the public as dubious.


### Armed conflicts

In January and April 2024, Goldmann was part of panels by Al Jazeera English regarding the causes of the dispute between Nicaragua and Germany and the subsequent case against Germany at the ICJ. In May 2024, German academics signed a letter in support of the right of students to protest the Israel–Hamas war, opposing police actions as long as the protests remained non-violent. He was critical of a public statement made by Bettina Stark-Watzinger made to the tabloid Bild, stating that she exposed the academics to harassment by the newspaper.
