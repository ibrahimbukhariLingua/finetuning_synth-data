School of Business and Law (University of Agder)


# School of Business and Law (University of Agder)



The **School of Business and Law** at the University of Agder, Norway, builds on academic traditions that date back to 1969, when the two-year economics and business administration programme was a cornerstone of Agder Regional College (ADH) in Kristiansand. In 1994, ADH was included in Agder University College (HiA) as a result of a national reform, and in 2007 the University of Agder (UiA) was established.

The School of Business and Law is considered a leading business school in Norway.

A four-year programme in economics and business administration has been given since 1988, and since 1992 the title *siviløkonom* has been awarded. The school comprises as a faculty all study programmes at the University of Agder in the fields of business administration and law. In autumn 2013, nearly 1,700 students were registered at study programmes belonging to the School of Business and Law.

The School's main base is in Kristiansand, but it also has students and staff at the UiA campus in Grimstad.

The School of Business and Law is formally organized as a faculty at the University of Agder, which was nationally accredited by NOKUT (Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education) in 2007.
