## Prize winners


### 2005

Eugene F. Fama, Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, was the first winner of the prize. He was awarded for his fundamental contributions to financial economics, in particular, for developing and investigating the concept of market efficiency, which is now a cornerstone in the field of finance.
The award was presented at Goethe University Frankfurt on 6 October 2005, preceded by an academic CFS symposium entitled “Market Efficiency Today”.

Fama is the joint recipient of the 2013 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel with Lars Peter Hansen of the University of Chicago and Robert J. Shiller of Yale University.


### 2007

Michael Woodford, Professor of Political Economy at Columbia University in New York, was awarded with the DB Prize 2007 for his fundamental contributions to the theory and practical analysis of monetary policy. Woodford has developed a theory of monetary macroeconomics that holds widespread appeal to academic researchers owing to its rigorous microeconomic foundations. Woodford has proved the immense practical value of his theory by analyzing the central role played by expectations and communication in the implementation of monetary policy.

The award ceremony was preceded by an international academic CFS symposium on "The Theory and Practice of Monetary Policy Today".


### 2009

Robert J. Shiller, Professor of Economics at Yale University, and Professor of Finance and Fellow at Yale School of Management, was awarded the 2009 prize for his contributions to the field of financial economics. Through his innovative work exploring the dynamics of asset prices, Robert Shiller has become a pioneer in the field of financial economics. His findings on the volatility of share prices, the occurrence of price bubbles and resultant crises, as well as on the distribution of macroeconomic risks are not only of great academic importance, they have also broken new ground in economic practice.

An international academic symposium titled “Financial Innovation and Economic Crisis” was held in connection with the award ceremony on 30 September 2009. Leading financial economists, including Nobel Prize laureate Robert C. Merton of the MIT Sloan School of Management and Otmar Issing, President of the Center for Financial Studies, discussed the topics explored in Robert Shiller's research.

He has not only contributed pioneering work of great academic importance, he has also made his findings accessible to a broad public.

The award was presented during the international academic CFS symposium "Global Perspective on Financial Crisis" on 22 September 2011 at Goethe University Frankfurt.
