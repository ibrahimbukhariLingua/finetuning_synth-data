## Kris Herrera lawsuit

Kris Herrera, a manager at 16 Handles in New York City, won a May 23, 2013 episode of the Food Network show "Giving You the Business," where he was promised his own 16 Handles franchise. Instead, he received a single, non-transferable share of stock in the parent company. Herrera has filed a lawsuit against the Food Network, Scripps Networks, 16 Handles founder Solomon Choi, and other entities, alleging breach of contract, fraud, and violation of his privacy rights. He claims he was misled and subjected to embarrassing situations during filming and that his daughters' images were used without consent.
