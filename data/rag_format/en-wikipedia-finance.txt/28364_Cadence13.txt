# Cadence13



**Cadence13** (formerly **DGital Media Inc.**) was a media company based in New York City that created, distributed, and monetized audio content, primarily podcasts. The company was founded in 2015 and was a division of Audacy, Inc. The company was helmed by chief executive officer Spencer Brown, Chief Content Officer Chris Corcoran and President John Murphy. It was a major podcasting network and has produced podcasts for actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, reality star Lauren Conrad, journalist Neil Strauss, and author Rachel Hollis. Cadence13 had partnerships with several other companies, including Goop, Crooked Media, and Tenderfoot TV.


## Background and history

David Landau and Spencer Brown worked together as co-CEOs for Westwood One and in 2015 founded Cadence13 as DGital Media, alongside venture capitalist Michael Rolnick. In 2017, Entercom purchased a 45 percent stake in DGital Media for $9.7 million.

In 2018, Cadence13 teamed up with the United Talent Agency to create Ramble, the "first podcast network devoted exclusively to online creators".

In April 2019, Cadence13 announced that it would be starting C13Originals, under which the company would release several new podcast shows featuring unscripted audio stories. The first C13Originals show released was *Gangster Capitalism*. In July 2019, a partnership was announced between Cadence13 and Nielsen Holdings, with Cadence13 being one of the first few companies under the Nielsen Podcast Listener Buying Power Service. On August 7, 2019, it was announced that broadcasting company Entercom had entered into an agreement with Cadence13 and Pineapple Street Media to acquire the companies.

Cadence13 was named one of Fast Company's "World's Most Innovative Companies for 2019".

In March 2020, Cadence13 announced that they would be launching a podcast with former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, titled *Yang Speaks*.

In early January 2024, it was announced that their parent company Audacy would be preparing to file for bankruptcy within the upcoming weeks. On January 7, 2024, Audacy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of the bankruptcy reorganization, Audacy has made a deal with its creditors to transfer control to them while cutting approximately $1.6 billion of its debt.

On March 21, 2024, Audacy announced it would be reorganizing its podcast division under the new branding of Audacy Podcasts. As part of the move, the company will be sunsetting the brand name of Cadence13 and moving the staff and content under the Audacy Podcasts umbrella. The reorganization comes as part of Audacyâ€™s plan to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
