## History

Edinburgh Worldwide started trading on 9 July 1998 and is the successor investment trust launched following the reconstruction of Dunedin Worldwide Investment Trust.

In turn Dunedin Worldwide was formed in 1990 and was the successor vehicle for the Northern American Trust, one of the earlier Scottish investment trusts established in 1896 to take advantage of investment opportunities in the rapidly changing American economy at the turn of the century. Northern American merged with Camperdown Trust in 1937 and came under the management of Dunedin Fund Managers when it was formed in 1984.

Baillie Gifford & Co Limited was appointed as investment manager and secretaries to Edinburgh Worldwide with effect from 1 November 2003. While the objective of aiming for capital growth by investing in stockmarkets throughout the world remained unchanged, the portfolio was reorganised.
