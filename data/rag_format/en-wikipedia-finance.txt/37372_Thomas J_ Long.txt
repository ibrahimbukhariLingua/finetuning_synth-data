**Thomas J. Long** (c. 1910 – 1993) was an American accountant and businessman who co-founded Longs Drugs with his brother Joseph.


## Early life and education

He was born in Covelo, California in 1910. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a business degree in 1932. After graduating, he was hired as an accountant by a predecessor to Deloitte.

In the 1930s, Mr. Long borrowed $25,000 ($376,000 in 2018) to open a drug store with his younger brother, Joseph in Oakland. That store would become the first of a 274-store chain which in 1996 had annual sales of $2.5 billion in five states as of the time of his death.

The *New York Times* quotes retail expertsʷʰᵒ? as saying part of the Longs' success was "an ability to have each store cater to the needs of its community."

He tried to avoid publicity and shunned extravagance, though he was reported to hold more than $70 million of the company's stock.

Long Business Library at the Haas School of Business bears his name. The Thomas J. Long School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences at the University of the Pacific is also named after him.
