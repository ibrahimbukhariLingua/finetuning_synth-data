## History

Axos was founded in 1999 as BofI Holding, Inc., by Jerry Englert, the founder of Bank of Del Mar, and Gary Lewis Evans, president of La Jolla Bank, with $14 million of startup capital. It began operations as Bank of Internet on July 4, 2000. The start date of July 4 was purposely chosen because it showed that the bank would be open on a day that other banks were closed due to Independence Day and because the internet bank represented "Independence from traditional banking".

It became a public company via an initial public offering on March 15, 2005. It offered 3,052,745 shares of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.

In October 2007, Gregory Garrabrants was appointed chief executive officer. Garrabrants earned $34.5 million in 2018, making him the highest paid bank CEO that year.

On October 1, 2018, BofI Holding re-branded as Axos Financial, and switched its stock exchange from NASDAQ to the NYSE. Bank of Internet was rebranded as Axos Bank.
