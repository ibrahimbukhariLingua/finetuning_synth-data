Marketing year


# Marketing year



A **marketing year** is a period of one year (or sometimes less), designated for reporting and (or) analysis of production, marketing and disposition of a commodity. (Disposition of an agricultural crop might include such uses as food, animal feed, industry, seed, and export, as well as changes in stocks.) Because of year-to-year fluctuations in production, much marketing and disposition of some commodities may reflect production that occurred during a previous calendar year. For this reason, analysis is often facilitated if the marketing year for a crop commences at about the time of harvest. However, world markets or other factors may also influence choice of beginning date for the marketing year for some commodities in some countries. Especially in the case of certain perishable fresh fruits and vegetables, the marketing year may be less than a full year in length, because economic activity of interest for reporting and analysis may be concluded within just a few months.
