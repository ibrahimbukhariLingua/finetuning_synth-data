## History

Founded in 2001 as an MVNE, Visage Mobile developed integrations with billing and Sprint network providers to enable branded mobility services. Visage Mobile was the back-end systems integrator for Mobile ESPN and Disney Mobile as well as Embarq wireless. In 2008, Visage acquired Agistics. In late 2008, Convergys purchased Visage's MVNE organization.

Visage launched MobilityCentral in 2008 and in less than a year was recognized by Network World as one of the Nine Wireless Companies to Watch and was chosen as a finalist for the AOTMP Innovation of the Year Award.

The company was acquired by Periscope Equity and merged with other acquisitions to form *brightfin* in 2021.
