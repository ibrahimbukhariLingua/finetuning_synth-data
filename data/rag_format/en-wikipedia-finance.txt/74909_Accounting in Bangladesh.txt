Accounting in Bangladesh


# Accounting in Bangladesh



In Bangladesh, the profession of accountancy was developed during the British colonial period. The basic requirements for financial reporting by all companies in Bangladesh were provided by the Companies Act of 1994. Today, it is represented by two professional bodies, the Institute of Cost & Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).

Chartered Accountants completed their trainings by practicing in firms that specialize in financial accounting, financial audit and tax. CMAs receive particular training in cost audit, management audit, and management accounting, as well as general accounting and taxation. Both the ICMAB and ICAB are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Commerce. The Government of Bangladesh considers both types of professional accountants equal with respect to employment in government services as per circular No.Com/PTMA/AP/2/19/87.
