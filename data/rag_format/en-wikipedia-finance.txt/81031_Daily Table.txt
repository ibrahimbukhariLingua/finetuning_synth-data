Daily Table


# Daily Table



**Daily Table** is an American chain of low price grocery stores.


## History

Daily Table was founded in 2012 by Doug Rauch, the former president of Trader Joe's. The not-for-profit company aims to sell healthy food at a price point suitable for working low-income families. Daily Table sells inexpensive produce and pre-packaged meals. Its prices are significantly lower than the lowest options at a traditional grocery store. Daily Table considers itself the first not-for-profit supermarket of its kind.

Daily Table opened its first store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on June 4, 2015. It has since opened up stores in Roxbury, Massachusetts and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Dorchester store is set up like a boutique grocery with wood crates and a window to a food preparation area. The company has plans to expand to Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.
