It added cinematic fun to the taste of looking into the world of crime that I thought I knew but didn't know." She praised the action sequences of the film and actor Byun Yo-han, who as a former police officer and a victim "is in charge of 'real action' [and] dedicated action was added to the emotions that were pressed tightly." Kim also appreciated the "realistic map of voice phishing and capitalism", she concluded, "it [the voice phishing call centre home base and process] is drawn as if it can be grasped by the hand, and the level of immersion is considerable."

Jeong Hwa of *Star News* reviewing the film opined that the film is educative and informative. It has "a didactic character." Jeong concluded, "*Voice* is an infotainment movie that is faithful to the two purposes of lessons and vicarious satisfaction. What you suffer knowingly is because you dig into your hopes and fears."
