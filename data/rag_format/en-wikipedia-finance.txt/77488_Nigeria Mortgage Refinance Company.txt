## Refinancing Cycle

The way NMRC achieves its objectives is as follows. The initial step is for a borrower to take out a mortgage loan from a participating mortgage lender based on the uniform underwriting criteria set by NMRC; in return the borrower will provide regular repayments of the loan principal plus interest. The borrower will also provide collateral in the form of a mortgage over the property to be purchased.

Second step is for the participating mortgage lenders to refinance the loans with NMRC. NMRC will refinance the mortgage loans of banks with recourse to the financial institutions. The participating mortgage lender will in turn, provide security over its mortgage portfolio in favour of NMRC.

The third step is for NMRC to raise its own funding by accessing the capital markets and issuing bonds. It will issue corporate bonds, which do not involve any pass through of the credit risk attached to the mortgages. NMRC acts as a simple intermediary between mortgage lenders and the capital markets. By using its size and credit worthiness, NMRC is able to raise funds at a cheaper rate for longer duration. This is attributable to the shareholders, capital base, quality of assets in its books and that it is regulated by the CBN and the SEC.
