Employee education benefits in the United States


# Employee education benefits in the United States



Educational assistance benefits are employee benefits that allow workers to participate in educational programs for free or at a reduced cost. These benefits are administered through education assistance programs. Education assistance programs are used by corporations to recruit, retain, and retrain employees and to increase goodwill with former employees and the public. They also serve as a corporate tax break.

Corporations with these programs include Walmart (Live Better U), Target Corporation, Amazon (Career Choice), McDonald's (Archways to Opportunity) and Kroger (Feed Your Future). The US Department of Defense also has a program called DOD Tuition Assistance that provides troops with funds for higher education and the US Department of Veterans Affairs has the Forever GI Bill for eligible servicemembers, veterans, and select family members. Some corporations employ private companies, such as Bright Horizons and Guild Education, to manage tuition payments to specific colleges and other education providers. According to Wharton College professor Peter Cappelli, a small percentage of workers use educational assistance benefits, but the programs "do reduce employee turnover and help businesses identify their most productive workers."


## History

US history has seen a rise and fall of benefits for working people. In 1875, the American Express Railroad Company established the first private pension plan in the United States. Other large businesses soon followed.

During the Great Depression, the US government's New Deal provided jobs and job skills training.

The post World War II GI Bill also provided opportunities for those who served. Following World War II employer health plans rose to 70 percent of all employers by the 1960s.

In the 1980s, US corporations began reducing training and other benefits for employees. The prevalence of employee education benefits programs was further reduced during the Great Recession, from 61 percent of companies surveyed in 2008 to 51 percent in 2018.

In 2021, a refound popularity among large employers has been met with skepticism. According to Peter Cappelli, director of Wharton’s Center for Human Resources, “They’re doing this because it sounds great and it’s cheap – almost no one can use them, they are all online/cut rate degree programs."


## Participation

Between one and ten percent of all employees typically use employee education benefits. Because many employees live paycheck to paycheck, and employers often reimburse workers instead of paying up front, about half of all money designated for these programs goes unused.


## Tax breaks

Employers may deduct all that they pay for the employee's educational costs as a business expense.

The US Internal Revenue Service allows workers to deduct $5,250 in employee education benefits from taxable income.
