# Wipro



**Wipro Limited** (/ˈvɪproʊ/ ; stylized in lowercase title) is an Indian multinational technology company based in Bengaluru. It provides information technology, consulting and business process services. It is one of the six leading Indian Big Tech companies. Wipro's services range from cloud computing, computer security, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analytics, and other technologies, present in 167 countries.


## History


### Early years

The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner by MH Hasham Premji as **Western India Vegetable Products Limited**, a manufacturer of cooking oils. In 1966, after Hasham Premji's death, his son Azim Premji took over as chairperson at age 21.

The company changed its name to **Wipro Products Limited** in 1977, followed by Wipro Limited, a syllabic abbreviation of the original name, in 1982.


### Shift to IT

In the 1980s, recognizing opportunities in computer hardware and software, the company established subsidiaries Wipro Infotech and Wipro Systems. In 1981, Wipro developed the first Indian minicomputer based on the Intel 8086 chip in an IISc lab. The software division began in 1984 with the development of a spreadsheet and word-processing suite but shifted to offshore software development in 1990.

By the mid-1990s, Wipro had become one of India's leading manufacturers of personal computers, peripherals, and medical diagnostic equipment. In 1998, the company reported being the second-largest software exporter from India, and gradually increased its focus on the higher-margin software services business which accounted for the vast majority of its profits.

During the dot-com boom of the early 2000s, Wipro became the largest company in India by market capitalization, reaching a value three times that of the next largest listed company, Infosys. Consequently, Wipro's majority shareholder Azim Premji was the richest Indian for five consecutive years.

In 2004, Wipro became the second listed Indian IT company to report annual revenues exceeding US$1 billion. By 2006, approximately 30% of its total revenue came from product engineering R&D services.

In 2007, Wipro introduced a line of supercomputers known as Wipro Supernova. In 2011, Wipro, in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), developed India's then-fastest supercomputer, SAGA-220, which was deployed at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.

In 2012, Wipro demerged its non-IT businesses into a new private company named Wipro Enterprises. Prior to this demerger, these businesses—primarily in consumer care, lighting, furniture, hydraulics, water treatment, and medical diagnostics—accounted for about 14% of Wipro's total revenues.

Wipro acquired cloud services company Appirio for $500 million in 2016, technology consultancy Capco for $1.45 billion in 2021, and SAP consulting firm Rizing Intermediate Holdings for $540 million in 2022.

## Criticism

In February 2023, Wipro faced criticism for reducing the annual salary package of new hires by 50%. This decision affected around 4,000 new hires, leading to backlash from employee unions like NITES, which called the move unfair and lacking transparency. Wipro stated that the revised offer was due to changing business needs and provided an immediate opportunity for candidates to start their careers.
