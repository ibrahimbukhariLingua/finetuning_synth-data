# Suez (company, 2015)



**Suez SA** (formerly **Suez Environnement**) is a French-based utility company which operates largely in the water and waste management sectors. The company has its head office in La Défense, Paris. In 2015, all the group's brands became SUEZ.


## History

Formerly an operating division of Suez, the company was spun out as a stand-alone entity as part of the merger to form GDF Suez (now Engie) on 22 July 2008. Engie remained the largest shareholder of the company with a 35% stake. On the stock market, Suez Environnement's share jumped 40% in value on its first day.

In April 2014, Suez Environnement signed 3 major water treatment contracts in India worth 61 million euros. In July 2015, the group Suez Environnement simplified its name to become Suez, after the group GDF-Suez changed its name to Engie, leaving the name Suez available again. In September 2015, Suez acquired Sembcorp's 40% stake in the companies' common joint-venture to provide water treatment and waste management in Australia.

On 1 October 2017 Suez bought the Water & Process Technologies unit from GE Power for 3.4 billion dollars and formed a new business unit called Suez Water Technologies & Solutions. Suez shares are listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels.

On 14 May 2019 Bertrand Camus was appointed as chief executive officer of Suez.

On 1 February 2022 SUEZ began a new chapter in its history with its acquisition by the Consortium of shareholders and the appointment of a new CEO, Sabrina Soussan.

As of 1 August Sabrina Soussan was appointed chairman and CEO of SUEZ.
