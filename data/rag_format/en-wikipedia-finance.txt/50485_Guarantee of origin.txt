Guarantee of origin


# Guarantee of origin



A **Guarantee of Origin** (**GO** or **GoO**) is an energy certificate defined in article 19 of the European Directive 2018/2001/EC ( previously in article 15 of the European Directive 2009/28/EC). A GO certifies attributes of electricity, gas (including hydrogen), heating and cooling, especially coming from renewable sources and provides information to energy customers on the source of their energy. Guarantees of Origin are the only defined instruments evidencing the origin of electricity generated from renewable energy sources.


## Certificate

In operation, a GO is a green label or tracker that guarantees that one MWh of energy has been produced from renewable energy sources. Guarantees of Origin are traded and when a company buys Guarantees of Origin, as proof for the electricity or gas delivered or consumed, the Guarantees of Origin are cancelled in an electronic certificate registry. This single standardized instrument makes it possible to track unique ownership, verify claims and ensure that Guarantees of Origin are only sold once.

Guarantees of Origin are issued electronically for a quantity of energy generation (1 GO per MWh), traded and redeemed (i.e. used) by suppliers as evidence for their customers of the source of the delivered electricity. Generation from renewable energy sources is the most sought-after attribute. Some countries issue Guarantees of Origin for all fuel types of electricity or gas generation (e.g. electricity from nuclear sources, low-carbon hydrogen).

Guarantees of Origin should not be confused with the Eugene Green Energy Standard or EKOenergy labelling scheme. Both provide consumers with more information about their power (transparency). However, Eugene and EKOenergy go further by requiring additionality. Eugene and EKOenergy are private initiatives whereas Guarantees of Origin arise from European regulations.


## Governance

The GO is standardized through the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) provided by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). The European Energy Certificate System standardizes trade, cancellation and use of GOs across AIB members.
