**Luis Julián Martín Carranza Ugarte** (born December 21, 1966) is a Peruvian economist, banker and academic. He served as Minister of Economy and Finance of Peru in the second presidency of Alan García, from July 2006 to July 2008 and from January to December 2009. During his first tenure, he championed several structural economic reforms that proved extremely successful. Peru achieved their highest continued average growth rates in recent history (8% average), the FTA with the USA was signed, technology and productivity gains in the country were the highest ever in recorded Peruvian history (40% yearly increments in capital investment), and poverty dropped dramatically (from 52% to 34% of total population). He was re-appointed in January 2009, during the Great Recession. Before being appointed Minister, Carranza was BBVA chief economist for Latin American and emerging markets.
