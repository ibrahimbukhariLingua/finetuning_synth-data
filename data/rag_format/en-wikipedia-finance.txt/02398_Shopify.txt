## History


### 2006: Founding

Lütke used the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails to build Snowdevil's online store and launched it after two months of development. The Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.
Shopify created an open-source template language called Liquid, which is written in Ruby and has been used since 2006.
