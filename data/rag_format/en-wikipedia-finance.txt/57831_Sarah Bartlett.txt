## Career


### Journalism

Bartlett began her career in journalism as a research assistant for a London-based documentary film company. She went on to work as a business reporter for Fortune magazine and The New York Times, where she led coverage of the banking and financial services industry. She later became an assistant managing editor at Business Week, a contributing editor at Inc. magazine and editor-in-chief of Oxygen Media

In 1991, Bartlett published "The Money Machine: How KKR Manufactured Power & Profits.” The book detailed the rise of investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which pioneered leveraged buyout transactions using investments from public pension funds.


### CUNY

Bartlett joined CUNY in 2002 as the Bloomberg Chair of Business Journalism at Baruch College. After CUNY opened a new graduate journalism school, Bartlett became a charter faculty member at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. She developed the school's concentrations in Urban Reporting and Business and Economics Reporting and co-founded the Center for Community and Ethnic Media. During her career as a professor at CUNY, Bartlett hosted "U$A Inc.", CUNY TV's weekly discussion program focusing on business issues.

Bartlett became the school's second dean in 2014.

In 2015, she led the school to launch a Spanish language journalism concentration that prepares bilingual graduates to cover Hispanic communities for media outlets in both languages. The program accepted its first students in 2016, placing them in internships at media outlets including Telemundo, Animal Político and NPR's Latino USA podcast.


#### Craig Newmark Journalism School

In June 2018, craigslist founder Craig Newmark made a $20 million gift to the school to further its mission of advancing good journalism by providing opportunities to people who might not otherwise get them. According to the New York Times, Newmark made his gift after meeting with Dean Bartlett and Jeff Jarvis, the school's Leonard Tow Professor of Journalism Innovation and director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.

The decision to rename the school after Newmark was controversial among some alumni due to craigslist's impact on the newspaper industry. Bartlett responded directly to alumni in an email, writing that the name change came "in recognition of the transformative effect it will have on our school."
