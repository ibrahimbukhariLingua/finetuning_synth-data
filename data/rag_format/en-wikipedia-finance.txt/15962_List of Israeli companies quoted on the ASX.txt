List of Israeli companies quoted on the ASX


# List of Israeli companies quoted on the ASX



As of 2019, 15 Israeli companies were listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. Nearly all achieved their listings via a so-called "back-door listing" where a currently-listed entity is used as a shell to house the new entity.

The ASX has traditionally hosted a large number of relatively small and early-stage companies due to a long history of mining exploration ventures in Australia. Accordingly, companies with market capitalization of as little as $5–$10m are able to list on the ASX and are not restricted to a secondary market- they list on the main exchange. This enables more liquidity than might be achieved on a US secondary market. Technology firms often seek relatively large amounts of capital to rapidly scale while still at modest market capitalizations. So smaller securities exchanges abroad (Singapore is another purported example) can be a favourable if unexpected option for listing, despite the geographical distance from their original base. Another perceived advantage is the absence of any cap on executive remuneration in Australia whereas such caps exist in Israel.

Performance of the companies has been mixed since the initiative began in 2016, with Weebit Nano the most successful of these companies as of 2024. Nevertheless Coby Hanoch, the CEO of Weebit Nano has expressed his desire to delist from the ASX when able to do so, saying the ASX is “50 years behind the world in dealing with technology and in dealing with the regulation.”.
