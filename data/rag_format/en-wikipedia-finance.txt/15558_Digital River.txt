In October 2017, after Digital River had decommissioned the FireClick platform and released the domain in 2016, the websites for Equifax and for TransUnion's Central American division were reported to have been redirecting visitors to websites that attempted drive-by downloads of malware disguised as Adobe Flash updates. The attack had been performed by hijacking third-party analytics JavaScript from FireClick.
