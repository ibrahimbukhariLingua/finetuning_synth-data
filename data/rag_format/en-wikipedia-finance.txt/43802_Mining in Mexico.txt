Mining in Mexico


# Mining in Mexico



**Mining in Mexico** represented 2.4% of the nation's gross domestic product in 2023 and employed 350,000 people in 2020. Mexico is the world's largest producer of silver and a globally significant producer of gold, copper and zinc. In 2020, Mexico produced the world's 12th largest volume of minerals by value.

Since 2018, Mexico's left-wing president has been taking a firmer stance towards mining companies and reforming mining regulations. President López Obrador was critical of (mostly foreign owned) mining companies' track record of environmental harm and tax avoidanceᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.


## Economy

In 2023, mining in Mexico represented 2.4% of the nation's gross domestic product, and 8.2% of Mexico's industrial GDP. The mining sector employed 350,000 people in 2020, and generated US$1.5 billion in direct government tax revenue, and an additional US$1.84 billion of government revenue from exports of mined natural resources.

Mexico is the world's largest producer of silver and a globally significant producer of gold, copper and zinc.

In 2020, Mexico produced the world's 12th largest volume of minerals, valued at US$17.8 billion.


## Politics

Mapping and consultations about mining in Mexico are led the by the Mexican Geological Survey government agency.

In January 2013, 500 activists met in Capulálpam de Méndez, Oaxaca at the *¡Sí a la vida! ¡No a la minera!* (English *Yes to life! No to mining!*) event. The event was undertaken to coordinate anti-mining efforts, perceived by the activists as harmful to their lives.

Mexico's left-wing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador halted issuing any new mining licences, and did not consider mining an essential business permitted to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. López Obrador has been critical of corporate tax avoidance and environmental damage, and has both reformed mining regulations and increased state control of mining operations. The president nationalised the nation's lithium reserves in 2022.

In 2023, the Canadian government noted the Mexican's government rapid action to improve the conditions of Mexican miners, after the Mexican government changed 20,000 collective bargaining agreements it perceived to be favouring mine owners at the expense of workers.
