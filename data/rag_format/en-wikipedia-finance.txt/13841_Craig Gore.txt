## Insolvency and bankruptcy

Gore was Bankrupted in 1992 after the failure of his advertising agency and the failure of his father's business. Gore's bankruptcy was later annulled after a meeting of creditors was called by the public trustee. In 2008, Secured Capital & Finance, a firm jointly owned by Gore and John Atkinson froze redemptions to its clients. The appointed liquidator CRSWarnerKugel found that Wright Patton Shakespeare, a financial advice firm then owned by the duo, had recommended that their clients invest in SC&F. The liquidator went on to describe the arrangement to "something akin to a Ponzi scheme", something denied by Gore. The liquidators investigations suggested that between 2001 and 2004, Secured Capital & Finance used investors' money to make interest payments to other investors, forward money to other companies with the Atkinson Gore Group owned by Gore and Atkinson. none of the liquidators claims were tested in a court nor was any public examination undertaken to test the veracity of the liquidators claims.

Wright Patton Shakespeare, which had been subsequently acquired by British Author Lord Michael Ashcroft, after negotiations with Gore, to settle claims by investors, offered to pay investors 10¢ in the dollar and take over their debts, before paying out 60¢ in the dollar over four years.

Gore's creditors accepted an offer which provided for a payment of 3 million dollars, over three years, and 30% of all profits from a Gore-controlled trust on 18 November 2010. His creditors decided to terminate the PIA on 24 February 2012. after the appointment of CRS Krugel were appointed as trustee to Gore Bankruptcy, which Gore contested was a direct conflict of interest as CRSWarnerKrugel had previously made unfounded claims against Gore and business partner Atkinson. Gore declared himself bankrupt and the Public Trustee ITSA consented to on act as official trustee 18 April 2012. Creditors concerned about the contents of the official trustees' report, voted to terminate the official trustees appointment and voted in Gregory Moloney of Ferrier Hodgson on 19 September 2012. Gore was released from bankruptcy in April 2015, after concluding no evidence existed to properly extend Gore's bankruptcy.
