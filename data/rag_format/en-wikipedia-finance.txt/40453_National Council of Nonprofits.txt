# National Council of Nonprofits



The **National Council of Nonprofits** (NCN) is the largest nonprofit network in the United States, with 25,000 nonprofit members and 52 state nonprofit network subsidiaries. It engages in public policy work and conducts professional development for nonprofit members, providing nonprofits with research and assets to assist their operations.


## History

The National Council of Nonprofits was established in 1990 to create a unified voice for nonprofit organizations across North America. Initially, NCN aimed to connect nonprofits through a national platform focused on advocacy and resource sharing. Over time, NCN expanded its partnerships to include state associations to address region-specific nonprofit challenges, offering a more localized approach to its support and advocacy efforts. Through these expansions, NCN created a federated structure to coordinate national objectives with state-level initiatives, attempting to balance centralized support with local responsiveness.

The organization has a 4-star rating on Charity Navigator.


### Leadership

Tim Delaney is the acting CEO of NCN and has served in the role for 16 years. In January 2025, National Low Income Housing Coalition CEO and public sector veteran Diane Yentel will take Delaney's place.

It hosts multiple webinars each year, increasing its revenue through webinar sponsorship fees of up to $10,000. The Federal Reserve and FEMA have sought its support in the past.
