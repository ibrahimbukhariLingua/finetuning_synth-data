# Austrian Business Agency



**Austrian Business Agency** (German: *Österreichische Industrieansiedlungs- und WirtschaftswerbungsgmbH*) (ABA-Invest in Austria) is the national investment promotion company of the Republic of Austria. The organization is responsible for acquiring and providing professional consulting services to foreign companies that intend to establish a subsidiary or business operations in Austria. ABA provides information about Austria as a business location and advises companies on all relevant issues. The business settlement agency was founded as ICD Austria by the ÖBAG in 1982, and renamed Austrian Business Agency (ABA) in 1995. On the occasion of its 25th anniversary in 2007, ABA changed its corporate design and now uses the name ABA-Invest in Austria instead of Austrian Business Agency, because it shows more clearly the purpose of the company. ABA-Invest in Austria employs a staff of 25 people.

ABA supported a series of prominent international companies such as Sony, Infineon, Ikea, Matsushita Electric Works, Hutchison Mobilfunk, Holmes Place and Starbucks in their setting up business operations in Austria.

A specialized organization belonging to ABA, Location Austria, has been promoting Austria as an international film location since 1998. Location Austria in cooperation with Austria Wirtschaftsservice GmbH (aws) is responsible for coordinating funding measures within the framework of the initiative "Film Industry Support Austria" (FISA). This comprises an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy to support cinema films based on a non-repayable grant amounting to 25 percent of the Austrian film production costs entitled to funding. Due to the major success of the initiative, the funding model "Film Industry Support Austria" (FISA) has been extended for another two years.
