Information is compiled from statistics on the annual value of production, intermediate consumption and added value of each economic activity, as well as indicators of growth in the volume of annual production and the annual index of prices of goods and services produced and the main inputs consumed. The methodology and database of the Report are completely integrated into the series of National Accounts, which has as initial reference the year 2002, with results consistent with the National Classification of Economic Activities (CNAE).
