CROBEX


# CROBEX



**CROBEX** is the official share index of the Zagreb Stock Exchange. As of March 2023, it includes stocks of 15 companies and is calculated continuously using the latest stock prices. It is measured using free float market capitalization, where the weight of each individual stock is limited to 10 percent.


## History

It began to be published on 1 September 1997, and the base date is 1 July 1997, when its base value was 1,000 points.

For a long time, the Pliva stock was one of the main constituents of the index, before the company was sold and de-listed.

In October 2007, its value was around 5,400 points, an all-time high. By March 2009, the index dropped to 1,300 points. In the first half of 2011, it hovered around 2,200 points, falling to below 1,800 by the end of the year. In October 2016, the index broke 2,000 points, the highest level since March 2013.

In April 2018, an exchange traded fund started tracking the index.


## Inclusion criteria

Stocks have to be traded in more than 75% of the total number of trade days in the selected time period in order to be included into CROBEX. The stock ranking is determined by weighing the stock's free float market capitalization as a proportion of the total, and its traffic as a proportion of the total share traffic in the six-month time period observed.

The index is revised every third Friday of March and September. The Index Commission can revise the index if the following extraordinary events happen:

* bankruptcy or liquidation of a company, increase or decrease in the base capital of a company, takeover, merger.
* removal of a stock listing
* long-term suspension of trade of a stock

There are also other circumstances related to the issuer or the stock that can affect the quality of the CROBEX index that can cause the commission to revise the index.

A special revision can happen to include a new stock in the index in case the stock, in the first 30 days since its listing date, is traded in 100% of the total number of trade days, taking into account its free float market capitalization and share of traffic.
