After the 1929 Wall Street economic crash it became difficult for Camp Madrue to survive the economic crash. In June 1930 the economic condition had worsened. In 1930 the Citizen Trust and Savings Bank which funded Chavers land purchase closed. The bank closed due to a "run on the bank", by depositors that feared losing their money. The run on the bank depleted the bank's reserves.
