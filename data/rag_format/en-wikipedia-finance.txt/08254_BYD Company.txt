BYD Company


# BYD Company



**BYD Company Limited** or **BYD** (Chinese: 比亚迪; pinyin: *Bǐyàdí*) is a publicly listed Chinese multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. It is a vertically integrated company with several major subsidiaries, including BYD Auto which produces automobiles, BYD Electronics which produces electronic parts and assembly, and FinDreams, a brand name of multiple companies that produces automotive components and electric vehicle batteries.

BYD was founded by Wang Chuanfu in February 1995 as a battery manufacturing company. BYD's largest subsidiary, BYD Auto, was founded in 2003 and has grown to become the world's largest manufacturer of plug-in electric vehicles. Since 2009, BYD's automotive business has contributed over 50% of its revenue. By 2023, it contributed over 80% of the company's total revenue. The company also produces rechargeable batteries (handset batteries, electric vehicle batteries and bulk storage), forklifts, solar panels, semiconductors, and rail transit network. Through its subsidiary FinDreams Battery, BYD was the second largest electric vehicle battery producer globally in 2023 after CATL, by producing 15.8% of the world's output.

BYD has been the privately owned company with the largest workforce in China since 2022, ranking only below several state-owned companies. As of September 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, BYD employs 900,608 people, of which 104,003 are research and development (R&D) employees. It also leads by patent applications, by filing over 13,000 patents between 2003 and 2023.

BYD's stock is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange with two types of shares (H and A respectively). The company was ranked 212th on the Fortune Global 500 in 2023.


## Name

"BYD" is the pinyin initials of the company's Chinese name *Biyadi.* The company was originally known as *Yadi Electronics* (亚迪电子), named after the Yadi Road in Dapeng New District, where the company was once based. According to Wang Chuanfu, when the company was registered, the character "*Bi*" (比) was added to the name to prevent duplication, and to provide the company with an alphabetical advantage in trade shows. As the name "BYD" had no particular meaning, BYD started adopting a backronymic slogan "Build Your Dreams" when it participated at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in the US.


## History

On 18 November 1994, Wang Chuanfu gathered a team of 20 people and founded BYD in Buji Town, Longgang District, Shenzhen. The company was formally founded on 10 February 1995 as Shenzhen BYD Battery Company Limited, with a focus on rechargeable nickel–cadmium (NiCd) batteries. Wang noticed an opportunity presented by the shift in Japanese companies from NiCd to high-value nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries while he was working as a vice supervisor at the Beijing Nonferrous Research Institute. He moved to Shenzhen with his cousin Lu Xiangyang and founded the company in 1995 to capitalize on the opportunity. Having achieved little success, in 1997 Wang moved his business, also consisting of a battery research institute to Longgang in Shenzhen, where BYD started receiving orders from multinational companies.

BYD grew its business in its early days by implementing a redesigned manufacturing approach by incorporating more manual labour, in contrast of the capital-intensive and highly automated processes in Japan. This manufacturing process, along with in-house production of key machinery, contributed to a substantial reduction in unit costs compared to Japanese competitors by around five or six times lower. BYD quickly became the world's leading NiCd battery manufacturer by July 2002, accounting for 65% of global production. Within seven years, the company secured its position as the second-largest producer of NiMH batteries and the third-largest in Li-ion batteries. By 2012, BYD had captured more than half the world's mobile phone battery market and was the largest Chinese manufacturer (and in the top four globally) of all types of rechargeable batteries.

BYD started producing mobile phone components in the early 2000s. Its electronic business was spun off in 2007 as BYD Electronics.

On 31 July 2002, the company underwent an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The company announced its target to become the world's second-largest battery firm. Shortly after the IPO, BYD acquired a small automotive manufacturing company, Xi'an Qinchuan Automobile, from state-owned defense company Norinco in January 2003, which was met with disapproval from shareholders, as the plan was not disclosed in the prospectus. Qinchuan was acquired with the intention of developing battery-powered electric vehicles. However, BYD's first cars were conventional petrol vehicle such as the BYD F3, with production starting in April 2005. The company produced its first plug-in hybrid vehicle, the BYD F3 DM in 2008, followed by its first production battery electric vehicle, the BYD e6 in 2009. In March 2022, BYD ended the production of pure internal combustion engine vehicles to focus on plug-in electric vehicles.

In September 2008, MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, invested about US$230 million for a 9.89% share of BYD at HK$8/share. Buffett credited this investment to Charlie Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman who saw the potential in the company. Since 2022, Berkshire had gradually reduced its shareholding in BYD after its share price increased significantly. As of June 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Berkshire held a 6.9% stake in BYD.

In 2016, BYD unveiled a working monorail prototype marketed as "Skyrail" (Chinese: 云轨; lit. 'cloud rail') and announced they will enter the global rail transit market. The first public Skyrail line opened as a 9.7 km (6.0 mi) long loop line in Yinchuan's flower expo in 2018.

Between 2017 and 2019, due to several factors such as the slowdown of BYD Auto's sales, BYD saw its net profit has falling sharply for three consecutive years, especially in 2019 when it dropped to CN¥ 1.6 billion. Wang Chuanfu described it as the "darkest moment", since at that time the company had only one goal, which was to survive. However, Wang insisted on investing CN¥ 8.4 billion in research and development. In 2020, BYD received the equivalent of €2.1 billion in Chinese state subsidies.

In 2020, BYD established four automotive component manufacturers spun-off from BYD divisions branded FinDreams, with the intention of supplying parts to other automotive companies.

Additionally, BYD disclosed in its financial report that the average annual salary for R&D personnel is around CN¥212,000.


### Manufacturing


#### Supply chain

BYD is characterized by its vertical supply chain system, originating as a battery company in 1995 before venturing into cars (via BYD Auto) in 2003. At the same time, BYD also leverages China's low labour costs, transforming production lines for power batteries from capital-intensive to labour-intensive, ensuring a competitive edge through a robust supply chain system and reduced production costs. Post-entry into the automobile industry, BYD developed the entire automotive industry chain, emphasizing core technology research and development. Proficiency in key components, such as batteries, motors, and electronic control was achieved, marked by a large-scale, fully automated production line for batteries. This vertical integration model strengthened its industrial chain and mitigates challenges such as the global chip shortage.

BYD diversified into research and development of semiconductor by establishing BYD Semiconductor in 2020. Core components, including automotive chips and the DiLink automotive intelligent system, were independently developed. The establishment of FinDreams companies from December 2019 focused on power batteries, automotive lighting, electronics, powertrain, and moulding.

In early 2020, BYD transitioned its the parts and components division into subsidiary companies, collectively known as FinDreams. This shift enabled independent operations for these companies, making component supply to other automotive companies easier.


#### Facilities

BYD has many production bases, including three locations in Shenzhen (one of which is on the self-titled 'BYD Road' (simplified Chinese: 比亚迪路; traditional Chinese: 比亞迪路; pinyin: *Bǐyàdí Lù*) in Pingshan District, Shenzhen), as well as sites in Huizhou, Shanxi, and Shanghai.

Auto production bases include an automobile assembly line in Xi'an, a K9 electric bus manufacturing plant in Dalian, a photovoltaic module (solar panel) Bloomberg New Energy Finance Tier 1 manufacturing plant in Beijing, an R&D center and nascent automobile assembly line in Shenzhen, and an R&D center in Shanghai.

US operations can be found in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, and San Francisco, California. BYD also acquired a site for a future North American headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, and has built and operates a manufacturing plant in Lancaster, California, near Los Angeles.

In 2019 a bus plant opened in Newmarket, Ontario to handle orders in Canada. BYD has three factories in Brazil, the first of which opened in 2015 for the production of electric buses. In April 2017, it inaugurated its second plant for photovoltaic modules. In 2020, BYD opened its third manufacturing plant in the country in Manaus, specifically for lithium iron phosphate batteries, for use in electric buses. BYD has two electric bus assembly facilities in Europe in Komarom, Hungary and Beauvais, France. BYD built a new facility in Chongqing, China for producing its blade battery, which are considered to be the safest EV batteries. The first plant of the company in India was opened in Chennai.

## Lawsuits and disputes


### In the United States

On 27 April 2020, BYD hired attorney Charles Harder and filed a federal civil complaint in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, against Vice Media alleging defamation for a story about BYD being associated with companies alleged to be using forced Uyghur labor in its supply chain which was published on 11 April 2020. BYD's case was dismissed with prejudice in March 2021.

In November 2020, BYD filed a libel lawsuit against Vice Media and the non-profit Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) and some of its employees. The Supreme Court of the United States rejected BYD's suit in August 2022.

In 2022, the United States Department of Commerce found that BYD had circumvented tariffs on solar panels by routing its operations through Southeast Asian countries. In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued final determination on BYD, determining they circumvented tariffs.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 proposed the prohibition of US defense funding for BYD batteries on security grounds.


### Foxconn disputes

In addition to patent litigation Foxconn sued BYD in Hong Kong and Illinois in 2007, alleging BYD poached 50 Foxconn employees and was complicit in the stealing of trade secrets to set up a competing cell phone manufacturing operation. Court proceedings were brought before BYD Electronic was spun off by BYD later in 2007, delaying the public listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange by half a year.

Foxconnʷʰᵉⁿ? also opened proceedings in the district where BYD is headquartered, at the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ which referred the case to the Supreme People's Court, which in turn commissioned an appraisal by the Beijing JZSC Intellectual Property Forensic Center into files in BYD's possession which were alleged to belong to Foxconn.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Eventuallyʷʰᵉⁿ? the Shenzhen court made the final judgment: BYD's files contained non-public information originating from Foxconn, which could bring economic benefits to the holders, thereby, BYD was found guilty of infringing Foxconn's trade secrets.ᵃᵈᵈⁱᵗⁱᵒⁿᵃˡ ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ(ˢ) ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Afterwards, Foxconn withdrew the civil proceedings against BYD in mainland China, and sought criminal prosecution instead.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On 20 March 2008, the former executive director and Vice President of BYD was arrested.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Then on 24 and 31 March 2008 two former employees of Foxconn were arrested and sentenced to 1 year and 4 months, and 4 years in prison respectively.ᵃᵈᵈⁱᵗⁱᵒⁿᵃˡ ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ(ˢ) ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

BYD issued a counterclaim to Foxconn in Hong Kong court, alleging defamation and bribery of Chinese officials as well as intimidation on Foxconn's part.
