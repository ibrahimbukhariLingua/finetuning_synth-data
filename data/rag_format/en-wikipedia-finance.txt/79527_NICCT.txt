# NICCT



The **Netherlands India Chamber of Commerce & Trade (NICCT)** is a non-commercial, voluntary association of business concerns and professionals with an interest in business and economic relations between India and The Netherlands. It came into being in 2003 as a result of the merger between the India Trade Council and the Indo Dutch Chamber of Commerce, both of which had functioned in The Netherlands for many years and had similar objectives & activities.

The basic objective of the NICCT is to promote business and economic relations between India and The Netherlands to the mutual benefit of both the countries. The economies of the two countries are mutually complementary in many ways and there is a significant scope for expansion of trade and business relations between these two countries. Knowledge and understanding of business environments in the two countries is a prerequisite for expanding business relationship between them. The NICCT endeavours to play a significant role in expanding this knowledge and in creating favourable climate for further improvement of business relations between these countries.

The membership of the NICCT is growing rapidly. Currently more than 100 Dutch companies including major banks, insurance companies, IT related companies and multinationals are members of the NICCT and are participating actively in its activities.


## Objectives

The primary objective of the NICCT is to promote business and economic relations between India and The Netherlands to the mutual benefit of both countries. The economies of both countries are mutually complementary in many ways and there is a significant scope for expansions of trade and business relations.

Knowledge and understanding of both countries’ business environments is a prerequisite for expanding business relationships between them. The NICCT endeavours to play a significant role in expanding this knowledge and creating a favourable climate for further improvement of business relations between these two countries.

To achieve these objectives, the NICCT serves as a focal point for contacts and information concerning Indo-Dutch trade and business relations, whereby it aims to represent, promote, and protect the common interest of its members. The NICCT also strives towards progressive liberalisation, reduction, and eventual elimination of tariffs & restrictions on trade between both countries.

As such, the NICCT provides an active platform, initiating many opportunities for networking on economic relations between India & the Netherlands.


## Activities

The NICCT is a very dynamic binational chamber of commerce in The Netherlands. It organizes many kinds of activities to promote business and economic relations between India and The Netherlands. Its activities include match making trade missions to India, receiving trade delegations from India, seminars and net working receptions.
