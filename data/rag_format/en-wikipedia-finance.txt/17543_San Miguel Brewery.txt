## History

The first San Miguel Brewery, Inc. was founded as **La Fábrica de Cerveza San Miguel** in 1890 by Enrique María Barreto under a Spanish Royal Charter that officially permitted the brewing of beer in the Philippines. Barretto was soon joined by Pedro Pablo Roxas as managing partner, who brought with him a German brewmaster, Ludwig Kiene, as technical director. The business incorporated as San Miguel Brewery, Inc. in 1913. The company was renamed San Miguel Corporation (SMC) in 1963, having grown into one of the Philippines' largest business conglomerates with core interests in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, food, and packaging. The breweries operated as the beer division of San Miguel Corporation until 2007.

The present San Miguel Brewery, Inc. was incorporated on July 26, 2007 as a subsidiary of SMC. The domestic beer business of SMC was spun off into San Miguel Brewery, Inc. on October 1, 2007. In 2009, Kirin Holdings Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired 48.3% of San Miguel Brewery, Inc. from SMC for PHP 8.841 per share.

In 2010, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. acquired 100% ownership of San Miguel Brewing International Ltd, enabling San Miguel Brewery, Inc. to achieve full integration of its domestic and international beer businesses. San Miguel Brewing International oversees operations in Hong Kong (San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong), People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.

San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. willⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ acquire 7.86 billion shares in San Miguel Brewery, Inc. from SMC. As a result, San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. will own 51% of San Miguel Brewery, Inc.
