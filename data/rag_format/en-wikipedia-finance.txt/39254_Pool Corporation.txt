## History

Pool Corporation was founded in 1980 as South Central Pool Supply by Frank J. St. Romain.

In 1993, the company was purchased by Code Hennessey's & Simmons. In 1995, the company was renamed SCP Pool Corporation and became a public company via an initial public offering. The company was renamed Pool Corporation on May 16, 2006.

In 1999, the company acquired Benson Pump Company, Pratts Plastics Limited, certain assets of Garden Leisure Products, and Jean Albouy, S.A. for a total of $25.5 million.

The company's business improved significantly during the COVID-19 lockdowns due to an increase in pool construction. However, sales slowed when the lockdowns ended.

In 2021, the company acquired Porpoise Pool & Patio, the largest franchisor of pool and outdoor living stores in the U.S.


## Controversies

In 2011, the company was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of antitrust practices by pressuring its suppliers to not conduct business with its competitors. In January 2012, the company settled with a consent order which prohibited the company from continuing the practice.
