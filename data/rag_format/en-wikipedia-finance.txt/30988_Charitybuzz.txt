## History

Coppy Holzman founded Charitybuzz out of his Westport, Connecticut, home in April 2005 with partners Serena Chew and Brad Reisner. After a conversation with Chevy Chase and President Bill Clinton at a reception to benefit the Clinton Library in late 2004. They launched Charitybuzz a few months later with one employee and a directive from Chase to raise funds for The Center for Environmental Education. Holzman and his team persuaded 70 celebrities and luxury brands into donating meet-and-greets, VIP tickets, vacations and other gifts for the company's first auction. The first experience auctioned was a Caddyshack golf outing with Bill Murray and Chase. After a segment with Chase on the TODAY show, the online auction site raised $250,000 within two weeks. After its initial success, Charitybuzz's business grew quickly through word of mouth.

Holzman ran Charitybuzz part-time until the fall of 2007, when he committed to operating the business full-time and moved the company out of his home and into an office space. In 2008, he registered Charitybuzz as a sub-chapter S in Delaware.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
