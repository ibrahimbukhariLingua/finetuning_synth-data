Following the 2008–2009 political negotiations, a power sharing agreement was made between ZANU-PF led by then President Robert Mugabe and the MDC-T led by Tsvangirai. This was due to the former losing their majority in the House of Assembly. Under the agreement Tsvangirai became Prime Minister and members of his party were included in Mugabe's cabinet.
