## Company history

In 1934, Josef Rethmann laid the foundation for the family business by taking over a railway freight forwarder and a haulage company that also was responsible for ash disposal for some households in Selm. After winning a tender, this contract was extended to cover the entire town in 1959 — thus laying the foundations for the Remondis Group.

In 1961, Norbert Rethmann (born in 1939) took over the management of the family business. In 1992, Norbert Rethmann transferred almost all his shares in the company to his four sons and became chairman of the supervisory board. Hermann Niehues, who had been with the company since 1978, became CEO. In 1998, the Group's logistics division was further expanded with the acquisition of Rhenus AG & Co. When he took over, the turnover was 800 million Deutsche Mark. In 2007, the Rethmann Group achieved consolidated sales of €7.2 billion.

Following Niehues' fatal accident in the summer of 2008, Reinhard Lohmann, a graduate in business administration, took over as CEO on October 1, 2008. The brothers Ludger and Klemens Rethmann completed the three-member Board of Management.

In 2010, Rethmann participated in the bidding process for Steag, Germany's fifth-largest energy supplier, but lost out to a municipal holding company of several municipal utilities from the Ruhr region in Germany.

In January 2019, Rethmann acquired a 30% stake in the international transport group Transdev from Veolia. The stake was increased to 34% with the contribution of an additional 4% by Rhenus Veniro. Rethmann's former transport subsidiary, Rhenus Veniro, thus became part of Transdev.
