In the summer of 2000, then President of Panathinaikos, Yiorgos Vardinoyannis stepped down and sold his share to Yannis Vardinoyannis. The latter changed the style of management into the club, while he continued working with the companies controlled by the family. In 2005, he was one of the founding members of the Greek Super League and elected president in 2007, being credited for his efforts to achieve European league standards in Greece. He stepped down in 2008. On 22 April 2008, he announced the decision of the Vardinoyannis family to reduce their share in Panathinaikos Football Club to 50% – after 30 years of full ownership – through an €80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the family would hold 56% of the club, Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos 10% and the rest of the shareholders 34%. The family finally withdrew from Panathinaikos in 2012. Under the chairmanship of Yannis Vardinoyannis, Panathinaikos F.C. reached the quarter-finals in Champions League in 2001–2002 and the quarter-finals in UEFA Cup in 2002–2003.
