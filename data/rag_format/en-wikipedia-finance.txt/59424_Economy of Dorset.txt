## History

Historically, agriculture has dominated the Dorset economy, but over time it has decreased in importance. Dorset was the birthplace of the trade union movement, with the Tolpuddle Martyrs hailing from the county.

Being a coastal county, smuggling has been a dominant part of the Dorset economy with the Battle of Mudeford being fought in 1784 at Mudeford Quay, Mudeford, Christchurch. Fleet and Kinson were also home to smugglers.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom has damaged the economy heavily.
