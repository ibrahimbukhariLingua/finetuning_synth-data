## Purpose

Though the law and economics movement has continental foundations as well as roots in American jurisprudence, over the past fifteen years the field has grown to be dominated by the Chicago law and economics school. Despite the dominance of the Chicago approach, international scholars have made vast contributions to the field, and to the broader themes of legal theory surrounding law and economics. The purpose of the CLEI Center and its IEL (Institutions, Economics, Law) Ph.D. program is to foster an alternative approach to the comparative analysis of law and economics. To further this mission, the CLEI Centre and the Collegio Carlo Alberto attract highly qualified economists and legal theorists from around the world to introduce students to alternative traditions in the law and economics movement.

The CLEI Centre also sponsors scholarship focusing on empirical analysis of law.


## CLEI/IEL Program

The centerpiece of CLEI is a three-year Ph.D. program. The program is administered by the University of Turin, graduate division. The CLEI Center also offers a one-year Master's program in Institutions, Economics and Law. The coordinator of the program is Prof. Giovanni B. Ramello.

The Center sponsors conferences, visiting lecturers, and various other keynote addresses.

Speakers at CLEI have included Guido Calabresi, Duncan Kennedy and Ugo Mattei.


## Location

The CLEI centre is located in the city of Moncalieri, (a suburb of the province of Torino) within the historic Collegio Carlo Alberto.
