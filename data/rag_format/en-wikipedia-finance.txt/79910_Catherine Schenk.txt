## Research

Professor Schenk's research focuses the economic history of post war Britain. Her work focuses extensively on the decline of the British Empire, its currency and economy. Her first two books focused on the declining role of sterling in the global economy: *Britain and the Sterling Area: from Devaluation to Convertibility in the 1950s* and *The decline of sterling: managing the retreat of an international currency, 1945â€“1992*. The first takes the perspective of the sterling area while the second book focuses more broadly on the political and economic context in Britain.
