The company Tri-Tech was founded in 1984 by Rune Westergård and Rolf Berg within the field of mechanical engineering.

During the first few years the company was a small engineering firm. In the early 1990s, a more rapid expansion phase began. Simultaneously as new lines of business emerged: environmental consultancy and technical documentation. These lines of business became two separate corporations in 1993 (Citec Environmental) and 2001 (Citec Information). In 2008, Citec Environmental became part of Citec Engineering Oy Ab.

In 2011 both companies - Citec Engineering Oy Ab and Citec Information Oy Ab – were consolidated into one group; Citec Oy Ab. A fund managed by Sentica Partners entered as the new majority shareholder with a 67 percent share and Martin Strand was appointed CEO as of June 1, 2011.

In 2022, the Indian company Cyient purchased all of the shares of Citec for €94 million (equivalent to €99 million or US$107 million in 2023).
