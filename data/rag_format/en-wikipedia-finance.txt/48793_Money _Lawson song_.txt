# Money (Lawson song)



"**Money**" is the ninth single by British pop rock band Lawson. The single was released as the third single (first excl. *Lawson EP*) from their upcoming second album *Perspective*, set to release on 8 July 2016. The music video for "**Money**" was released on 4 February 2016. The single was released on 18 March 2016, via Polydor Records. "The song "**Money**" was written in a time when the band had none." - It was revealed that Lawson wrote the song years before whilst touring in a van, struggling to find gigs. The song is said to be revamped for 2016.


## Music video

The music video for "Money" was directed by Carly Cussen. The video shows the foursome rocking it out in a pillared room and then having fun and performing in a party with guests.


## Sound

"Money" differs in sound to the rest of the material previously unveiled (as Lawson EP) from their upcoming album. The new single features a hint of reggae in addition to their pop rock sound, similar to "Juliet".


## Development

Lead singer Andy Brown said about the single:

> We first had the idea of Money when we were unsigned and touring around in an old van, absolutely skint. We used to sing 'Whereâ€™s the money?!' after driving 100s of miles to play to 10 people!
> 
> After the success of the first album, we developed it further and it just turned into this big, pop anthem. It's going to be a big favourite in the live set- we shot the video last week and invited a bunch of our friends and fans down to be in it and they were all singing along after the first listen.


## Critical reception

Lewis Corner of Digital Spy said this about their new single:

> British pop-rockers Lawson are back with a big new track ahead of the release of their second studio album.
> 
> The four-piece will officially release 'Money' as their new single on March 18, but it's available to stream on Spotify and Apple Music now.
> 
> And they're crooning about something we can all relate to - being skint.
