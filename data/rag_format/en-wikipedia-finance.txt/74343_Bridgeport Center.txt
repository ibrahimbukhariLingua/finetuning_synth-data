Bridgeport Center


# Bridgeport Center



**Bridgeport Center** (also known as the **People's Bank Building**) is a continuous complex of low to mid-rise office buildings in downtown Bridgeport, Connecticut. The complex served as the headquarters of People's United Financial, now a subsidiary of M&T Bank. It is to serve as the regional headquarters of M&T Bank in New England. It was designed by Richard Meier & Partners Architects LLP and finished construction in 1989. The complex was built in part of efforts to revitalize the city's Downtown. Perhaps best known for its central tower, this 18-story postmodern style building, at 248 feet (76 m) tall, is the tallest building in Bridgeport. It is adjacent to the Barnum Museum.

The building is located at 850 Main Street on the site of the First National Bank Building, which shared the same address.

Law firm Pullman & Comley LLC also has space in the complex.


## Design

Bridgeport Center has a gross total of 304,500 sq ft (28,290 m²) of interior space. The form of the building consists of a continuous fabric of low to mid-rise office buildings. A seven-story parking garage resides on the eastern portion of the building's base, with access to the lobby atrium and elevators. The ground floor also houses a People's United Financial branch.


### Tower

An 18-story tower rises from the complex, clad with steel and granite facades. The southern face of the tower is primarily made of granite and is in the shape of a rectangular prism, with a 1x2x2 grid shape of thick granite pillars forming the tower's distinguishing roof piece. To the north of the granite portion of the tower, a wider white portion holds most of the tower's area. On the west face, this part of the building has a central curve inward. The roof of this portion contains two mechanical penthouses that are stacked on top of each other, each having a greater setback than the last.
