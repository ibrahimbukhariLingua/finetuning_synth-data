Altura Credit Union


# Altura Credit Union



**Altura Credit Union** (Altura) is the largest credit union headquartered in Riverside County, California, with over 175,000 members and assets in excess of $2 billion, as of December 2022. It is a federally insured, state-chartered financial institution, offering financial products and services that include checking and savings accounts, commercial and residential mortgage loans, and wealth management services. It also belongs to the CO-OP Financial Services and CU Service Centers interbank networks.


## Institutional History

Altura was originally founded in 1957 as Riverside Schools Credit Union in order to serve the banking and financial needs of county school district employees. In 1998, it merged with Riverside County Federal Credit Union, which served both private and public sector employees in Riverside County, and was re-named Riverside County's Credit Union.

In 2004, after expanding its field of membership to include Riverside County, San Diego County, and select cities in Orange County and San Bernardino County, Riverside County's Credit Union was renamed Altura Credit Union, and was also accompanied by the adoption of a new corporate logo and brand identity.


## Merger with Visterra Credit Union

In 2015, Altura and Visterra Credit Union (Visterra), which was also based in Riverside County, announced a merger between the two financial institutions. The development reflected a mutual desire to better serve the needs of their combined members. The merger, which was finalized on August 1, 2015, created a $1.1 billion credit union with 118,000 Members. At the time that the merger was announced, Altura managed $757.3 million in assets and served nearly 84,000 Members, while Visterra managed $335.6 million in assets and served approximately 34,000 Members. The merged institutions retained the Altura name. On March 1, 2016, Altura completed the final phase of the merger process - the conversion and integration of their respective core systems.


## Membership

Altura's field of membership is set by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Membership in Altura is open to anyone who lives, works, worships or attends school in Riverside County, San Diego County, and select cities in Orange County and San Bernardino County. Following its merger with Visterra, Altura's field of membership expanded further to include U.S. military, government and civilian employees of the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, and retirees of the U.S. Armed Forces.


## Branch Locations

Altura Credit Union operates 19 full-service branch locations and 52 Altura-branded ATM in Riverside County. Altura members also have access to over 5,200 shared branching locations and 30,000 ATMs nationwide.


## Auto Expert

Altura operates a subsidiary company, Auto Expert. Auto Expert is an auto locating and buying service that assists Altura's members (as well as members of 11 partner credit unions) in finding and purchasing their next pre-owned or new vehicle. In 2007, Auto Expert received the California Award for Performance Excellence (CAPE) Gold Award. This award is the California equivalent of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
