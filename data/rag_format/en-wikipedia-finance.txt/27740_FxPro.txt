## History

FxPro was founded in 2002 as a foreign exchange broker EuroOrient Securities & Financial Services Ltd in Cyprus. The company is headquartered in London and has offices in Cyprus, Monaco, and the Bahamas. In 2010, FxPro was granted regulation and licensing by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (Financial Services Authority at the time) and opened its London office.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In June 2010, the company announced a sponsorship agreement with the football club Fulham F.C. for three years, as well as a three-year sponsorship agreement with the football club Aston Villa.

The company opened an office in Australia in 2011, but it closed this in March 2013 and moved these clients to Cyprus and UK operations after new capital regulations came into force in Australia.

In 2013, FxPro launched the Super Trader platform, which specializes in social trading. At the time of its launch, Super Trader featured about 200 forex traders, whose positions can be copied by other FxPro traders. Traders are picked and vetted by FxPro, based on factors such as their trading techniques, how profitable they have been, and how risky their trades were.

FxPro began its initial public offering (IPO) in 2015. However, one year later, in 2016, the company postponed its plans due to turmoil in global markets.

In spring 2017, the plans were postponed again due to the new tough FCA measures.

FxPro entered a multi-year partnership with the McLaren F1 team in 2018. FxPro was also featured on the McLaren MCL33 used in the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix.

In April 2022, FxPro opened an office in Dubai to support customers in the MENA region.

FxPro account types include MT4, MT5, cTrader, and FxPro Edge.

In June 2023, FxPro introduced cryptocurrency trading to its cTrader accounts, allowing traders to log in to their cTrader accounts and open new accounts under their profiles. Some of the tokens currently supported on the platform are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.

The company also grew its cash reserves from £2.6 million in 2022 to £3.6 million in 2023, expanding the total assets excluding liabilities by 4%.
