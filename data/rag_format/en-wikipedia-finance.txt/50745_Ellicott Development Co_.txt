## History

Ellicott Development Co. was founded by lawyer and real estate developer Carl Paladino in 1973. The company is named after the Ellicott Square Building, Paladino's first and largest real estate acquisition to date. The Ellicott Square Building was named after Joseph Ellicott, the planner and surveyor who laid out the then-village of Buffalo.

The company buys properties, builds stores, and leases them to national retail outlets and government agencies. The company has operations in Western New York, Central New York and portions of Pennsylvania. Ellicott Development Co. describes itself as "a multi-faceted, fully integrated Property Management, Leasing and Development Firm with the "In-House" capacity to provide legal, administrative, financial, management, accounting, development, site selection, site assemblage, architectural design and drafting services, construction, leasing, maintenance, janitorial and security services."

Ellicott Development Co. has properties throughout the Buffalo/Niagara region, Upstate New York and into Western Pennsylvania. In 2010, the company managed more than 5,000,000 square feet (460,000 m²) of office, retail, hotel and residential space. In downtown Buffalo, the company manages over 1,500,000 square feet (140,000 m²) of office space (making Ellicott the largest private landlord in downtown Buffalo), over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m²) of retail space throughout New York and Western Pennsylvania, eight major hotels in the Western New York, as well as more than 550,000 square feet (51,000 m²) of residential apartments, condominiums and townhomes in the Buffalo/Niagara region.
