## History

In 2005, Strathmore University entered into a partnership with IESE Business School, creating Strathmore University Business School.

The new business school started its first program on 11 January 2006 with Dr George Njenga as the dean, offering the Advanced Management Program. Its MBA for Executives program was launched in 2007.

It operated from office space in the university's library, conducting classes in the conference facilities of hotels in Nairobi.

In 2009, construction began at the site of a new campus, at which it started operating in 2012. The building was designed to have a very low carbon footprint, receiving an award, in 2012, for being the Best Green Building Development in Africa.
