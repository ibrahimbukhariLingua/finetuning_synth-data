Zealand Academy of Technologies and Business


# Zealand Academy of Technologies and Business



**Zealand Institute of Technologies and Business** (Danish: Sjællands Erhvervsakademi, EASJ) or **Zealand** is a school of higher education established in 2008 due to a merger of nine Danish Colleges, most dating back more than 100 years. It is regularly ranked within the top 4 business academies in Denmark and is currently ranked first in the Køge Municipality. Zealand operates six campuses in Region Zealand to the west and south of Copenhagen, Denmark. The campuses, with a total of some 3,200 students, are located in Næstved, Roskilde, Køge, Slagelse, Holbæk and Nykøbing Falster. The school is an independent self-owning institution subordinated to the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education. Degree programs offered are mainly applied degrees, especially in technology, IT, and business. The academy grants undergraduate and academic degrees but not master's or doctoral degrees. In addition to full-time studies, the academy offers supplemental education, part-time programs at bachelor's level, and short-term courses for people who need to strengthen their qualifications.


## History

The Zealand Institute of Technologies and Business was founded in 2008 and initially offered higher education programs in cooperation with nine different vocational schools in Region Zealand. As of August 2012, these higher education programs were officially transferred from the nine schools to the administration of Zealand. The number of students has almost doubled since then
