Students have access to JSTOR and EBSCOHOST subscription scholarly archives. By arrangement, students of economic programs that have a grade "B" or higher at the end of the study, may also hold a degree from the University of Houston (USA), in addition to the KSE Diploma.

The best students on the rating have significant benefits in terms of tuition fees and the ability to become "teacher assistant" in the second year of study.

The members of the board meet every year and have separate discussions on successes and challenges in the KSE development.

The head of IAB is also the member of the board of directors. One of the members of IAB is Roger Myerson.

### Ukraine Humanitarian Relief Campaign by KSE

From the very beginning of the war, KSE launched an international fundraising campaign aimed at Ukraine humanitarian relief.

The KSETeam collects contributions, purchases, and coordinates all logistics for the delivery of first aid kits and protective kits. Individuals and business all over the world support the campaign. Substantial donations made such companies as Jefferies, Ripple, PUMB, Kernel, УкрНафтоБуріння, U.COMMODITIES.

**The campaign covers the following streams:**

* Medical supplies (primarily, ambulance kits with stop-bleed items)
* Protective kits
* Food and water for civilians

**As of March 21, 2022, KSE has already raised more than $11.8 million for:**

* 15400 first aid kits and prepay 20000 more
* 25000 tourniquets,
* 6350 safety vests,
* 3000 plates for locally produced vests and have available funding to secure additional 5000+,
* 5140 helmets,
* other supplies (e.g. fabric for vests production, food supplies for cities under shelling).

Among 18 batches in total, 6 are already delivered to Ukraine, 6 are on the way, 3 are being compiled for delivery and 3 have issues or had to be cancelled. Batches with issues are being resolved with the involvement of embassies when needed.

KSE is committed to continue supporting Ukraine with supplying the critical supplies to those.

First batches with 5000 of aid kits are already going to Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv. 500 completed bulletproof vests have already been delivered to Kharkiv. These bulletproof vests have plates of the 4th highest class. Also, the fund has already purchased an additional nearly 5,000 bulletproof vests to arrive in Ukraine next week.

Current demand for medical kits in Ukraine is 307,000 units. KSE procurement team follows closely the specifications of the benchmark kit, provided by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, which is used by the Ukrainian armed forces in their emergency training. KSE is also working in close cooperation to get approval from the Ministry of Health on any deviations and analogues provided by suppliers.

As of March 20, KSE has already procured and delivered 5,400 medical kits at the total price of ca. USD 290,000. Additionally, 30,000 units of medical kits with improved specifications have been ordered and prepaid at the total price of ca. USD 2.2 million. These quantities are planned to be delivered to Ukraine in batches over the next couple of weeks. In addition, further volumes of 50,000 more units have been discussed with KSE's suppliers and are currently in the negotiations stage.


### Military economy

During the war KSE supports the Ukrainian government. KSE analysts assess the losses the effect of sanctions against Russia and develop economic post-war recovery scenarios.

Together with the Office of the President of Ukraine and the Ministry of Economy, KSE launched the Russia Will Pay project. Its purpose is to gather information about objects that have been destroyed and continue to be destroyed as a result of the war. This information will be used by the Ukrainian government as evidence in international courts to compensate Ukraine for the damage.

The database was compiled jointly with Ukrainian IT volunteers. It is presented as "the most complete and actual list of top companies and world-famous brands that have closed their business in Russia or continue to work in this market". As of August 2023, the database lists over 3,400 companies of which over 1,410 are listed as continuing operation in Russia and over 758 as either having withdrawn or completely exited Russia.
