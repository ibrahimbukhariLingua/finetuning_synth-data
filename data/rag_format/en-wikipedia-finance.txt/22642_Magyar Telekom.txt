# Magyar Telekom



**Magyar Telekom Nyrt.** (officially *Magyar Telekom Távközlési Nyilvánosan Működő Részvénytársaság, Magyar Telekom Telecommunications Public Limited Company* lit. 'Hungarian Telecom Telecommunications Public Limited Company') is one of the leading Hungarian telecommunications service provider company. It is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.

Magyar Telekom provides a full range of telecommunications and information communication (ICT) services to private individuals as well as small, medium and large corporate customers, including landline and mobile phone, data transfer and non-voice based, as well as IT and system integration services uniformly under the Telekom brand. Magyar Telekom is connected to the lives of its customers by millions of threads, telephone, internet, TV and IT: it has a high-quality, reliable and uniquely wide range of services in all areas. Magyar Telekom Nyrt. is the 100% owner of Telekom Regszerintegració Zrt., as well as the majority owner of Makedonski Telekom, the leading integrated service provider in North Macedonia.

Until 6 May 2005, it was known as Matáv (*Magyar Távközlési Rt.* – Hungarian Telecommunications PLC). The company was formed under the name of *Magyar Távközlési Vállalat* (Hungarian Telecommunications Enterprise) in December 1989, when *Magyar Posta* (Hungarian Post) was split into three separate enterprises. On 31 December 1991, the company was re-structured as a public limited company as *Magyar Távközlési Rt..* On 1 July 1993, the Telecommunications Act came into effect, making it possible to privatize the company. The company remained 100% state owned until the end of 1993. At this point, a consortium was formed between Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, which was named MagyarCom. MagyarCom bought a company share of 30.1% for a price of US$875 million.


## History


### Early years

On 31 December 1989, after becoming one of the three sections of the Hungarian Post service area, the Hungarian Telecommunications Company (Matáv) was founded, as telecommunications operator Magyar Telecom Rt. The company was wholly owned by the state until the end of 1993, but became privatized after the Telecommunications Act came into effect 1 July 1993. In 1993, 30.1% ownership of Matáv was purchased by Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech International telecommunications companies, under the new name, MagyarCom Consortium. During the privatization process MagyarCom acquired a majority stake of the company, under a contract signed on 22 December 1995. The effect of the two companies forming a consortium was Central and Eastern Europe's largest privatization, and also the largest foreign investment in Hungary.


### Deutsche Telekom's majority

On 14 November 1997, Matáv share trading began in Budapest and New York City, placing 26.31% of the shares on the market, which was the largest share subscription ever held in Hungary, making Matáv the first Central European company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In the summer of 1999, ÁPV Rt. (Hungary's State Privatization Property Agency) sold the last package of shares of Hungary's 5.75%, but still held the golden share.

On 3 July 2000, Deutsche Telekom acquired SBC's 50% stake in MagyarCom in compliance of their shareholder agreement. As a result of the change in the ownership structure of MagyarCom, Deutsche Telekom's ownership in Matáv increased to 59.52%, the remaining 40.48% public shareholding, while the golden share was owned by Hungary.


### Internationalization

Since 2001, it was possible for Matáv to become an international telecommunications group. The consortium led by Matáv acquired a majority stake in Macedonia's national telecommunications company Makedonski Telekomunikacii (MakTel), which became a consolidated subsidiary of the group. As a further step, Matáv acquired the remaining 50% stake in Emitel Rt.

The group's companies took leading positions in the mobile phone, internet and business data communications markets, with a share of over 80% in the fixed phone market.

A new governance structure of the group was adopted at the end of 2001.


### Rebranding

In 2002, the Matáv Group obtained group-level certification in accordance with ISO 9001:2000, certified by SGS S.A.

Matáv also wanted to lead telecommunications and Internet services in Hungary, as evidenced by the 100,000th ADSL subscription acquired in December 2003. In mobile telephones, number portability was a minor difficulty, but the Westel division of the group solved the problem in 2004.

In March 2004, the group decided to replace the Westel name, which had existed since 1989, and joined the global T-Mobile brand on 1 May 2004. Subsequently, the Matáv Group decided to consolidate and merge, subordinating the structure of the group of companies on 1 January 2005, and then on 6 May all its services and operational organizations under central management and the group of companies. It changed its company name, and from that date, the Magyar Telekom Group operated as a group of "T" brand names.

On 8 November 2005, Magyar Telekom purchased Orbitel (Bulgaria's telecommunications provider), a transaction that ended on 3 February 2006.

The merge caused T-Mobile Magyarország Rt. and Magyar Telekom Rt. to stop existing, and András Sugár, CEO of T-Mobile, resigned. At the same time, *Magyar Telekom Távközlési Nyilvánosan Működő Részvénytársaság* took over their role on 1 March 2006.
