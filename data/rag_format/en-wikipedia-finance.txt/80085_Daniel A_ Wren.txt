## Work


### *Most Influential Management Books of the 20th century,* 2001

At the turn of the century several authors started reflection on 20th century management. Studies were made by Arthur G. Bedeian and Wren (2001), looking back at books on management, and by Stuart Crainer and Des Dearlove (2002) looking back at the most influential management thinkers of the 20th century. In the 2001 article in *Organizational Dynamics* Bedeian and Wren gave a listing of the twenty-five most influential management books. The authors were selected publications based on the impact they had in their time on management thinking, and on the impact they had in the management discipline as a whole. Together with a panel of consultants a first listing was developed, which was further compiled based on a poll of the fellow members of the Academy of Management.

The first ten books in their final listing:

* Frederick Winslow Taylor (1911), *The Principles of Scientific Management.*
* Chester I. Barnard (1938), *The Functions of the Executive.*
* Peter F. Drucker (1954), *The practice of Management.*
* Douglas McGregor (1960), *The Human Side of Enterprise.*
* Herbert A. Simon (1947), *Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-making Processes in Administrative Organization.* With a Foreword by Chester I. Barnard
* Paul R. Lawrence and Jay W. Lorsch (1967), *Organization and environment: Managing differentiation and integration.*
* James G. March and Herbert A. Simon (1958), *Organizations.*
* Abraham H. Maslow (1954), *Motivation and Personality.*
* Michael E. Porter (1980), *Competitive strategy: Techniques for analyzing industries and competitors.*
* Fritz J. Roethlisberger and William J. Dickson (1939), *Management and the Worker.*

About their first choice: They further explained that, "Although Taylor remains the favorite bogeyman of the popular press, the fundamental principle of Taylor's philosophy - the rule of knowledge as opposed to tradition and personal opinion - is as valid today as it was in its time."
