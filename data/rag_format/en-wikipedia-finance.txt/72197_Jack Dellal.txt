**Jack Dellal** (2 October 1923 – 28 October 2012) was a British property investor, nicknamed "Black Jack". His company, the property group Allied Commercial Holdings, financed the purchase of Shell Mex House in 2002 and sold it in 2007. Dellal had a net worth of £4.6 billion, making him one of the richest men in England during his time.


## Early life

Dellal was born in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, to Iraqi-born Sephardic Jewish immigrants Sulman Dellal, a textile importer and Charlotte Shashoua. He was educated at Heaton Moor College, also in Manchester. Dellal worked with his father from the early age of 14, selling cloth.


## Career

Dellal became a banker in the 1970s. He owned the Dalton Barton London fringe bank, which he sold to Keyser Ullman for £58 million. He set up Allied Commercial in 1974 with Stanley Van Gelder, with whom he worked for over forty years. One of their deals was the flip of central London's Bush House in 2004, which made £75.0 million within two years. He was said to have invested up to £200m in London's Dolphin Square.

Dellal's nickname, "Black Jack", was popularly said to have derived from his love of gambling.
