## Acquisitions


### in Kosovo

After much controversy, Alferon Management acquired in 2006 Ferronikeli Complex LLC, a nickel plant in Drenas Kosovo. The controversy behind the acquisition stemmed from Alferon receiving the approval on the acquisition from the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) despite the fact that they were not the highest bidder; US- Albanian company, Adi Nickel was the highest bidder offering 49.5 million Euros.

Ferki Karaxha, the head of Ferronikeli trade union, stated that since Adi-Nickel won the first tender, it was no fair to declare IMR a provisional winner.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ. He also stated that he "has always been against the sale of the company and is convinced that the sale is a great crime against the national economy".

The sale agreement also includes an investment commitment from IMR-Alferon of €20 million, plus a guarantee to employ at least 1,000 people at Ferronikeli.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Deputy Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General (DSRSG), Joachim Ruecker, said the sale sent “a very strong signal to international investors”. Mr Ruecker added: “Kosovo is a stable and mature society, which welcomes international investment.”
