It also operates the diffusion line Marc New York.


## Dog fur controversy

In 2007, The Humane Society of the United States reported that some Andrew Marc coats labelled as having fake fur were in fact trimmed with fur from Chinese domestic dogs.

In 2008, the Humane Society filed a lawsuit claiming that Andrew Marc labeled real fur as fake fur, or labeled raccoon dog fur as common raccoon, fox or rabbit fur.

In 2009, through a court settlement with the Humane Society, Andrew Marc agreed to phase out raccoon dog fur usage by 2013 and improve its garment labeling practices.

In 2015, having failed to phase out raccoon dog fur usage by 2013, Andrew Marc settled a civil contempt lawsuit with the Humane Society. Andrew Marc was required to certify that it will never again sell raccoon dog fur, and to pay $25,000 to the Humane Society.
