LightStream


# LightStream



**LightStream** is an American online lender that is a division of Truist Bank. Truist was formed in December 2019, as the result of a â€œmerger of equals" between SunTrust Bank (of which LightStream was a division) and BB&T.

Debuting in March 2013, LightStream is a financial services technology company that provides unsecured, personal loans to people with good credit rating, through a digital process.

On April 20, Truist announced that it will fold LightStream into its broader consumer business, a move designed to reduce the costs of operating a separate brand.

People applied online and when approved, quickly received a so-called "Blank Check" loan by mail. By 2003, PeopleFirst had grown to be the nation's largest online vehicle lender.

Launching in 2005, FirstAgain expanded its online financing to include purposes beyond vehicle loans, giving unsecured loans for practically any purpose to consumers with excellent credit. This has since been adopted by others in the fintech industry.
