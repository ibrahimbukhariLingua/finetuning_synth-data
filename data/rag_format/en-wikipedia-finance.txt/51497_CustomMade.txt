## Company History


### Beginnings

Co-founders Michael Salguero and Seth Rosen met as undergraduates at Boston University. Both had an interest in custom-made shirts, belts, and pants. After working in real estate, they changed careers. In January 2009, Salguero and Rosen bought the custommade.com URL for $140,000 from a woodworker who had owned and run the site since 1996.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ At the time of the purchase, the site hosted around 350 makers paying a small subscription fee to be on the site. The site was generating about $35,000 a year in subscription sales.
