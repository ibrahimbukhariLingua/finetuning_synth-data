# Adjusted current yield



The **adjusted current yield** is a financial term used in reference to bonds and other fixed-interest securities. It is closely related to the concept of current yield.

The adjusted current yield is given by the current yield with addition of
{\displaystyle {\frac {({\text{Face value}}-{\text{Clean price}})/{\text{Years to maturity}}}{\text{Clean price}}}\cdot 100\%.}

Here *Face value* is the face value of the bond, and *Clean price* is the clean price of the bond (i.e. present value of the bond with accrued interest subtracted).
