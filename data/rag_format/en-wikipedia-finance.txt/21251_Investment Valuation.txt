## Review

> For investors and students of the financial markets who want to embark on serious fundamental analysis, it is critical to understand how to go about valuing stocks and other instruments. There is no short cut. The person who runs a bunch of screens (low P/E, high growth, etc.) and thinks his output gives him an investing edge is deluding himself. Fundamental analysis involves hard work and an artful touch. Damodaran's Investment Valuation explains the hard work part.
