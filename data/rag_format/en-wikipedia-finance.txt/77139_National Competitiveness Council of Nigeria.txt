National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria


# National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria



The **National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria (NCCN)** is a private-public non-profit organisation in Nigeria. The council's mandate is to improve the attractiveness of Nigeria’s economy as a place to do business in the global marketplace.

The Council's operations are largely driven by the private sector, with government playing a supportive and enabling role. The Council serves as a nexus for the dialogue between business, trade unions, regulatory organisations, academia, international development organisations, think tanks, media and the Nigerian Government. The outcome of this dialogue is actionable recommendations and an implementation strategy for policies that will improve economic competitiveness and collective prosperity for Nigeria's citizens.


## History

The Council was inaugurated by His Excellency Goodluck E. Jonathan on 4 February 2013. Former bank executive Matthias Chika Mordi was appointed as the inaugural chief executive officer.


## Structure

The Council is chaired by the incumbent Minister of Trade and Investment. The position of vice-chair is held by an appointed private sector leader. The CEO heads the secretariat in charge of the council's executive and administrative tracks.

The hope is that these reports will focus discourse around competitiveness issues and provide a platform for policy changes that will result in increased competitiveness.
