## Reaction

As is tradition, the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Bridges, moved a motion of no confidence in reply to the Budget speech. Bridges claimed the Budget showed "a Government that is borrowing more, taxing more and spending more — but has no plans for how we as a country can earn more." In response, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern claimed the Opposition was "a lot of shouty shouty, and not a lot of planny planny."
