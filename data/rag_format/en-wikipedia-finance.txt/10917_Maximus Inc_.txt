The company is based in Tysons, Virginia, has 39,600 employees and a reported annual revenue of $5.3 billion in fiscal year 2024.


## History

Maximus was founded in 1975 by David V. Mastran, initially operating as a consulting firm for the federal government, including information technology services.

The history of Maximus follows the trajectory of significant government policy changes.

The government service reform policies in the '80s and early '90s which were enacted by the Reagan administration and continued in the Bush and Clinton administrations, led to the US government increasing private-sector contracting of administration program functions operated under the control of government. In 1988, Maximus was awarded its first contract for social welfare from Los Angeles County, and began shifting focus towards business process outsourcing and providing state-based consulting services.

Passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 under President Clinton granting states greater latitude in administering social welfare programs, and the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 amending certain eligibility, enrollment, and beneficiary protections in Medicaid further increased government use of public / private partnerships for the administration of certain program functions.

In 1997, the company went public, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MMS.

The G.W. Bush Administration saw reauthorization and expansion of PRWORA, cementing the government's use of private sector contracting of administrative functions associated with Federally funded, state administered, entitlement programs.

In 2006,Richard Montoni, former chief financial officer for Maximus, was named CEO. From 2008 to 2010, Maximus engaged in a number of divestitures that included its Security Solutions, Justice Solutions, Education Systems, Asset Solutions and Enterprise resource planning (ERP) divisions, focusing the firm on providing health and human services core program solutions.

Passage in 2010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) during the Obama Administration further expanded the use of private sector contracting of government administrative functions associated with the ACA, Medicaid, and Medicare, in conjunction with other human services related programs.

From 2010 to 2013, Maximus acquired Denver-based Policy Studies Incorporated (PSI) to increase its capacity to serve government clients in the US and expanded into clinical assessment services with the acquisition of Ascend. From a global perspective, Maximus acquired UK based Health Management Ltd. On April 6, 2015, the company completed the $300 million acquisition of Falls-Church-based technology contractor, Acentia, expanding the Maximus federal technology business.

In 2018, after twelve years as CEO, Richard Montoni announced his retirement and the company appointed President Bruce Caswell to the position of chief executive officer. Caswell articulated a strategic plan focusing the company's activities on helping governments advance digitally-enabled customer service, modernizing technology capabilities and expansion of clinical services delivery. In November 2018, Maximus acquired U.S. Federal citizen engagement center assets from another government contractor (GDIT) for $400 million in cash.

In September 2020, Maximus hired Dr. Arvenita Washington Cherry as Senior Director of DE&I to lead diversity and inclusion activities in its workforce.

In 2021, Maximus completed three additional transactions. Maximus and Navient announced the two companies signed a definitive agreement to transfer the loan servicing for 5.6 million U.S. Department of Education-owned student loan accounts through a contract novation, creating a new operating entity, Aidvantage. Maximus acquired Attain, a technology integration company, and Veterans Evaluation Services (VES), a clinical assessments company. In January 2025, the Department of Veterans Affairs re-awarded VES, a Maximus company, contracts through 2026 for domestic regions 1 – 4 which collectively span the continental U.S. to continue providing medical disability exams services through the Veterans Benefit Administration.

In May 2022, Maximus relocated its headquarters to Tysons, Virginia in new office space that was reported to incorporate "many of the post-pandemic office designs that architects and companies are emphasizing."

In September 2022, after a 3-year long competitive procurement process, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) awarded Maximus a 10 year contract that extended its existing role as lead operator of citizen contact centers, including 1-800-MEDICARE. In December 2023, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra announced it would be recompeting this contract for the express purpose of inserting a labor harmony agreement. In November 2024, CMS decided to halt efforts to rebid its contract with Maximus. Some observers, including 17 state attorneys general, noted that there was little precedent for ending an ongoing contract and introducing new labor harmony provisions. Sen. Bill Cassidy, the incoming chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, stated, 'The Maximus contract should never have ended in the first place,' and expressed concerns that the administration's actions were aimed at promoting unionization among call-center employees.

## Controversies

**November 1997**- The *Hartford Courant* reported that Maximus "gets minimal results" when it was hired by the State of Connecticut to manage a child care program for recipients of welfare. According to the Record-Journal, Maximus "hired too few people, installed an inadequate phone system and fell weeks or months behind in making payments to day care providers." The Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) asked Maximus to meet improvement goals and by December, DSS Commissioner Joyce A. Thomas noted improvements on several fronts commenting, "The good news for Connecticut's child care providers and the families we all serve is that the situation is rapidly improving. Maximus has come a long way, and we are confident that current efforts are paving the way to long-term improvements."

**December 1998**- The *Sarasota Herald Tribune* reported that the State of Florida had paid Maximus $4.5 Million for a Child Support Recovery contract. Maximus was only able to collect $162,000. "On average taxpayers paid Maximus $25 for every 3 cents collected."

**1999** - Then-mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani held his first meetings in May 1999 introducing the city's welfare reform programs which would require adult welfare recipients to either work or train for work. Mid-June was set as the deadline for the competition for the contracts. However, the Giuliani administration began to consult with Maximus executives on how the company could "reshape, consolidate and run" the programs, as early as January 1999. Starting in January, Maximus was awarded contracts worth $500 million, which represented the "largest share" to assess and train as many as 200,000 welfare recipients and to provide job placement. New York city's comptroller said that this gave Maximus an "unfair advantage".

**October 2000**- Six state lawmakers in Wisconsin called for the termination of Maximus' W-2 contract, saying the firm has "broken faith with the state and poor people the agency serves in Milwaukee County."

**June 2001**- The *Milwaukee Journal Sentinel* reported that two Maximus employees filed discrimination complaints against the company. The employees stated that Maximus is so lacking in diversity that the companies minority employees referred to it as "White Castle".

**2004** In 2004, British Columbia became the first province in Canada to outsource a large quantity of its health administration services—which included Medical Services Plan and PharmaCare—to the private sector, when BC Health signed the ten-year $324-million contract with Maximus. A campaign was launched in the province to protect private and personal health information. Concerns included the risk of disclosure of confidential date accessed under the Homeland Security Act.

**July 2007**- Maximus settled a lawsuit brought against it by the United States government for involvement in falsifying Medicaid claims for $30.5 million. Maximus did not admit or deny the government's allegations in the legal case.

**October 2010**- The *Los Angeles Times* reported that 146 medical workers, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists were allowed to keep working despite failing drug tests. Maximus was awarded a $2.5 Million a year contract to run California's confidential "diversion programs". Maximus contracted the work out to a subcontractor who in turn subcontracted the work to another company. The drug testing company was using the wrong standard of drug test from December 2009 to August 2010, resulting in medical workers who tested positive for drugs to continue working.

**June 2011**- A Maximus manager on the MassHealth project and had access to the personal information of enrollees in the MassHealth program, who had passed the Massachusetts-required CORI background check, was revealed to have pleaded no contest to a Florida felony by Boston-based Fox25. A subsequent review by Maximus found “no reason to believe that anyone’s personal information was used inappropriately” and terminated the employee.

**September 2011**- Maximus Inc. was sued by U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for disability discrimination for failure to promote a female employee because it regarded her as disabled. Maximus settled the lawsuit in August 2012.

**June 2012**- Through an internal privacy audit, Maximus discovered that a worker in Canada illegally viewed personal health records of 43 Canadians. The worker involved was immediately suspended and later fired.

**January 2013**- A Maximus employee based in Boston MA was indicted for allegedly stealing more than $490,000 from the Massachusetts Medicaid program. The theft had occurred over a period of nine years. She was convicted in December 2013.

**February 2013** In his February 2013 report, the British Columbia auditor general said that Maximus 10-year contract with BC Health lacked adequate monitoring and had not brought the "expected benefits" it had promised. Major deadlines were not met and no penalties were laid. Desktop and laptops were not replaced as often as agreed upon. Even after almost a decade, privacy issues had not been dealt with adequately. BC Health relies solely on the company to self-report breaches. Subcontractors were not given security audits. As well, auditing does not “provide assurance that data access and storage are limited to Canada and that the data can be segregated from the service provider’s parent companies.”¹⁷

**April 2021** An investigation by NPR and The Marshall Project found that many U.S. states were involved in the following practice, using Maximus as enabler and facilitator:

> "Social Security pays benefits to children who have significant disabilities, when their parents are disabled, or if a parent has died. When the check goes to a minor, someone is designated as the representative payee, trusted to use that money in the best interest of the child. States routinely take that money to cover the cost of foster care, even though there are already state and federal sources to pay for it and even though other impoverished children and youth who don't get Social Security checks aren't responsible for paying for their foster care."

Maximus was found to be among the consulting companies that were hired by states—including Alaska, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Maryland, and South Carolina—to locate foster children eligible to receive disability and other checks from Social Security and register them, for the sole purpose of generating revenue for the states. Even after these foster children aged out of the foster care program, they were not able to get the Social Security funds to which they were entitled. Law professor Daniel L. Hatcher criticized the practice in his book *The Poverty Industry.*

**March 2022** A report by the Student Borrower Protection Center and the Communications Workers of America noted consumer complaints filed against Aidvantage in relation to federal student loans, and accused Maximus, its parent company, of mismanagement.

In 2022 and 2023 Maximus workers were involved in actions to demonstrate against labor conditions and for improved pay, following employee layoffs.
