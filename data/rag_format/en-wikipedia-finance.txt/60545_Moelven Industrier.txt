## Products

Moelvens products and services are sold to customers in three main segments: the processing industry, retail and construction activities. Moelven is therefore organized according to these customer groups, and not according to processes. Moelvens three divisions are:

1. **Moelven Timber**, which produces industrial timber in the shape of dimensional timber and fabricated industrial components, as well as sawn timber.
2. **Moelven Wood**, which develops and produces a large range of wood-based building and interior products with a high level of processing.
3. **Moelven Building Systems**, which consists of laminated timber, modular buildings and interior solutions.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
