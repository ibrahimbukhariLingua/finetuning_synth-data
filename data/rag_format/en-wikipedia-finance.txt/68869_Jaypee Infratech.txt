## Jaypee Infratech insolvency case

In 2007, Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) proposed to build 32,000 housing units and plots after signing an agreement with Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to collect tolls on the expressway for 36 years and was allotted 25,000 hectares of land in Noida and Greater Noida and near Dankaur.

However, the company couldn't deliver the plots and houses as the construction on these projects was stopped around 2013 to 2014. In Suraksha Group acquired these projects from Jaypee Infratech Ltd and won the case and now over 20,000 homebuyers will get their homes which they had booked over a decade ago.
