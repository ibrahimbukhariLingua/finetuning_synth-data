## Biography

Stern was a stockholder of the Cincinnati Red Stockings by the 1882 season. With Justus Thorner as team president, the 1882 Red Stockings finished in first place in the American Association. Prior to the 1883 season, Stern was elected as president of the team. He was president at the conclusion of the 1890 season, when the team was sold.

Stern was the controlling owner of the Red Stockings at two different points in time. He initially owned the team during the 1884 season, preceded by Thorner and followed by George Herancourt, and later owned the team during the 1887–1890 seasons, preceded by John Hauck and followed by John T. Brush. Although personally generous, as an owner Stern was considered a penny-pincher, cutting salaries and costs in order to keep the team afloat.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
