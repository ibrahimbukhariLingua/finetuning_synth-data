## History

Halla Group was founded as **Hyundai International, Inc.** in 1962. The Halla name was first used in 1978 as the name of a cement company. The name Halla is taken from Mount Halla, a mountain on Jeju Island.

Halla collapsed in 1997 during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.

In 2008 Halla repurchased Mando, a car company they sold during the financial crisis. The chaebol also sponsors multiple hockey teams, mainly Anyang Halla in the Asia League Ice Hockey and Kiekko-Vantaa in the Finnish Mestis.
