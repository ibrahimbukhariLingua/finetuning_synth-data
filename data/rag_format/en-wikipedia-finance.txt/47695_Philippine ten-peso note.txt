### Independence


#### English series (1951–1974)

Features the portraits of Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, collectively known as Gomburza, three Filipino priests who were executed on February 17, 1872, at Bagumbayan in Manila, Philippines by Spanish colonial authorities on charges of subversion arising from the 1872 Cavite mutiny. The reverse features the Urdaneta and Legaspi Monument.


#### Pilipino series (1969–1974)

In 1967, Apolinario Mabini replaced the portraits of Gomburza. The note is now predominantly brown in color. On the reverse, it features the Barasoain Church, where the drafting of the Malolos Constitution and the inauguration of the First Philippine republic took place. The design of the obverse was later revised, the font for the text *Republika ng Pilipinas* and *Sampung Piso* were changed, the color of the portrait of Mabini was changed to a lighter shade of brown and geometric lines were added on the sides and the watermark area of the bill.


#### Ang Bagong Lipunan series (1973–1996)

In 1973, the "Ang Bagong Lipunan" text was added and was overprinted on the watermark area.


#### New Design series (1985–2018)

In 1985, the bill was completely redesigned but the portrait of Mabini remained the same. New elements regarding Mabini's career were shown on the right side, namely, his “El Verdadero Decalogo" ("*The True Dialogue*") which served as the introduction to the Malolos Constitution as a quill and an inkwell. The banknote was designed by Rafael Asuncion.

After the creation of the "Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas" in 1993, its new logo was incorporated on all the New Design series bills.

In 1997, the portrait of Andres Bonifacio was added beside Mabini, and elements from the Katipunan movement were added on the right side of the bill; one of the Katipunan flags and the *Kartilya ng Katipunan*. The design of the reverse was also changed. The scene from the Blood Compact of Katipuneros, previously featured in the *Pilipino* and *Ang Bagong Lipunan* series ₱5 bill was added on the right side of the Barasoain Church. The year of printing was added at the bottom of the denomination value located at the upper left corner of the obverse. However, the watermark area still only features Apolinario Mabini and the embedded security thread was on the right side of the signature of BSP governor until 1998 thus the notes with Andres Bonifacio from 1997 to 1998 uses the paper that would supposedly print the original 1985 version of the banknote with only Apolinario Mabini.

In 1998, Andres Bonifacio was added on the watermark area of the banknote and the embedded security thread was aligned beside the portrait.

In 1999, the names of the signatories on the bills were added starting with banknotes featuring the signature of President Joseph Estrada.

In 2001, the printing of this banknote was stopped after the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released the new ₱10 coin denomination in 2000, with the notes using the letters "FM" and with the signatures of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and BSP Governor Rafael B. Buenaventura being the last prefix used and batch of banknotes printed during its production (with the last batch comes in a folder).

However, existing banknotes, along with 5 peso banknotes, continued to be seen commonly in circulation from 2001 to 2004, and from 2004 until the demonetization of main banknotes under the *New Design Series* on January 3, 2018, it still had a liability of the BSP (with January 2018 submission of old banknotes are only for those who secure a receipt showing that they went to the central bank before the December 29, 2017 final deadline of submission due to not being able to accommodate several individuals who tried to exchange their notes because of the unexpected number of people who arrived) although now rarely circulated.
