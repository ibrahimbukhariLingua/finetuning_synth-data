SIOR designees can hold the following specialty designations: industrial, office, sales manager, executive manager, or advisory service. SIOR also includes associate members, who are corporate executives, developers, educators, and others involved in the commercial real estate industry.


## Founding

SIOR was originally SIR (Society of Industrial Realtors). In 1939, the idea of forming an organization for industrial real estate brokers began. The sequence of events can be summarized as follows:

* Despite the continued growth of industrial real estate, industrial real estate specialists had little representation within the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB).
* Industrial realtors Frank G. Binswanger and David T. Houston Sr. made an effort to organize and coordinate industrial realtors across the United States and Canada.
* They were able to gain sponsorship for the founding of Society of Industrial Realtors, and in the fall of 1940 at NAREB's national convention in Philadelphia, the formation of a national body of industrial realtors was approved.

One year and two months later, the US entered World War II.

The society was instrumental in locating existing, and immediately available, plant space that could be used to produce defense, and later, war material. Over 200 brokers from across the United States and Canada surveyed suitable facilities and reported their findings to the War Department (now the Department of Defense).
