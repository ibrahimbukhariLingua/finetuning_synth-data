## History

Darpan Sanghvi, with the backing of L'Occitane (a French beauty conglomerate), established a D2C beauty company called MyGlamm in 2017, which had over 800 SKUs on its D2C website and over 30,000 offline points of sales in over 70 cities. Meanwhile, back in 2013, Priyanka Gill founded POPxo, a digital community platform for millennial women that later launched its e-commerce division selling POPxo beauty products. In 2020, Sanghvi teamed up with Gill and purchased POPxo for an undisclosed sum. MyGlamm then went on to acquire BabyChakra, a content and community platform for young mothers set up in August 2021 by Naiyya Saggi.

In July 2021, MyGlamm secured INR 530 crore in a Series C funding round with Accel and existing investors in July 2021.

In September of the same year, the merger of all three companies, MyGlamm, POPxo, and BabyChakra, resulted in the formation of the Good Glamm Group.
