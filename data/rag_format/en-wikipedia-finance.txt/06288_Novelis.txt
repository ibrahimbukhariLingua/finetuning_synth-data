Novelis has been an independent subsidiary of the multinational aluminum and copper manufacturing company Hindalco Industries since 2007.


## Company history

The company was incorporated in 2004 after being spun off from Alcan, a now defunct Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer. In 2007 the company was acquired by Hindalco Industries for $6 billion, itself a subsidiary of the Aditya Birla Group.

In May 2024, Novelis filed its registration statement for a proposed IPO, but it withdrew its plans in October of the same year.


## Operations

Novelis is the world's largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet with operations in 11 countries. The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul and SÃ£o Paulo. Novelis also has operations in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam.

The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014. In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia, a $300 million expansion in Brazil and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.

Novelis recycles more than 70 billion used beverage cans each year.
