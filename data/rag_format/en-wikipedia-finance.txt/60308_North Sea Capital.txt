## History

The senior professionals of North Sea Capital started out as Nordea Private Equity, a unit of Nordea Investment Management, the asset management arm of the Nordea Group. On the back of a demand for private equity products from both institutional and private banking clients, Nordea and the senior investment professionals of Nordea Private Equity decided to pursue a strategy of creating a leading independent European private equity adviser. As a result of this decision, as of January 2007, the entire investment team of Nordea Private Equity was spun off into a new separate company, North Sea Capital, owned solely by the senior investment professionals. At the same time North Sea Capital was appointed exclusive private equity adviser to Nordea Investment Management.
