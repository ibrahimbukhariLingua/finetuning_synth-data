## Bridgeway foundation

Established in 2000, as the charitable giving arm of Bridgeway Capital Management, the Bridgeway Foundation works to establish peace and reconciliation in international communities suffering from oppression, genocide, and other human rights violations. As an attorney and advocate for social justice, Sedgwick Davis has led Bridgeway Foundation in developing solutions in remote environments. The organization has given financial support to organizations such as Aegis Trust, Resolve Uganda, and Invisible Children. Sedgwick Davis and the Bridgeway Foundation have been credited for their role in funding civilian protection and recovery efforts in Uganda against the Lord’s Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, the first-ever indictee of the International Criminal Court. The effort, as described in the New Yorker article, has also been criticized for funding mercenaries as a means to end genocide. Sedgwick Davis wrote an account of the group’s efforts in Uganda titled *To Stop a Warlord*, in which she details the nontraditional partnerships they established to combat Kony and the Lord’s Resistance Army.
