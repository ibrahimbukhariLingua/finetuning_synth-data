International Economic Development Council


# International Economic Development Council



The **International Economic Development Council** (IEDC) is a non-profit membership organization serving economic developers. With more than 4,500 members, IEDC is the largest national and global organization of its kind.

IEDC is located in Washington, D.C., and is governed by a board of directors and by the president and CEO, currently Nathan Ohle. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, IEDC is legally barred from endorsing political candidates and may only engage in limited lobbying activities.

IEDC's strategic directives include the core topics of globalization, sustainability, entrepreneurship, and economic restructuring. IEDC works with communities and economic development organizations to weave these core topics into pertinent economic development projects, such as community revitalization, business development, and job creation nationwide and abroad.


## Background

The IEDC was created as a result of a merger between the Council of Urban Economic Development (CUED) and the American Economic Development Council (AEDC) in May 2001. Both AEDC and CUED were organizations that were formed as a result of efforts by businessmen and civic leaders. Founders came from the railroad utilities, and the public and private sectors. Despite their diverse backgrounds and professional experiences, founders of each organization shared a common passion to develop their cities and communities into vibrant places to live and do business.

The AEDC had been operating in various forms since 1926 with focus on industrial development. AEDC had been linked to the Economic Development Institute (EDI) since the early 1960s, with the focus on training and development for economic development as a profession. Notably, AEDC's education initiatives developed professionalism in the field, fostered the sharing of best practices among economic developers and cultivated an expertise among those in the profession. AEDC members offered their services around the world in order to encourage the use of common economic development tools internationally. AEDC traditionally had a high representation of members from the American South, and a large contingent of Canadian members that concentrated on forging ties with the private sector.

The CUED originated as "Helping Urban Business", or the HUB Council, in 1966. It changed its name to CUED in 1974. The founding of the CUED followed the civil disturbances/urban riots in Watts in Los Angeles and other cities like Detroit, Newark and Washington. These disturbances further weakened the position of many urban economies, as manufacturing and commercial businesses increased their exodus to the suburbs and outer transportation corridors. The CUED's primary objective was to develop an urban policy for economic development. In 1968, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) provided the CUED with a grant for technical assistance, information, and research. From its early days, CUED established itself as a go-to organization for research and technical assistance on federal programs like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program and the UDAG Program and played an important role in helping to develop strong economic development policies.
