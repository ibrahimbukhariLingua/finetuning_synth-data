## History


### Early years: 1923–1950s

Merritt J. "M.J." Osborn founded Economics Laboratory in 1923. The company's original product was Absorbit, a product designed to quickly clean carpets in hotel rooms. This was soon followed by Soilax, a dishwasher soap.

During the 1930s, the company expanded throughout the United States, with sales reaching US$5.4 million by the end of 1940s. It acquired the Magnus Company in the early 1950s, giving the company access to Magnus's industrial specialty businesses – including pulp and paper, metalworking, transportation, and petrochemical processing.


### Transition to a public corporation and expansion: 1950s–1986

In the 1950s, international expansion of Economics Laboratory started with the establishment of its first overseas subsidiary in Sweden in 1956. It became a publicly traded corporation in 1957. In 1979, it acquired Apollo Technologies, which would be shut down in 1983 as a subsidiary. In 1984, Ecolab acquired pest elimination company Lystads, Inc., of Grand Forks, North Dakota.
