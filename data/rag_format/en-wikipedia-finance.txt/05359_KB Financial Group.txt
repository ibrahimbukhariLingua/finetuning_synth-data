## History

KB Financial Group was established through the restructuring of Kookmin Bank into a holding company in September 2008. Kookmin Bank launched a financial holding firm to boost non-banking operations such as brokerage, insurance, and consumer finance. After its establishment, KB acquired non-banking financial services companies, including LIG Insurance, Hyundai Securities, Prudential Life Korea, etc.

In 2015, KB acquired LIG Insurance, South Korea's fourth-largest non-life insurance company with assets totaling 24 trillion won, from LIG Group and changed its name to KB Insurance. KB also took over Hyundai Securities from Hyundai Group after beating Korea Investment and Hong Kong–based private equity firm Actis in 2016. KB has merged its existing stock brokerage firm KB Investment & Securities with Hyundai Securities and renamed it as KB Securities. In 2020, KB reinforced its life insurance business by acquiring a 100% stake in Prudential Financial Inc's South Korean unit for 2.3 trillion won.

In 2021, KB Financial Group bought a majority stake in the Indonesia-based Bank Bukopin and rebranded it into KB Bukopin.
