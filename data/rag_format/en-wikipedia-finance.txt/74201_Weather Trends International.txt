# Weather Trends International



**Weather Trends International** is an American company that provides year-ahead weather guidance for retailers, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, agricultural firms, and financial analysts worldwide. Its weather solutions are used to help businesses and farmers to manage the weather risk.

To forecast the weather, Weather Trends uses a statistical methodology that was first developed in the early 1990s. An independent study from 2014 verified that its forecasts project temperature, precipitation and snowfall trends up to a year ahead worldwide with more than 80% accuracy.

Kirk was previously the vice president of client services at Planalytics.
