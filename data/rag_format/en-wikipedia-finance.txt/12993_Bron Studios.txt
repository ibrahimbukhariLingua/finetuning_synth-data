## History


### Bron Studios

Bron Studios was founded in 2010 by Aaron L. Gilbert and Brenda Gilbert. Originally from London, Ontario, Aaron began his career in the music industry before segueing into film finance and production. He served as the managing director of Media House Capital, a senior lender in the film and television business, prior to launching the company.

Bron formed Bron Animation division led by Gil Rimmer and Ben Burden Smith as creative directors. The division's first project was two *Mighty Mighty Monsters* specials.


#### Bankruptcy and involvement in securities fraud

On July 19, 2023, Bron Studios filed for creditor protection in Canada, and Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the United States, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes as the reasons of its eventual downfall. However, an April 28, 2023 report by the American Bar Association described a $100 million securities fraud perpetrated by Clayton Smith and Crystal Wealth Management, involving loans to BRON group productions. The report also stated "there appears to be clear evidence that Gilbert, Thibault, and Smith worked together to mislead Crystal Wealthâ€™s auditor BDO by coordinating their responses to inquiries about the financial position of the film loans."


### Bron Media

In September 2017, Bron Studios was reorganized with Bron Media Corp. becoming Bron Studios' parent company. Genre label the Realm, Bron Releasing and Bron Animation joined the studio as Bron Media subsidiaries. Daniel D. McClure was also hired as president and chief operating officer from his position as Toronto-based CQI Capital Management CEO.

Its Bron Venture unit invested in starting up Media Res, Michael Ellenberg's TV and film production company in June 2017. Bron would also find financing for the start up's projects.

By 2016, Bron Media and Creative Wealth Media form a joint venture, Bron Creative, to fund films. The venture's first film is *Fences* by Paramount Pictures. Next, the venture agreed to fully finance an animated film series, up to four films, based on Bear Grylls produced by YBG Films, a joint venture between Grylls and Platinum Films. In December 2018, Bron Creative and Warner Bros. agreed to a six film slate deal with $100 million in co-financing. Bron Creative agreed to another $100 million co-financing slate deal with MGM in June 2019.


### Bron TV

In the late 2010s, Bron began developing an internal television production group and partnered with producer and former HBO executive Michael Ellenberg's production company Media Res. Bron coproduced a series of international projects at this time. In 2019 and 2020, furthered expanded their television venture into a formal division.
