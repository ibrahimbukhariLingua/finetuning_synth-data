## Chairman of the Israel Securities Authority

In May 2011, Hauser was appointed chairman of the Israeli SecuritiesAuthority by Israel's Minister of Finance, Yuval Steinitz.

Professor Hauser's term is characterized by activism, increased enforcement and the opening of criminal investigations against senior executives.

He ordered to open in a criminal investigation against Nochi Dankner, the controlling shareholder of IDB Holding Corp. LTD, regarding a possible market manipulation (pump and dump). After the court ruling in which judge Khaled Kabub determined that Dankner was guilty, Hauser said: "I believe in uncompromising enforcement that creates deterrence". In 2017 he ordered opening of another criminal high-profile investigation against Bezeq Officials.

On taking up his post in May 2011, prof. Hauser proposed installing an electronic voting system to allow holders of securities to vote via the internet at meetings at which they are entitled to vote. The system became operational in June 2015.

In 2012, Hauser presented a road map for the Securities Authority, which included deregulation and removal of barriers during its process on one hand, and uncompromising enforcement on the other hand. The plan was fully approved in legislation in May 2016.

In 2013, Hauser led several actions which were aimed to protect the investors in the capital market along with the facilitation of regulation in order to help the companies in the market. Among these actions:

* A law promoting deregulation for the companies.
* Launching the CMMF (Conservative Money Market Fund) aimed at promoting the public's involvement and investment in the capital market.
* Reduction in distribution fees.

In that year, Hauser appointed two committees: the first was aimed to encourage investments in public companies operating in the field of research and development, and the second was aimed to improve trading and encourage liquidity in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In 2016, the second committee's conclusions were translated into "The Research and Development" legislation that eased on high-tech companies to issue shares in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and therefore encouraged them to do so.

In 2015–2017, following the collapse of alleged Ponzi schemes, namely Hilik Tapiro's Or Fund and Amir Bramly's Kela Fund, and a boom in unregulated activity due to harsh regulation on the one hand and the low interest rate on the other Hauser has taken steps to prevent unregulated offerings to the public. These including warning the public of risks, stern public speeches likening unregulated investment to a jungle, and prohibiting publication of financial details, including expected return, on any unregulated investment without issuing a prospectus

In 2017, Hauser nominated two another committees – on the need to regulate ICO's. He himself was appointed to co-chair a committee by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Justice on the need of a secondary exchange in Israel for SMEs.

Prof. Hauser also instigated reliefs on IPOs, giving companies issuing for the first time on the Stock Exchange a "Joining Basket", a 5-year benefits plan from the date of issue. During that time, these companies would enjoy considerable regulatory reliefs in order to make it easier for them to adapt to the process of becoming a reporting corporation. He also initiated another reform of regulation to encourage IPO's of High tech firms and another reform to encourage public financing SMEs.

In February 2016 Hauser's term was extended by the Minister of Finance, Moshe Kahlon, with additional three years.

In March 2016, the Securities Authority under prof. Hauser initiated prohibition of offering Binary Options to local Israeli investors. Hauser expressed his disgust at the phenomena and called on the Attorney General of Israel to act. In the wake of these regulatory measures, a number of companies trading abroad closed down their operations in Israel. Meanwhile, the ISA drafted a law in early 2017 that was approved by Israel's cabinet in June 2017, banning the sale of binary options overseas by online trading firms based in Israel. The law was finally approved by the Knesset in October 2017.

In 2017, professor Hauser led a process to demutualize at the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, in accordance to the structural change undergone by all Stock Exchanges around the world in modern times. Hauser is also promoting the supervision upon electronic trading systems. Recently, The Knesset approved a bill aimed to ensure that operating and marketing of trading systems. would be conducted fairly, while the customers' money would be safeguarded. By 2016, the licensing process has ended and today there are six companies with a license for a forex trading platforms.

In November 2017, he announced he would step down for his role in ISA in the beginning of 2018.
