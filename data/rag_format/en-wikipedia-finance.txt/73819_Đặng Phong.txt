Upon Vietnam's reunification in 1975, he conducted research on Vietnam's economic history using the archive left behind by South Vietnam government. This is their researches, plans and strategies on developing agriculture, industry and education which Đặng Phong deemed to be detailed and can serve as part of his own post-war development plan for Vietnam.

His book *Lịch sử kinh tế Việt Nam* was published in 2000, in a review for *Lao Động* the newspaper, Y Trang considered Đặng Phong so far has been a non-notable historian, attributing the causes to economic history field not being much appreciated.
