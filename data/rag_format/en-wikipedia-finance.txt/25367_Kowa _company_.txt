**Kowa Company, Ltd.** (Japanese: 興和株式会社) is a Japanese specialized trading company and manufacturer. Its headquarters are located in Nagoya, the capital of Japan's Aichi prefecture.


## Overview

Kowa Company is the core of the umbrella Kowa Group. Other companies within the group include Kowa's sibling firm Kowabo Company, Ltd. [ja] and the consolidated subsidiary Kowa Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. [ja]. Its predecessor, Hattori Kensaburo Shoten, notably supported the industrialist Sakichi Toyoda's development of his automatic loom. The business is divided into trading and manufacturing divisions. The trading company division trades in fibers, machines, building materials, watercraft, mineral resources, chemical materials, and everyday goods. Meanwhile, the manufacturing division produces medicine, medical equipment, optical instruments, and energy-saving products.

Marketing of Kowa medical products under such brand names as Colgen Kowa and Cabagin Kowa via nationwide TV commercials increased the company's brand recognition.
