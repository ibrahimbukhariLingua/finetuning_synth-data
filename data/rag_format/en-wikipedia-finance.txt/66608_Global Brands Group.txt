## Background

The history of Global Brands Group can be traced back to 2005 when Li & Fung Limited established a wholesale business focusing on private label and branded apparel in order to broaden its relationships with existing and new retailer customers. On 4 December 2013, in preparation for the spin-off from Li & Fung and Listing, Global Brands Group was incorporated in Bermuda. On 13 December 2013, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Li & Fung.

On 9 July 2014, Global Brands Group was listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by way of introduction as a result of a spin-off from Li & Fung. Its business is now separate and independent from Li & Fung's trading and logistics businesses.

On 3 December 2014, Global Brands Group, together with David Beckham announced the launch of a joint venture, Seven Global, to drive the continued development of all consumer product categories around David Beckham.

For financial year 2020 the company posted a loss of US$584 million vs a loss of US$388 million in 2019, widening by almost US$200 million.
