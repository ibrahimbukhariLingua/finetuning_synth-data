Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System


# Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System



The **Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System (OFPRS)** is an agency of the government of Oklahoma that manages the public pension system for firefighters in Oklahoma. The System provides pension benefits such as normal retirement, disability retirement, surviving spouse benefits and a death benefit.

The System receives its funding from employer and member contributions, a portion of the state insurance premium tax and returns on investments. The System is overseen by a 13-member Board of Trustees, which is responsible for governing the System and appointing the Executive Director to run the System.

The System was created in 1980 during the term of Governor of Oklahoma George Nigh.
