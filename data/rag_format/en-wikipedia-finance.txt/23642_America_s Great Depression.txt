America's Great Depression


# America's Great Depression



***America's Great Depression*** is a 1963 treatise on the 1930s Great Depression and its root causes, written by Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard.

The book blames government policy failures for the Great Depression, and challenges the widely-held view that capitalism is unstable.


## Summary

Rothbard argues that it was the interventionist policies of the Herbert Hoover administration which magnified the duration, breadth, and intensity of the Great Depression. Rothbard explains the Austrian theory of the business cycle, which holds that government manipulation of the money supply sets the stage for the familiar "boom-bust" phases of the modern market. He then details the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve from 1921 to 1929 as evidence that the depression was essentially caused not by speculation, but by government and central bank interference in the market.ᵗʰⁱʳᵈ-ᵖᵃʳᵗʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
