## History

Ramp was founded in March 2019 by Eric Glyman, Karim Atiyeh, and Gene Lee. Glyman and Atiyeh met as classmates at Harvard University and had previously founded price tracking app Paribus, which was acquired by Capital One in 2016.

Glyman and Atiyeh talked with approximately 100 finance experts before launching Ramp's corporate card, finding that potential clients were unhappy with the inefficiency of existing methods for collecting receipts and logging expenses.

The company was formally launched in February 2020, and reached $100 million in annualized revenue by early 2022. In 2023, Ramp was named to the CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

As of 2024, Ramp had reached $300 million in annualized revenue with more than 25,000 businesses on its platform. That June, it secured $150 million in a Series D-2 funding round, maintaining its valuation at $7.65 billion. This round was co-led by Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund, among other investors.
