**Alberto Maria Genovese** (Naples, May 28, 1977) is an Italian entrepreneur, founder and president of Facile.it and Prima Assicurazioni, known as the "king of startups" for his initiatives in the sector.


## Biography

After graduating in Business administration from the Bocconi University, in 1999 Alberto Genovese was hired by Goldman Sachs, later moving to McKinsey & Company and then Bain & Company. From 2005 to 2009, he worked for eBay as the head of the Motors and New Businesses division.


### Entrepreneurial activities

In 2008, following his time at eBay, Genovese founded Facile.it (initially named Assicurazioni.it), a comparison website for insurance and financial products. The company was sold to Oakley Capital in 2014, with Mauro Giacobbe taking over as CEO shortly after.

In the same year, together with George Ottathycal Kuruvilla and Teodoro D'Ambrosio, Genovese founded Prima Assicurazioni, a tech company operating as an insurance agency. In the summer of 2018, Prima Assicurazioni closed Italy's largest venture capital funding round: a €100 million increase, with Goldman Sachs and Blackstone Group as investors.

In 2015, he founded Brumbrum, an online used car retailer in Italy, which he sold in 2019.

Around the same time, he held stakes and served as president in various startups such as Abiby (in the beauty sector), Zappyrent (in the tech sector), and Jobtech (tech). In 2022, Genovese sold his stake in Prima Assicurazioni.


### Drug addiction and legal issues

In October 2020, Genovese was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old girl at a party in his home, one of many drug-fueled parties held at "Terrazza Sentimento".

In July 2021, Genovese was released from San Vittore prison to undergo drug rehabilitation at the Crest community in Cuveglio. Meanwhile, the number of allegations from young women claiming to be victims of violence increased.

The trial for the assaults on the first two women to report him ended with Genovese receiving a final sentence of 6 years and 11 months in prison. In February 2023, Genovese returned to prison in Bollate to serve the remaining sentence.

In July 2024, a second trial concluded: Genovese was acquitted of charges involving a former girlfriend (herself under investigation for slander) but was convicted of attempted violence and other offenses, receiving a 15-month sentence.


### Social commitment

In 2022, with judicial approval, Genovese and his sister established the Franco Latanza Foundation, named after their grandfather, to support drug addicts in covering rehabilitation costs at public therapeutic communities.

In August 2024, the Milan Supervisory Court granted Genovese permission to perform volunteer work outside the detention facility four days a week: three at Casa della Carità, led by Don Virginio Colmegna, and one at the "Wall of Dolls" association, which assists female victims of violence.


## Personal life

In 2022, Alberto Genovese married a university companion.
