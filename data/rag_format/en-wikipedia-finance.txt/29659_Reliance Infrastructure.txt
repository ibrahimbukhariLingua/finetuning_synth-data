## History

The predecessor company, Reliance Energy Limited, came into existence when it took over an 83-year-old government undertaking, the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply (BSES) in 2002. BSES was originally founded in October 1929.

In April 2008, Reliance Energy Limited changed its name to Reliance Infrastructure Limited. The company entered the road building industry in 2006 with two National Highway projects in Tamil Nadu (Namakkal-Karur and Dindigul-Samayanallur), both sections of National Highway 44 (formerly NH 7). In 2011, it was announced that the company was planning to buy out licences to build road projects from companies unable to do so.

In September 2018, at a time of financial stress, R-Infra sold its power transmission business in Mumbai to Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited for ₹18,800 crore (equivalent to ₹250 billion or US$3.0 billion in 2023).

In October 2024, Reliance Infrastructure board has approved raising of $350 million (Rs 2,930 crore) through ultra-low cost 10-year maturity unsecured foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs). The board also approved the employees stock option scheme (ESOPs), which will provide a grant of up to 26 million equity shares of value of over Rs 850 crore.


## BSES Delhi

Till 2002, the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) used to supply electricity to NCT of Delhi, except areas of Lutyens and Cantonment which were & are still catered by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Military Engineer Services (MES) respectively. The same year in July, DVB was unbundled and was split into 3 distribution companies namely, BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) & Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL). Both BRPL and BYPL are 51:49% joint venture between Reliance Infrastructure and Government of Delhi. Since then, BRPL supplies electricity to South & West Delhi covering an area of 750 sq. km. Similarly, BYPL supplies electricity to Central & East Delhi covering an area of around 200 km².


## Transportation


### Airports

Reliance Infrastructure with its subsidiary company, Reliance Airport Developers Limited (RADL) operated five minor brownfield airports in various small towns of Maharashtra, viz. Nanded Airport, Latur Airport, Baramati Airport, Yavatmal Airport, and Osmanabad Airport. In March 2015, the Government of Maharashtra was looking at cancelling the agreements and taking back control of the airports due to slow progress.

In March 2019, the company received a contract from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) worth ₹ 648 crores (USD 92 million) for the construction of Rajkot Greenfield Airport at Hirasar in Rajkot district of Gujarat state.


### Metro projects

* Line-1 of Phase-1 of Mumbai Metro: One of the three metro lines in this phase was awarded to a consortium led by R-Infra. The other two lines were awarded to other parties. Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd, which is a consortium of R-Infra, Veolia Transport, and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) secured the contract for the ₹23.56 billion (US$280 million) Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar section. Mumbai Metro I is operational. The project will be implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis, where the consortium will collect revenue for 35 years and then hand over the infrastructure to the government.
* Line 4 of Phase 2 of Mumbai Metro: The contracts for three "packages" (18 stations) have been awarded to a consortium led by R-Infra, but apparently, the contract does not include the laying of any tracks. The total length of Line-4 is 32.32 km (20.08 mi) with 32 stations, and the line will connect Wadala to Kasarvadavali via Ghatkopar and Mulund. Out of this, the contract for constructing three "packages" (18 stations) has been awarded to the "Reliance-Astaldi Joint Venture." Construction began in June 2018 and is expected to be completed by 2021.
* Airport Express (Orange Line): The Airport Express line of Delhi Metro connecting New Delhi railway station to Dwarka Sector-21 metro station, through the Indira Gandhi International Airport.

### Toll roads

Reliance Infrastructure is the largest concessionaire of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), having received as many as eleven contracts to build roads under the NHDP Phase-V. These eleven contracts involve constructing about 1,000 km of highway and expressway projects worth ₹120 billion (US$1.4 billion). All the projects are on Build–Operate–Transfer scheme of funding, where R-Infra is required to raise all its own funds and gets to collect tolls on the road for a period of thirty years. Three of the projects (all in Tamil Nadu) are already operational. The eleven projects are:

* DA Toll Road (180 km six-lane between Delhi and Agra on NH-2 in the state of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh)
* PS Toll Road (140 km six-lane road connecting Pune and Satara in Maharashtra on NH-4)

### Bridges

Reliance Infrastructure and Hyundai Engineering formed a joint venture to build the Worli-Haji Ali Sea Link, part of the Western Freeway. The consortium was also to toll the Bandra Worli Sea Link for 40 years. In early 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai proposed constructing a 35 km coastal road between Nariman Point and Kandivali.

Reliance protested against this project as it claimed it would incur losses. Subsequently, the Government of Maharashtra appointed a committee to look into the matter. Later, it was reported that the MSRDC was likely to cancel the deal with Reliance due to the latter not having started construction two years after signing the agreement. Afterwards, it was announced that the deal was canceled as the mediation report stated that it was impossible to build.
