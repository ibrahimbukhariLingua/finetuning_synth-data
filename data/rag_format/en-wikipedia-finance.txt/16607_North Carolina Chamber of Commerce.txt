#### NC Commerce Protection Act of 2013

The NC Chamber, along with the North Carolina Commerce Coalition, was a major supporter of the NC Commerce Protection Act of 2013 (Senate Bill 648). This legislation, commonly referred to as an ag-gag bill, seeks to criminalize undercover investigations by journalists and advocates seeking to document and expose illegal activity on industrial farms and other food production facilities. The NC Chamber supported the NC Commerce Protection Act as a way to strengthen employment fraud prevention and reduce litigation against businesses.

Opponents of the NC Commerce Protection Act expressed concern that the legislation would hinder animal cruelty and human welfare investigations at North Carolina's many agricultural and food production facilities and prevent prosecution of animal abusers. Undercover investigations have been successful in exposing animal cruelty and food safety violations. Several North Carolina newspapers published editorials and opinions opposing the NC Commerce Protection Act, including the Fayetteville Observer, the News & Observer, and the Wilson Times Archived 2013-06-20 at the Wayback Machine.

In May 2013, the Humane Society of the United States aired a television commercial criticizing the NC Chamber's support of the NC Commerce Protection Act and the bill's hindrance of animal cruelty investigations The NC Chamber responded in a statement that the bill would strengthen cruelty reporting guidelines.
