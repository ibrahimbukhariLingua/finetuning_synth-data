## History

The Wake Forest School of Business Administration was founded in 1949 by Professor Gaines M. Rogers, with seven or eight full-time faculty, and offering two degrees: B.S and B.B.A. In 1968 Rogers resigned as dean of the school, and was replaced by Harvard finance professor Robert S. Carlson, who instituted the school's first MBA program. In 1970, the school was transformed into a department within the college, and in doing so lost its AACSB accreditation. In 1980 the department was again reorganized into the School of Business and Accountancy with Thomas C. Taylor as dean. Subsequently, the school was re-accredited in 1985. Beginning in 1994, the school began to offer two new programs: a Master of Science in Accountancy, and a B.S. in Analytical Finance. In 1995, the school was renamed the Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy, after former graduate and CEO of PepsiCo Inc. Wayne Calloway, who had been a long-standing friend of the university. In 2003, the school relocated to its current home in F.M. Kirby hall in the Wayne Calloway Center.

Steven Reinemund was announced at the new dean of the combined Calloway and Babcock Schools on April 22, 2008. He is the former CEO and chairman of PepsiCo and current board member of numerous Fortune 100 companies.
