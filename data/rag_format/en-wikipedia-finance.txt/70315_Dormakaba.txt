### History of Kaba

In 1862, Franz Bauer founded Kaba in Zurich as a locksmith shop and cash register factory. The firm was sold in 1915 to Leo Bodmer, who renamed the company to Bauer AG. When inventor Fritz Schori created the first cylinder lock with reversible key in 1934, Bauer AG patented the invention and named the lock after the firm's founder Franz Bauer, known in German as '**Ka**ssen**ba**uer' (maker of cash registers) – 'Kaba' for short.

Over the years, the company gradually expanded its portfolio and established itself throughout Europe. In 1995, Bauer Holding AG was renamed to Kaba Holding AG and the company's shares were listed on the Zurich stock exchange.

With the takeover of Unican Security Systems (Montreal) in 2001, Kaba gained a foothold in North America and added the Silca, Ilco and Kaba Mas brands as part of the merger.

In 2006, the company acquired the Wah Yuet Group in China, the US company Computerized Security Systems (CSS) with its well-known Saflok and La Gard brands, and the Dutch company H. Cillekens Zn. B.V. In addition, it entered into various joint ventures with the Indian Minda Group.

At Security 2008, Kaba was awarded the «Security Innovation Award» in gold for its newly developed identification technology RCID.

In 2011, Kaba sold the business segment Door Automation (Kaba Gilgen AG, formerly Gilgen AG) to the Japanese Nabtesco Group.

In 2015, the company merged with Dorma.
