## History

The original Pinsly Railroad Company dated back to 1938 and is one of the oldest short-line holding companies in U.S. history. Today's Pinsly was founded as **RailUSA** in October 2018 by private equity firm Equity Group Investments.

RailUSA first purchased the Grenada Railroad from Iowa Pacific with plans to restore and re-open the 87-mile southern portion of the line, which had been closed since 2011. Another investment followed in 2019 with the purchase of Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad from CSX.

In April 2022, RailUSA was purchased by Macquarie Infrastructure Partners. On March 1, 2023, RailUSA announced they would relocate to Jacksonville, Florida, and change their name to Gulf & Atlantic Railways, showing focus on new growth.

In May 2023, G&AR acquired 3 small railroads from Midwestern & Bluegrass Rail, the Camp Chase Railroad, Chesapeake & Indiana Railroad and Vermilion Valley Railroad, and increased its portfolio from two to five short lines. In August 2023, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners reached an agreement with the Pinsly Railroad Company to acquire a 6th short-line, Pioneer Valley Railroad, through its subsidiary Gulf & Atlantic Railways. This acquisition also included a warehousing company, Railroad Distribution Services. Towards the end of 2023, G&AR announced they would acquire the Northern Indiana Railroad Company (NIRC), which maintained the land assets of the Chesapeake & Indiana Railroad (CKIN).

In February 2024, G&AR announced they would seek to merge NIRC into the CKIN. On May 1, 2024, the company rebranded to Pinsly Railroad Company. On August 20, 2024, they entered into a definitive agreement, subject to regulatory approval, to acquire Hondo Railway.
