In 2016, Toks announced they were opening ten new restaurants across Mexico. Gustavo Pérez, Director of Toks' Social Responsibility Department, said that Toks' growth was of 15 to 18% every year, while the rest of the industry was experiencing 2 to 3% growth. Along with the opening of more locations, Toks also announced the acquisition of Restaurantes California, a chain owned by Comercial Mexicana.

He concluded the interview by stating that Toks had been innovating their business since 2001 to increase restaurant attendance.
