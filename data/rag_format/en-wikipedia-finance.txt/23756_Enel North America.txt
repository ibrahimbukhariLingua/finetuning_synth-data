## History


### 2000–2015: Establishment in North America and Renewable Energy Growth

In December 2000, Enel Group entered the US market and acquired the American renewable energy producer CHI Energy, taking over a portfolio of 254 MW of hydro energy In 2003, CHI Energy officially changed its name to Enel North America Inc.

With the creation of Enel Green Power – the business line founded in 2008 and dedicated to developing, building, operating and selling renewable energy – the company expanded its portfolio in North America to 570 MW, including biomass, wind and geothermal energy. Also in 2008, Enel Green Power announced the launching of its first wind and solar projects in the United States, namely the Snyder wind farm in Texas, the Minnesota Wind farm in Minnesota, the Smoky Hills wind farm in Kansas, and the Sheldon Springs solar farm in Vermont.

In 2010, the Group extended its presence in North America with its first renewable energy project in Canada. As of today, it operates three wind facilities based in Alberta, with a total clean energy capacity of 210 MW.


### 2015–2017: Hybrid Plant Innovation and PPAs

In 2015, Enel developed Stillwater, the first hybrid plant in the world to combine geothermal, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy. Located in Churchill County, Nevada, it consists of a 33 MW geothermal plant, a 26 MWdc photovoltaic solar plant, a 27 MWdc photovoltaic solar plant, and a 2 MW solar thermal plant. Stillwater combines the continuous generating capacity of medium enthalpy, binary cycle geothermal power with solar photovoltaic and solar thermal sources.

In 2016, with the completion of Kansas's 400 MW Cimarron Bend wind farm, Enel Green Power reached 3 GW of renewable capacity across North America. 2016 was also the year of Enel Green Power's first power purchase agreement (PPA), which was signed with Google with the entry into service of the first 200 MW of the facility. A second 200-MW PPA was signed with the Kansas City Board of Public Utilities (BPU), which is a not-for-profit public utility. In 2016, Enel North America also started the Cove Fort hybrid plant in Utah, the world's first large scale power generation facility combining geothermal and hydropower technologies.


### 2017–2019: Expansion into Advanced Energy Services and Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

In 2017, Enel inaugurated its new North American headquarters in Andover, Massachusetts. The headquarters’ construction and design included a carpet made from recycled materials, electric vehicle charging stations, low-flow water fixtures, LED lighting, and a recycling and composting program. Also in 2017, the company opened a trading business line now known as Energy and Commodity Management. In the same year, Enel acquired Demand Energy Networks (a developer and operator of energy storage systems and software), eMotorWerks (a company operating a network of electric vehicle charging ports and supplies, charging stations known as JuiceBox) and EnerNOC (a demand response provider and a player in energy software). In October 2018, these companies were integrated as Enel X, Enel's business line dedicated to the development of products and digital solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for cities, homes, industries, and electric mobility.

In 2018, the American Wind Energy Association named Enel Green Power as the fastest-growing wind operator. The company also signed clean energy contracts with large corporations including Anheuser-Busch, Kohler, Facebook, Adobe, Starbucks, Bloomberg LP, and General Motors. In the same year, it announced the deployment of a 1-MWh lithium-ion battery storage system in Canada for Ontario-based retail apple orchard Algoma Orchards.

In 2019, Enel Green Power completed the acquisition of Tradewind Energy – a US greenfield renewables developer – adding a 7 GW pipeline of wind, solar and storage facilities. Also in 2019, Anheuser Busch aired a Super Bowl ad describing the company's commitment to brew all Budweiser products in the US with wind energy, a result of a power purchase agreement with Enel. Enel also opened a new Innovation Hub in Boston at Greentown Labs, the largest cleantech startup incubator in the US.


### 2019–present: Reorganizing as Enel North America

After several years operating only through separate business lines – Enel Green Power North America and Enel X North America – the company reconstituted Enel North America, Inc. as a parent entity in 2019. In the same year, Enel became the official energy partner of Gillette Stadium.

In 2020, Enel X partnered with UMass Boston, to develop a 1 MW solar photovoltaic system, a 500 kW/2MWh lithium-ion battery storage system, and 11 Enel X JuiceBox electric vehicle (EV) smart charging stations on the campus.

## Presence in the United States and Canada

Enel North America's EV charging unit served commercial and residential customers across the U.S. and Canada until October 2024, when it announced that it would end North American product support on Friday, October 11. The residential chargers will continue to work, but customers will lose features like app access to check charging status and history, and to schedule charging. Commercial chargers, however, "will lose functionality in the absence of software continuity". The company cited slow EV market growth and high interest rates as reasons for its exit. The Linux Foundation's LF Energy project used the incident to make the case for using vendor-agnostic open source code in EV charging infrastructure to prevent such stranded assets.

Just days before the end of Enel X server access, the EV charging community mobilized to discuss possible solutions. Various highly regarded YouTube EV channels (Transport Evolved, State of Charge) assembled panels of charging hardware and software experts to assess the situation and make plans, including contacting several state attorneys general. Consumer Reports, U.S. PIRG and charger owners submitted a petition to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protesting the abrupt end of sales and support. An ad-hoc group called Juice Rescue launched a website to help gather and share information about the transition away from Enel X chargers. A day before the planned end date, Enel X announced that it would delay the shutdown deadline "for an extended period" and find a third party to support its user base.


### Oklahoma

Enel North America started generating energy from wind sources in Oklahoma through Enel Green Power in 2012, with the first wind farm being Rocky Ridge. Since then, the company has built or started construction of 13 wind farms in Oklahoma, representing over 2 GW of operating capacity.

Its Origin wind farm – a 150-megawatt plant located near Hennepin, Oklahoma – started operating in September 2015. Origin has 75 Vestas wind turbines and can power about 55,000 homes. It was the third Enel North America project to start production in Oklahoma since 2012.

## Sustainability and innovation commitment

In 2021, Enel Group brought forward its Net-Zero commitment by 10 years, to 2040, to address Enel's direct and indirect emissions. In the U.S. and Canada, its energy generation fleet is 100% renewables-based. In 2020–2021, Enel North America supported 236 sustainability projects ranging from workforce development to environmental sustainability.

For example, as part of its sustainability and innovation commitment, the company is exploring how to use spent blades for long-duration energy storage. The project is carried out in collaboration with energy storage startup Energy Vault and aims at exploring how to grind up blades, remove the fibers and use them to fortify the large blocks Energy Vault plans to use for its proposed gravity-based system. In the meantime, ground-up blades are already being put to use to make cement.

Following Enel North America's acquisition of a portfolio of six development-stage solar-plus-storage projects in New Jersey, a proposed sustainability and innovation project features the combination of solar generation and agriculture on the same piece of land ("agrivoltaics" or "dual-use solar"). As a result, one of the properties involved will have an integrated sheep farm, a way to continue the agricultural use of the property and avoid expensive grass mowing.

Enel North America also contributes to the Oklahoma Leopold Conservation Award, which recognizes agricultural landowners actively committed to a land ethic. The program builds bridges between agriculture, government, environmental organizations, industry and academia to advance the cause of private lands conservation. The Oklahoma Leopold Conservation Award consists of $10,000 and a crystal award.

The company also established two Innovation Hubs in the U.S., one in San Francisco and one in Boston. Innovation Hubs are physical spaces where startups can present their projects to Enel's Innovation Managers, as well as to each other. This allows Enel to collaborate with energy startups and help them develop, test, and scale new technologies and business models. Innovation Hubs are also able to work with each other.
In October 2020, Enel North America expanded its energy innovation reach into Canada through a partnership with MaRS Discovery District, North America's urban innovation hub. The project focuses on specific topics related to energy transition, digitization, clean technology, and automation.
In October 2022, Enel North America opened a wind training facility and office in Oklahoma City to train wind turbine technicians. The facility includes classrooms and simulation facilities for learning how to work inside turbines, as well as courses on safety, professional development, working at heights, and ladder rescues taught through virtual reality, hands-on simulation, and discussions. Each year, the facility could train more than 150 new and existing employees.
