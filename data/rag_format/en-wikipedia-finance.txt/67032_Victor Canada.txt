## History

Victor Canada traces its history back to the establishment of Farquhar Bethune Insurance, founded in 1962 as a personal and commercial insurance agent.

In the decade following its foundation, the company introduced professional liability coverage for architects and engineers before establishing an engineered construction facility in 1970, thus creating the ENCON name, to underwrite property and liability insurance for construction risks. It subsequently developed a directors and officers program and errors and omissions coverage, further broadening its product base.

In 1986, it was acquired by Victor O. Schinnerer & Company, Inc. (now Victor), a U.S.-based underwriting management company and wholly owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc.

In 1994, Victor Canada’s product offerings were expanded to include group and retiree benefits.


## Products

Victor Canada provides liability insurance to architects and engineers, construction contractors, professionals involved in design-build projects, directors and officers, IT professionals, environmental consultants, land surveyors, landscape architects, and project managers, as well as errors and omissions insurance to associations and affinity groups, insurance brokers, legal professionals, financial professionals, medical professionals, and not-for-profit organizations.

The company also offers group insurance plans for small to mid-size businesses, with coverage options that include health and dental care, disability insurance, and critical illness insurance.
