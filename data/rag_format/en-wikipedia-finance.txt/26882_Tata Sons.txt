Tata Sons


# Tata Sons



**Tata Sons Pvt. Ltd.** is the holding company of the Tata Group, headquartered in Mumbai. It owns the bulk of shareholding in the Tata group of companies including their land holdings across India, tea estates and steel plants, and derives its revenue from dividends from these companies and brand loyalty fees. Tata Sons is the owner of the Tata name and the Tata trademarks, which are registered in India and several other countries.

Tata Sons was established as a trading enterprise in 1917, and engaged primarily in the overseeing of profits and structuring them into the right direction of the Tata Group, before moving from conducting businesses directly to becoming the principal holding company of Tata Group. About 66% of its equity capital is held by philanthropic trusts endowed by members of the Tata family. The biggest two of these trusts are the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust.


## History

Natarajan Chandrasekaran took over as Chairman of Tata Sons on 21 February 2017. The company also undertook conversion from a public limited company to a private limited one in 2017; both these decisions were challenged in court by former executive chairman Cyrus Mistry.

In December 2019, NCLAT declared the conversion, and by extension, Chandrasekaran's chairmanship, illegal and restored Mistry. On 10 January 2020, however, the Supreme Court stayed NCLAT's order; in response, Mistry filed a cross appeal in the court, seeking explanations for anomalies in the NCLAT. On 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court of India upheld Tata Sons' decision to sack Cyrus Mistry.

In March 2024, speculation arose about Tata Sons preparing for an Initial public offering (IPO), potentially valuing the company at up to $96 billion, according to investment advisory firm Spark.

In November 2024, Tata Sons reached an agreement with Singapore Airlines which saw Indian full-service carrier Vistara merge with Tata-owned Air India to form a single entity with an expanded network and broader fleet.

## Shareholding pattern

Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust are the two biggest shareholders of Tata Sons, with a combined stake of around 50%, while Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry was the largest individual shareholder. Pallonji's father, Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry, was a prominent construction magnate who acquired a significant stake of Tata Sons in the 1930s initially from Framroze Edulji Dinshaw, and finally when JRD Tata's younger brother, Dorab, sold his shares in a fit of anger. Pallonji's shareholding was divided equally between his two sons, Shapoor Mistry and Cyrus Mistry, who died in September 2022.
