In 1933, the company became incorporated as a kabushiki gaisha and was renamed after explorer Henry Morton Stanley, who was famous for exploring Africa. As the company states, Kitano was impressed by Stanley's vision, courage and pioneering spirit. A branch in Osaka was established the following year. From 1943 to 1949, the company was known as Kitano Denki Kogyo Co., Ltd. (北野電気工業株式会社, *Kitano Denki Kōgyō Kabushiki-gaisha*).
