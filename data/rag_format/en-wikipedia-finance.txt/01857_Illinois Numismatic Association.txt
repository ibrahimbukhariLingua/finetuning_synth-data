Illinois Numismatic Association


# Illinois Numismatic Association



The **Illinois Numismatic Association** or **ILNA** is a numismatic state organization based in Illinois since 1959.


## History

The formation of the association first came to be during a meeting at the Peoria Coin Club Show in the Hotel Marriott Pere Marquette in September, 1959. The association hosts a total of 22 different clubs from across Illinois as of 2025. Prior shows have been held in Peoria, Chicago, Centralia, Mattoon, Springfield, LaSalle, Joliet, and Moline. A digest is published by the association four times a year.

In 1999 the ILNA website was chosen to be the site for the official unveiling of the reissued Susan B. Anthony dollar.

The ILNA shows have been held at the Tinley Park Convention Center in Tinley Park since the early 2000s, along with the Greater Chicago Coin & Currency Show. In September 17-19, 2009, the ILNA celebrated their 50th anniversary. That same year the United States Mint began minting the Lincoln Bicentennial cents, so in response the event was largely Abraham Lincoln themed. The convention hosted 220 dealer tables and 1,687 attendees. With even Tinley Park's then mayor Ed Zabrocki and a Lincoln impersonator cutting the ceremonial ribbon.
