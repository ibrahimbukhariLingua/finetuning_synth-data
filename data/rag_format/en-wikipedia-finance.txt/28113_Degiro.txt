**DEGIRO** is a Dutch brokerage company based in Amsterdam. It was founded in 2008 by a group of five former employees of Binck Bank to service the professional market.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## History

DEGIRO was established in 2008. On 23 September 2013, DEGIRO launched its services for retail clients in the Netherlands. In 2014 and 2015, DEGIRO expanded to offer its platform across other European countries.

On 22 September 2014, Euronext announced its partnership with DEGIRO regarding the distribution of retail services of Euronext. Upon publishing the third quarter results for 2014, the partnership was seen as a plan for Euronext to compete more effectively in the Dutch retail segment.

The company launched its English-language platform in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2015.

In December 2019, flatex AG (a German online broker) announced to acquire 100% of DEGIRO, but keep the existing DEGIRO brand. In July 2020, they closed the "transaction of acquiring 100% of DEGIRO shares".


## Regulatory

DEGIRO is supervised by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and under prudential supervision of the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). It is also registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). DEGIRO has previously received criticism from regulators over its business practices and the quality of its IT infrastructure.


## Criticism

The process of internalization of customer's orders against DEGIRO's own hedge fund HiQ Market Neutral fund was subject of investigative press. Clients were denied execution of passive orders, because the internalizer jumped in front of them.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Selling of orders

In June 2021, Dutch state media reported that DEGIRO would start selling customer orders to Tradegate. Dutch regulators did not approve this practice, known as payment for order flow or PFOF. However, following DEGIRO's takeover by German company Flatex, the money of its Dutch customers is now stored on a German bank account. By consequence, DEGIRO's business practices largely fall under German jurisdiction, where the practice is legal.

In an e-mail to its customers, DEGIRO responded that some press coverage had not been accurate. DEGIRO states that the Tradegate deal allows users to trade outside regular opening hours of stock markets. It also notes that users retain full control over whether they send orders to Tradegate.


### Stability of IT infrastructure

In December 2021, the Dutch national bank raised concerns about the technical quality of DEGIRO's IT infrastructure. It had ruled that DEGIRO was insufficiently protected against crashes and hacks. As a result, DEGIRO was ordered to put aside a liquid capital reserve of over 3 million euros.

On multiple occasions, Reddit users have reported being unable to place orders with DEGIRO due to downtime.


### Dividend withholding tax refund

DEGIRO refused requests from Clients to cooperate with their dividend tax refunds. In numerous legally bound cases, a Dutch dispute settlement commission (KiFID) ruled against DEGIRO when it comes to dividend tax withheld by the French Tax Authority. Given the Clients' request does not take excessive amount of work, it concluded cooperation is mandatory on account of reasonableness and fairness. However, a case about the dividend tax withheld by the Swedish Tax Authority was ruled in favor of DEGIRO, because the process required payment information from third parties; thus not being a straightforward administrative task.
