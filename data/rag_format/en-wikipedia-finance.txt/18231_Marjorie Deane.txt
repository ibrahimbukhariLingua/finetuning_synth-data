Marjorie Deane


# Marjorie Deane



**Marjorie Deane** MBE (1914 – 2 October 2008) was a British financial journalist and author, who worked for *The Economist* from 1947 to 1989, and has been called "a pathbreaker for female financial journalists" by Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve.


## Early life

Marjorie Deane was born in 1914 in Manchester. She was educated there at Withington Girls' School, followed by a degree in mathematics at London University.


## Career

During the Second World war, Deane worked as a statistician for the Admiralty, where she reported to the poet John Betjeman, who would become a friend.

Deane worked for *The Economist* from 1947 to 1989, and in the magazine's obituary of Deane, she was described as "the backbone of *The Economist*'s financial coverage". She was initially hired as a statistician, and although *The Economist* were relatively enlightened employers, this did not extend to equal pay in her earlier years; according to the editor Geoffrey Crowther, "You can hire a first-rate woman for the price of a second-rate man".

Deane retired from *The Economist* aged 75, but continued working on a consultancy basis for various employers, and published a book aged 80 with the journalist Robert Pringle, entitled, *The Central Banks*.

Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has called Deane "a pathbreaker for female financial journalists".


## Honours

In 2006, Deane was awarded an MBE, and said to the Queen: "I gather you don't much like us journalists, Ma’am", to which the Queen replied that *financial* journalists were all right.


## Personal life

She died on 2 October 2008, at the age of 94.


## Legacy

In 1998, she put £1 million towards establishing up a foundation to encourage young financial journalists, and most of her estate was added to The Marjorie Deane Financial Journalism Foundation.
