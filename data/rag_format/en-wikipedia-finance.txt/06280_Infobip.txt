## History

Infobip was established by Silvio Kutić, Roberto Kutić and Izabel Jelenić in the Croatian city of Vodnjan in 2006. Before founding Infobip, Silvio Kutić created Virtual Community, that allowed group communication via web, email, and SMS, with the first message sent as a Christmas text from Vodnjan's town hall to its diaspora. Realizing the technology wasn't scalable, he developed a communications API platform, leading to the creation of Infobip.

In 2014 and 2015, the company started its operations in Latin America and Asia-Pacific.

In 2020, Infobip raised $200 million from One Equity Partners. Infobip's valuation thus surpassed $1 billion, making it the first Croatian unicorn company. During the same year, Infobip acquired OpenMarket, a company headquartered in Seattle, United States.
