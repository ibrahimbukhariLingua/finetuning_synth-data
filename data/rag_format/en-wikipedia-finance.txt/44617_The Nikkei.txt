The Nikkei


# The Nikkei



***The Nikkei***, also known as ***The Nihon Keizai Shimbun*** (日本経済新聞, lit. "Japan Economics Newspaper"), is the flagship publication of Nikkei, Inc. (based in Tokyo) and the world's largest financial newspaper, with a daily circulation exceeding 1.73 million copies. The Nikkei 225, a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has been calculated by the newspaper since 1950.

It is one of the four national newspapers in Japan; the other three are *The Asahi Shimbun*, the *Yomiuri Shimbun* and the *Mainichi Shimbun*.


## History

The roots of the Nikkei started with an in-house newspaper department of Mitsui & Company in 1876 when it started publication of *Chugai Bukka Shimpo* (literally *Domestic and Foreign Commodity Price Newspaper*), a weekly market-quotation bulletin. The department was spun out as the *Shokyosha* in 1882. The paper became daily (except Sunday) in 1885 and was renamed *Chugai Shōgyō Shimpo* in 1889. It was merged with *Nikkan Kōgyō* and *Keizai Jiji* and renamed *Nihon Sangyō Keizai Shimbun* in 1942. Its changed its name to the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* in 1946.


## Criticism

According to Shusuke Murai and Reiji Yoshida from *The Japan Times*, critics say the Nikkei is "depending too much on leaks — apparently provided by corporate insiders — and the paper is often seen as reluctant to bluntly criticize Japanese firms." *The New York Times* reporter Hiroko Tabuchi said the Nikkei's purchase of the FT "Worrying", further stating that "[The] Nikkei is basically a PR machine for Japanese biz; it initially ignored the 2011 Olympus accounting scandal (which FT broke). Nikkei has also hardly covered the Takata airbag defect; almost no investigative work on that issue whatsoever. Nikkei is Japan Inc."


## Hong Kong

On August 10, 2020, three Hong Kong Police Force officers visited the Hong Kong branch of *The Nikkei* with a court order amid investigations over an advertisement placed in the newspaper a year prior calling for international support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
