# Takealot.com



**Takealot.com** (stylised as **takealot.com**) is a South African e-commerce company based in Cape Town, South Africa. It is regarded as South Africa's largest online retailer, takealot.com has helped grow online shopping in South Africa, and was the first local retailer to take part in Black Friday.

## History

In October 2010, former MWEB CEO Kim Reid and US-based investment firm Tiger Global Management acquired existing South African ecommerce business Take2, renaming it takealot.com. Takealot.com was officially launched to the public in June 2011.

In 2014, takealot.com successfully launched its own on-demand food delivery service after acquiring Mr Delivery (rebranded *Mr D Food*) and Superbalist.com, a fashion e-tailer which later was acquired by a South African consortium of retail and private equity investors, led by Blank Canvas Capital on September 1, 2024. In the same year, takealot.com announced that a merger would take place with Kalahari.com. The merger was successfully completed in May 2015.
