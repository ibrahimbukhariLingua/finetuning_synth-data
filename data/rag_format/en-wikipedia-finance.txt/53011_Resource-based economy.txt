A **resource-based** or **natural-resource-based economy** is that of a country whose gross national product or gross domestic product to a large extent comes from natural resources.


## Examples

The economies of Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC, countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar are highly dependent on exporting oil and gas.

Suriname's exports of bauxite account for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings.

Of Russian exports, more than 80% are oil, natural gas, metals and timber. Since Russia has a resource-based economy, it depends most of all on the fluctuations of oil and gas demand and prices.

Norway's export of oil and gas forms 45% of total exports and more than 20% of the GDP.
