List of Pakistani administrative units by gross state product


# List of Pakistani administrative units by gross state product



This is a list of Pakistani administrative units by their gross state product (GSP) (the value of the total economy, and goods and services produced in the respective administrative unit) in nominal terms. GSP is the unit-level counterpart of the national gross domestic product (GDP), the most comprehensive measure of a country's economic activity.


## Dynamics

Pakistan, in 2022, had a (GDP nominal) of around US$377 billion and (GDP PPP) of around US$1.512 trillion, according to trading economics. This value can be further divided into the unit levels (GSP), providing an outlook of how much value each unit contributes to the national GDP. Pakistan has traditionally followed a "top-down" approach in its analysis of economic development; that is, authorities have scarcely attempted to break up national GDP statistics into provincial and subnational units and have focused more on the federation as a whole.
Thus, many accounts of provincial GDPs that do exist have usually been projected estimates made by economists, based on the likely percentage of contribution of the respective units to the national GDP and some yearly studies.
Punjab has the largest economy in Pakistan, contributing most to the national GDP. The province's share was 60.58% in 2020 to national economy. Sindh which is the second largest province in terms of population and GDP which has steadily continued to grow, contributes 23.7% to the national economy. It is featured well within the list of country subdivisions with a GDP (PPP) over $200 billion. Sindh's GDP is to a large extent influenced by the economy of Karachi.
