The Devil's Debt


# The Devil's Debt



***The Devil's Debt*** is the fifth studio album by Scottish band Love and Money, released by Vertical in 2012.


## Background

In 2011, Love and Money reunited to perform at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall as part of the Celtic Connections festival, which was followed later in the year with a concert at the SEC Centre. The band's reunion led to the decision to record both new material and some of the songs originally intended for the shelved album *The Mother's Boy*, which was recorded between 1988's *Strange Kind of Love* and 1991's *Dogs in the Traffic*.

*The Devil's Debt* was released in 2012 and reached No. 60 on the Scottish Albums Chart. The title track was released as a single, with a music video produced by the thirteensquared production company. The video was shot at Govanhill Baths and Òran Mór in Glasgow.


## Critical reception

On its release, Alan Morrison of *The Herald* felt the album contained "some of the best songs James Grant and co have ever written" and praised Grant's "deep crooner of a voice". He added: "Personally, I'd rather listen to this than *Strange Kind of Love*".
