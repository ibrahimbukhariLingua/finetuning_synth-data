# Tishman (company)



**THR Management LP**, commonly referred to as **Tishman**, is an American corporation founded in 1898 that owns and develops real estate. The company is best known for being the contractor that built the original World Trade Center in New York City. Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction division of the company, was sold to AECOM in 2010.


## History

Julius Tishman started Julies Tishman and Sons in 1898. As a Polish immigrant, he entered the real estate business by saving enough money to purchase the tenement building where he lived, acquiring additional residential properties and gaining the ability to renovate, lease and finance them independently. The company went public in 1928 as Tishman Realty & Construction, becoming an integrated real estate and construction firm.

Tishman Realty & Construction worked on significant projects around New York in the 1960s and 1970s, including Madison Square Garden and the World Trade Center. This public company liquidated in 1976, selling the Tishman Research and Construction company to Rockefeller Center Inc. The primary shareholders began three separate private companies: a continuation of Tishman Realty & Construction, a real estate development company called Tishman Speyer, and a leasing company called Tishman Management and Leasing Corporation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
