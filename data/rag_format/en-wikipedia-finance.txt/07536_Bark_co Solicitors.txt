# Bark&co Solicitors



**Bark&co** is a boutique law firm headquartered in the City of London, United Kingdom. Since its inception in 1996 it has been a member of the Specialist Fraud Panel and has grown into a top-tier firm in multiple fields. It has represented defendants in several high-profile cases including the largest ever alleged insider dealing case, the Polly Peck International (formerly a constituent of the FTSE100) thefts, and Ian Edmondson in the News International phone hacking scandal.


## Notable cases


### Libor Scandal

Bark&co represented one of six defendants, Noel Cryan, in the Libor scandal. In January 2016 all six defendants were cleared of all charges after a two-year battle and the case banded a "shambles."


### News International phone hacking scandal

Bark&co was instructed by Ian Edmondson, former News of The World Editor, in the News International phone hacking scandal.


### Murder of Daniel Morgan

Bark & Co represented Glenn Vian, who over the course of nearly twenty years has repeatedly been accused of the highly publicised murder of a private investigator in 1987. Mr Vian was eventually charged with this offence in 2008, and held on remand for over two years. The case against Mr Vian was constructed around a number of "supergrass" witnesses" who the defence were, following painstaking work, able to discredit, one by one, until the case ultimately collapsed. During the course of the case preparation, the defence were able to demonstrate over fifty other suspects and motives which the police, over the course of no less than five investigations, failed to investigate either properly or, in multiple cases, at all.


### Murder of Melanie Hall

Bark&co was instructed to represent an alleged suspect in the Murder of Melanie Hall following his arrest in November 2013. Two years later in November 2015, without charge, detectives asked the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision on charging.
