## History

Gulf & Fraser's history extends back to 1940, when a group of BC fishermen incorporated the North Arm Fisherman's Credit Union. Since that time, the credit union has gone through over 30 mergers and many name changes. One of the most significant mergers occurred in 2004 when United Savings Credit Union merged with Gulf and Fraser Fishermen's Credit Union. Another notable merger was with Pioneer Credit Union — the third credit union to be chartered in British Columbia. Pioneer Credit Union was granted charter number 003, which G&F retained for the merged entity.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In November 2023, the credit union announced that a vote to merge with Interior Savings was successful, with a newly branded Beem Credit Union to have combined assets under administration exceeding $10 billion, effective January 1, 2024.
