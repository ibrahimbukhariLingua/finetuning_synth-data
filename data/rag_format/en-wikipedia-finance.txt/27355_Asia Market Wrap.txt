Asia Market Wrap


# Asia Market Wrap



***Asia Market Wrap*** was a business news programme aired on CNBC Asia between 1600 and 1800 (Hong Kong/Singapore time) until December 2005. The show also aired on CNBC US on 5:30 to 6AM ET until 2000, when it was then moved to CNBC World. Anchored by Christine Tan, *Asia Market Wrap* examined the day's headlines and numbers, with in-depth analysis of the day's financial news, interviewing key money managers, market experts and corporate chiefs.

The programme, which came from its original edition on CNBC US, ***Market Wrap***, included several segments, such as *Australia Market Wrap*, *China Business Briefing* and *Eye on India*. ***Asia Market Week*** – a weekly wrap-up of the market action in Asia – aired between 17:30-18:00 on Fridays.

Prior to Martin Soong's original departure from CNBC Asia, he was the programme's regular presenter (the programme was billed as *Asia Market Wrap with Martin Soong*). When he returned to present ***Asia Squawk Box***, Tan was moved to present *Asia Market Wrap* instead.

The programme was not aired on CNBC Asia's CNBC Australia, local opt-out – it was instead replaced by CNBC Europe's *Morning Exchange* (1600–1700 Hong Kong/Singapore Time) and CNBC's ***Wake Up Call*** (1700–1800 Hong Kong/Singapore Time).

The programme ended on 2 December 2005 and was replaced by ***Worldwide Exchange*** on 19 December 2005. Tan continues as the Asian presenter of this programme, joined by CNBC's Michelle Caruso-Cabrera (used for 2005-07-10-19 to due General assignment), now anchored by Brian Shactman (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.
