New Zealand Wool Board


# New Zealand Wool Board



The **New Zealand Wool Board** was established in 1944 under the Wool Industry Act. McKinsey & Company published a report in 2000 that sparked two years of debate for referendums and reforms to the New Zealand Wool Board. In 2001, McKinsey's recommendations were implemented and Wool Board was dissolved and was completely restructured.


## Objective

Its key objective was 'to obtain, in the interests of growers, the best possible returns for New Zealand Wool'.


## Funding

It was funded by a levy on the proceeds of growers' wool sales.
