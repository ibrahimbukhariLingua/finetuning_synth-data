# Zoltan Pozsar



**Zoltan Pozsar** is a Hungarian-American economist known for his analysis of shadow banking.


## Early life and education

Zoltan Pozsar was born in Hungary. He graduated from the University of Pécs and received an MBA from KDI School of Public Policy and Management.


## Career

In 2003, on a recommendation from KDI professor David J. Behling, Pozsar was hired by Mark Zandi of Moody's economy.com as an associate economist, initially charged with covering the recreational goods industry. In January 2006, Pozsar — along with two Moody's colleagues — predicted forecasts for trade gap, industrial production, durable goods orders and personal incomes that were the most accurate of any among major Wall Street analysts that month, earning the trio the MarketWatch Forecaster of the Month award.

He subsequently went to work at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where he led market intelligence for securitized credit markets.

From 2011 to 2012, Pozsar was a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund and, from 2012 to 2015, a senior advisor with the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

In 2015, he left the U.S. Treasury department to join Credit Suisse as a director, and was later promoted to a managing director responsible for the bank's short-term interest rate strategy. At Credit Suisse, Pozsar correctly predicted a major shift in U.S. purchase agreement markets that occurred in 2019.

He left Credit Suisse in May 2023. The following month, he announced the launch of his own advisory firm called Ex Uno Plures, a reversal of the Latin phrase 'e pluribus unum' that means 'out of one, many,' where he would offer clients insight into the dollar system.


### Writing and influence

Pozsar is an influential taxonomist of shadow banking, described by Reuters as a "markets guru", and lauded by Adam Tooze as the Jules Verne of financial forecasting due to what Tooze calls his “brilliant and intellectually fertile” writing. In 2022, the *Financial Times* wrote that Pozsar was the only financier with his own hashtag on social media and that whenever Pozsar "publishes research, the financial corners of Twitter will light up with comments on the latest from #Zoltan". According to the *Wall Street Journal*, Wall Street insiders trade copies of Pozsar's writing "like music fans swapping bootlegs".
