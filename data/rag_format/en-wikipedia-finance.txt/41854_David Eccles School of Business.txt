# David Eccles School of Business



The **David Eccles School of Business** is located on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, Utah. The school was founded as the "School of Commerce & Finance" in 1917 and subsequently changed its name to "School of Business" in 1927, although business classes were taught through the Economics & Sociology department at the University starting in 1896. The school currently offers nine undergraduate majors, four MBA programs, nine specialized master's programs, a Ph.D. program, and executive education offerings. The Eccles School has nearly 40,000 alumni in all 50 U.S. states and many countries.

The Eccles School is also home to several prominent centers and institutes including the Marriner S. Eccles Institute for Economics and Quantitative Analysis, Lassonde Entrepreneur Institute, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute, the Goff Strategic Leadership Center, and the Ivory-Boyer Real Estate Center.


## History

In 1896, University of Utah business education was part of the Economics and Sociology Department. The need to expand academic offerings led the University of Utah to establish the School of Commerce and Finance in 1917. In its first year, 126 students enrolled, and over the next 80 years, the enrollment figure increased over 25 times. Today, the David Eccles School of Business educates more than 4,500 students in six departments of study.

In 1927, the name of the school was changed to "College of Business" and course divisions included Accounting, Distribution and Production, Finance, and Economics. In 1933, the first graduate degrees were awarded. The College of Business was officially accredited by the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business in August 1936. In 1955, the MBA program was instituted at the College of Business. The School's first MBA degrees were awarded in 1957, and its departments were reorganized to Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing.

In 1991, a $15 million endowment was given by David Eccles’ youngest daughter, Emma Eccles Jones, to honor the legacy of her late father. With that gift, the school was renamed to the David Eccles School of Business. David Eccles was a leading pioneer industrialist who, in the latter part of the 19th century, founded 48 businesses in various sectors throughout Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming.
