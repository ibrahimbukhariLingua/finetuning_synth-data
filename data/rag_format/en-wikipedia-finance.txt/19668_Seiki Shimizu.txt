## Awards

## Candlestick technique

The candlestick technique is often used by traders and investors who employ Technical Analysis (TA) to guide and manage their stock and/or commodity positions. This technique of graphically representing movements of a stock or commodity's price dates back to the Japanese rice market of the 17th century. At that time, chartists drew their candlesticks on a scroll of rice paper, from right to left, with a crow quill and India ink ground by hand. These charts provided traders with a sophisticated but quick summary of fluctuations in supply and demand, as well as the emotional and psychological factors at play in the market.
