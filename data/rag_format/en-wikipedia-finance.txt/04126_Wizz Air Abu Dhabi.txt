Wizz Air Abu Dhabi


# Wizz Air Abu Dhabi



**Wizz Air Abu Dhabi** (Arabic: طيران ويز أبو ظبي) is an Emirati low-cost airline based at Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates.


## History

On 12 December 2019, it was announced by Wizz Air that it would be setting up a new subsidiary, based at Zayed International Airport, offering low-cost flights from the airport to tap into growth markets across the Middle East, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. The airline is a joint venture with state-owned Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) (formerly, Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company, ADDH), which owns 51 percent with Wizz Air Holdings owning the remaining 49 percent. Flights began in November 2020 with two Airbus A321neo aircraft, rising to 50 over the next few years.

In July 2020, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi announced its initial route network, launching 6 destinations from its base in Abu Dhabi. In an interview, Jozsef Váradi, CEO of Wizz Air, said that the airline's fleet could grow to 100 aircraft in the next 15 years.

In April 2021, as planned, Wizz Air added Abu Dhabi to its services, offering connections to Europe beyond the UAE to neighbouring Arab countries.
