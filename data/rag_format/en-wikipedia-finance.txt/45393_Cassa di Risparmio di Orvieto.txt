In December 1991, the statutory corporation was split into a limited company (Italian: *Società per Azioni*) and Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Orvieto. The limited company was acquired by Banca CR Firenze in late 1990s and then Banca Popolare di Bari in 2009. Between the two owners, Intesa Sanpaolo also owned the bank from 2007 to 2009 via Banca CR Firenze.
