Musiksverige


# Musiksverige



**Musiksverige** is an economic association and an interest organization that since its inception in 2010 represents artists, songwriters, musicians, managers, producers, record companies and music publishers in Sweden and promotes the issues of these groups.

The organization's three focus areas are copyright, music export and educational issues. Linda Portnoff is head of operations.

The association believes that copyright is a "prerequisite for employment in the creative and cultural industries and for a large and varied range of music" and therefore works to promote it so that "artists, musicians, composers and lyricists can make a living from their profession and record companies and music publishers can create growth through their investments in music".
