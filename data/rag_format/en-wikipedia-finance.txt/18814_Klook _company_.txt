In 2020, Klook shifted its focus from cross-border markets towards domestic markets. The company moved away from traditional day tour products and introduced new services such as "staycations" that bundle hotel stays with additional experiences like restaurants, spa visits, or nearby attractions. Additionally, Klook expanded its mobility options, adding car rental services to its existing intercity train reservations, with a particular emphasis on markets in South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia.

In December 2023, Klook secured US$210 million in a series E+ funding round. The US venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners led the funding round. BPEA EQT, Atinum Investment, and Golden Vision Capital participated in the funding round. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and HSBC provided additional banking facilities.
