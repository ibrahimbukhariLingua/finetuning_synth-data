## Politics

Mhango is involved in national politics in Malawi. He was affiliated with AFORD (Alliance for Democracy). He served as the vice president of the political party under political activists Chakufwa Chihana's presidency. As relations with Chihana became sour due to Chihanas political alliances, he was part of the rift that opposed the leadership to Chihana and boycotted the AFORD convention in 2002. They formed a new political party, Movement for Genuine Democratic Change (Mgode) where he served as the interim chairman. By 2004 however,
it was clear that there was factions in MGODE. The first camp was headed by its Secretary General Greene Rulilo Mwamondwe and MP, Nelson Kampunga Mwafulirwa. The second camp was headed by interim chairman Du Mhango.
The Mwamondwe camp sympathises with National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and held rallies together. The Mhango camp claimed independent of any political alliances and wanted a party ideology dictated by party policy, rather than individual policy. The Mhango camp, wanted to make alliance that served the will of the party.
