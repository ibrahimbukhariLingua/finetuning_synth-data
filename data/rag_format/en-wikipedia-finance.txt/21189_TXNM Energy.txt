### Merger developments with Avangrid

Despite initial rejection by New Mexico regulators, the merger of PNM Resources with Avangrid has progressed favorably. Key factors supporting the likelihood of the deal's eventual approval include changes in the public commission structure and the resolution of legal concerns involving Avangrid's parent company, Iberdrola. The current market scenario reflects a high probability of regulatory approval for the merger. In October 2020, PNM Resources entered into an agreement to be acquired by Avangrid, the US subsidiary of the Spanish multinational electric utility Iberdrola. The deal, valued at $8.3 billion, has received all the necessary approvals except from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). The merger faced initial rejection due to concerns about Avangrid's track record and legal issues involving Iberdrola, leading to an appeal to the Supreme Court. The resolution of these issues is expected within 12–18 months.


## Corporate organization and history

TXNM was founded in 1917 as the Albuquerque Gas and Electric Company. TXNM sold the gas part of the business to Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas in 1949. These sold portions became the Gas Company of New Mexico. In 1985, however, PNM reacquired the Gas Company of New Mexico after Southern Union Gas Company reached a settlement stemming from federal antitrust litigation. In 1994, both electric and gas operations began serving customers as PNM.

In May 2003, TXNM Energy' utility subsidiary, PNM, was recognized by the American Wind Energy Association's Utility Leadership Award for PNM's role in the creation of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center. The award was presented at the National Wind Energy Conference in Austin, Texas.

In 2008, PNM sold New Mexico Gas to Continental Energy, a company backed by the private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg. It was later acquired by TECO Energy. It will soon become a division of Halifax, Canada-based Emera when its acquisition of TECO Energy closes by mid-2016.

On October 21, 2020, the company announced a strategic merger with Avangrid, a subsidiary of Iberdrola.
