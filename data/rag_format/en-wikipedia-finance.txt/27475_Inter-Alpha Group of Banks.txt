Inter-Alpha Group of Banks


# Inter-Alpha Group of Banks



The **Inter-Alpha Group of Banks** was created in 1971 by six banks in the European Community to provide a platform for the regular exchange of ideas and to explore areas for cooperation between its member banks. The group is a non-hierarchical association and is maintained by mutual agreement with each bank retaining full autonomy and independence.

It was one of the banking clubs set up during the 1960s and 1970s when a number of European banks attempted to cooperate at an international level.
