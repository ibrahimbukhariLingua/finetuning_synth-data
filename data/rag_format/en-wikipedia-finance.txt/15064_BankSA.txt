# BankSA



**BankSA**, formerly known as the **Bank of South Australia**, the State Bank of South Australia and the Savings Bank of South Australia is the largest bank in South Australia. It is a subsidiary of Westpac.


## History

The Savings Bank of South Australia was established in the colony of South Australia on 11 March 1848 by sole employee John Hector.The first deposit comprised the life savings of an Afghan shepherd. The first premier of the colony, B. T. Finniss, was a trustee of the bank's inaugural board, and F. H. Robe, Lieutenant Governor of the colony, was president of the bank.

The Savings Bank of South Australia later merged with the former State Bank of South Australia (established 1896), becoming the new State Bank, owned by the Government of South Australia, in 1984.

The State Bank of South Australia was compartmentalised and bought by The Advance Bank due to deteriorating loan book and financial management. Prior to a bailout by the Government of South Australis, the Savings Bank was on the verge of collapse, which was hastened by the 1991 Royal Commission into The Organisation Of Public State Funds of South Australia. Advance Bank was purchased by St. George Bank in 1997 and the State Bank became part of the greater Westpac Corporation after the merger with St. George Bank.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Implications in Royal Commissions

BankSA has not been the subject of Royal Commission findings; however, it did have an indirect history in two separate Royal Commissions. The 1991 Royal Commission in South Australia determined that the State Bank of South Australia had an underperforming loan book due to weak lending rules and operational inefficiencies, which led to a government bailout. As a result, the State Bank of South Australia had to separate and sell off the profitable part of its bank to Advance Bank, which was acquired by Westpac in 2008.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Westpac, was implicated in the Banking Royal Commission of 2017 and was ordered to pay the largest penalty of $1.3 billion for money laundering. BankSA was not directly implicated in any penalty or criminal action.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
