# GE Renewable Energy



**GE Renewable Energy** was a manufacturing and services division of the American company General Electric. It is headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, France and focuses on the production of energy systems that use renewable sources. Its products include wind (onshore and offshore), hydroelectric and solar (concentrated and photovoltaic) power generating facilities.

In 2024, GE Renewable Energy and GE Power merged to create **GE Vernova**, a company completely independent of General Electric, which ceases to exist as a conglomerate (refocusing on aerospace as GE Aerospace).


## History

GE Renewable Energy was created in 2015, combining the wind power assets GE purchased from Alstom with those previously owned by GE and operated under the Power & Water division. Upon the division's creation, the headquarters of GE Renewable Energy moved from Schenectady, New York to Paris, France, part of conditions for the Alstom purchase.

In 2021 plan to splitting GE into three new public companies: GE Vernova, GE HealthCare and GE Aerospace was announced. GE Renewable Energy, along with GE Digital, GE Power, and GE Energy Financial Services will come together as GE Vernova.

In 2023, GE announces planned spin-off date for beginning of second quarter of 2024.
