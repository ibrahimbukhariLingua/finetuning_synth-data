# The Lottery Office



**The Lottery Office** is an Australian online lottery operator licensed by the Government of the Northern Territory and allows Australians and New Zealanders to play to win from the draws of the largest lotteries in the world, including US Powerball and Mega Millions.

### Regulation

In 2014, the Government of the Northern Territory of Australia issued Global Players Network an Internet Gaming Licence, which is licensed in Australia to market international lottery products online. Being the parent company, The Lottery Office is licensed via Global Players Network.

To meet all regulatory requirements set out by the Northern Territory Government, lottery companies regularly undertake financial and operational audits. The Lottery Office additionally receives ongoing and contemporaneous auditing of customer orders against matching tickets purchased, from the Northern Territory Government. Requirements include responsible gambling measures for the safety of all players, enforcement of Australia's gambling age, and features such as weekly deposit limits, self-exclusion and take a break functions.

In June 2018, the Australian Federal Government passed legislation to ban 'lottery betting' under the revised Interactive Gambling Act. It was intended to make it illegal for Australians to bet on the outcome of foreign lotteries, but a case before the Supreme Court of New South Wales ruled that such bets were legal on the basis that the players were betting on an event occurring rather than betting on a game. However, as The Lottery Office does not participate in lottery betting, as it does not allow players to bet on the outcome of a draw, it was not prohibited by the law.
