## Design and construction

Originally the building is owned and developed by Megaworld Corporation, and was known as the World Finance Plaza, but during construction the project was taken over by Union Properties, Inc., the real estate arm of Union Bank of the Philippines, and was renamed "UnionBank Plaza".

UnionBank Plaza was designed by renowned Filipino architectural firm Recio & Casas, with American architectural firm RTKL Associates as its design consultant. The structural design of the building was handled by British engineering group Ove Arup & Partners in cooperation with local engineering group G.E. Origenes & Associates. Project Management was handled by Union Properties, Inc. headed by Arch't. Cynthia V. Razon with her staff, Arch't Contrino del Carmen, Eng'r. Carlo Salvatierra and Arch't Angelo Torres. Construction Management works were undertaken by Jose Aliling & Associates, a well known project management company in the Philippines.

The building has an 8-level concrete podium as its base, while its main body is fully clad with aluminium unitized curtain wall.
