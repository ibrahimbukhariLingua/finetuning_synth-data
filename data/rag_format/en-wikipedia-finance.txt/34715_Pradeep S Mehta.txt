## Career

Mehta's journey with CUTS began in the 80s with the launch of a Hindi monthly wall newspaper known as Gram Gadar. This paper served as a mouthpiece that helped the poor understand the governmental schemes targeted at them. Gram Gadar's success inspired Mehta to expand his focus – he worked towards ensuring the poor have access to basic amenities, education and equal rights.

Today, CUTS International has a major presence in India through centres that help resolve developmental challenges faced by societies. The organisation also has a presence in Switzerland, Vietnam, Ghana, Kenya, Zambia and the US.
