## History

Rue du Commerce was co-founded in August 1999 by Patrick Jacquemin and Gauthier Picquart. To create “Rue du Commerce,” the co-founders were inspired by Amazon, the classified ads site Figaro Classifieds|Classified, and the auction site eBay.

In June 2006, the after-sales service obtained ISO 9001 certification (quality management system), becoming the first French website to obtain this label.

In March 2009, Rue du Commerce acquired its competitors Top Achat and Clust from France Telecom E-Commerce.

In November 2011, Rue du Commerce was acquired by Altarea Cogedim through a friendly takeover, while the company was generating a business volume of €420 million and a turnover of €316 million.

In 2014, Rue du Commerce employed 373 people and launched a marketplace powered by Mirakl.

In January 2016, Rue du Commerce was acquired by the Carrefour Group, the French leader in retail, for an estimated value between €20 and €30 million. Following this acquisition, Rue du Commerce replaced Carrefour's online sales site, Carrefour Online.
