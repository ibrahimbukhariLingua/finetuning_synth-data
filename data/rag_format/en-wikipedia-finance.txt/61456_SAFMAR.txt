The Group includes oil producing, oil processing, coal and potash companies, financial assets, retail chains, construction and development holdings, companies engaged in commercial property management, logistics centers, hotels, media resources among which are radio stations and TV channels.


## History

Safmar Group was established by Mikhail Gutseriev, a Russian entrepreneur. The name SAFMAR derives from the first letters of his parents’ names Safarbek and Marem. Industrial companies owned by Mr. Gutseriev appeared to be the cornerstone of the Group. Their dynamic development allowed allocating the funds for the purchase of the new assets in different sectors thus leading to business diversification. This portfolio of assets required efficient management for which a joint stock company Safmar Group was incorporated. Mikhail Gutseriev is the Chairman of the Group's Board of Directors and he determines the conglomerate's development strategy.

In 2019 two major industrial companies were included into SAFMAR Group. In April the holding purchased Afipsky oil refinery, and in October SAFMAR became the major shareholder in Kuzbasskaya Toplivnaya Company PJSC.

In September 2019 SAFMAR Industrial and Financial Group was inсluded into RBK 500 top list, being the 9th among the major state and private corporations of Russia. In 2020, the group confirmed its positions in this rating, and also entered the top 10 list of the largest 400 companies in Russia according to the Expert media holding. The Safmar group demonstrated similar results in 2021.

Forbes Russia ranked the Gutseriev family as the leader among the richest Russian families with their US$5.65 bn common fortune.


## Courts

In October 2019 Forbes Russia published the article about a trillion debt of the Gutseriev family and Mr. Shishkhanov, his nephew, found by Trust, the bank of “toxic” assets. Safmar said this information was “fake news” and “a perfect example of the most corrupted and cheapest yellow press”, the company also reported some pieces of information were “far-fetched” and “invented”, along with that Safmar did not exclude the defamation action. In the end the defamation action against Safmar was executed by Forbes Russia publisher. On the 10th of December Safmar and Mikhail Gutseriev filed a claim against the magazine to the Arbitration Court of Moscow requiring to delete the article. In December 2019, the editors of the magazine removed the material from the publication's website, recognizing it as erroneous, and the dispute was settled out of court.
