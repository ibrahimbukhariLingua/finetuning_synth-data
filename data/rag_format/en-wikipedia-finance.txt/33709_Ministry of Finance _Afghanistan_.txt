## History

During the reign of Ahmad Shah Baba, when greater importance was given to financial matters, the foundation of a branch called Humayun Aala (present-day Ministry of Finance) was first laid in 1140 AD along with other affairs and structures of the state and its affairs were carried out with the permission of Sardar Abdullah Khan Popalzi who was the first finance minister. At that time he was also given the name Dewan Begi. Over time, the title of Dewan Begi was changed to Mustafi Al Malik and his name was the same as that of the current Ministry of Finance. Mustafi al-Malik used his power to coordinate and supervise everyone's financial and accounting affairs of all provinces.
Under king Habibullah Khan the tax base was small and the majority of Afghans did not accept the system in place. After achieving independence and reform of administrative military organization, the new Ministry of Finance was established. “Later, in 1965 the financial systems were developed and officially introduced in Afghanistan.” According to the requirements and needs of Afghan financial system the ministry of Finance has following structure: Ministry, Deputy Administrative, Financial Deputy, Deputy Revenue and Customs, and Deputy Policy.
