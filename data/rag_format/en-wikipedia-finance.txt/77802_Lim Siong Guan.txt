## Honour (Singapore)

In August 2014, Lim founded Honour Singapore, a non-profit organisation advocating a culture of honour, as founding chairman. It attracted scrutiny on social media when it was revealed that all the original members of the board are also senior members of the Full Gospel Business (FGB) Singapore, a group that believes in bringing the Christian teachings to the "marketplace" and all levels of society.

Lim denied categorically that Honour Singapore had Christian inclination, and that Honour Singapore and FGB Singapore share the same office for convenience. The organisation has since added Mohammad Alami Musa, non-executive President of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, to its board in 2016.
