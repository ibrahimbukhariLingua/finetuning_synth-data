The Black Wall Street Records


# The Black Wall Street Records



**The Black Wall Street Records** was a record label founded by Jayceon "Game" Taylor and George "Big Fase 100" Taylor III.


## History

The name "The Black Wall Street" is adopted from what was the racially segregated Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa, Oklahoma. During the oil boom of the 1920s, Greenwood was home to several successful and prominent African-American entrepreneurs.

Before The Documentary, Game dropped a series of mixtapes on his own label, The Black Wall Street. After leaving G-Unit Records, Game hoped to push The Black Wall Street to the mainstream to compete with his former label and labelmates. Big Fase 100 eventually left the label officially after internal problems with Game. Though the company hasn't released an official retail album, it has released several mixtapes including the "Black Wall Street Journal" and "BWS Radio" series. Former artists who have been on the label include: Eastwood, Techniec, Cyssero, Vita, Ya Boy, and Charli Baltimore.
