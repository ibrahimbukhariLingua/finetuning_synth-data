ISO 4217


# ISO 4217



**ISO 4217** is a standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that defines alpha codes and numeric codes for the representation of currencies and provides information about the relationships between individual currencies and their minor units. This data is published in three tables:

* Table A.1 – *Current currency & funds code list*
* Table A.2 – *Current funds codes*
* Table A.3 – *List of codes for historic denominations of currencies & funds*

The first edition of ISO 4217 was published in 1978. The tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by SIX Group on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.

The ISO 4217 code list is used in banking and business globally. In many countries, the ISO 4217 alpha codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to delineate the currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols. ISO 4217 alpha codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.


## History

In 1973, the ISO Technical Committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of currencies and funds for use in any application of trade, commerce or banking. At the 17th session (February 1978), the related UN/ECE Group of Experts agreed that the three-letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217, "Codes for the representation of currencies and funds", would be suitable for use in international trade.

Over time, new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued. Such changes usually originate from the formation of new countries, treaties between countries on shared currencies or monetary unions, or redenomination from an existing currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the list of codes must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency is responsible for maintaining the list of codes.


## Types of codes


### National currencies

In the case of national currencies, the first two letters of the alpha code are the two letters of the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code and the third is usually the initial of the currency's main unit. So Japan's currency code is JPY: "JP" for Japan and "Y" for yen. This eliminates the problem caused by the names *dollar*, *franc*, *peso*, and *pound* being used in dozens of countries, each having significantly differing values. While in most cases the ISO code resembles an abbreviation of the currency's full English name, this is not always the case, as currencies such as the Algerian dinar, Aruban florin, Cayman dollar, renminbi, sterling, and the Swiss franc have been assigned codes which do not closely resemble abbreviations of the official currency names.

In some cases, the third letter of the alpha code is not the initial letter of a currency unit name. There may be a number of reasons for this:

* It is considered important that the code of a completely new currency be highly mnemonic if possible. An example is the assignment of the code EUR to the euro. ISO 4217 amendment 94, which created this code, states "The code element 'EU' has been reserved by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency for use within ISO 4217 where 'R' has been appended to make an acceptable mnemonic code." Here the R comes from the third letter in the word "euro".
* The currency in question is replacing another currency of the same name, due to revaluation. So that the two currencies have different codes, a different third letter must be chosen for the code of the new currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for "new" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term "new" itself (for example, the code for the Mexican peso is MXN, reflecting its 1993 revaluation). Another solution to a revalued currency having the same name as its predecessor is to choose a third letter which results in a 3-letter code with mnemonic significance. For example, the Russian ruble changed from RUR to RUB following a revaluation, where the B comes from the third letter in the word "ruble".ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### X currencies (funds, precious metals, supranationals, other)

In addition to codes for most active national currencies ISO 4217 provides codes for "supranational" currencies, procedural purposes, and several things which are "similar to" currencies:

* Codes for the precious metals gold (XAU), silver (XAG), palladium (XPD), and platinum (XPT) are formed by prefixing the element's chemical symbol with the letter "X". These "currency units" are defined as one troy ounce of the specified metal.
* The code XTS is reserved for use in testing.
* The code XXX is used to denote a "transaction" involving no currency.
* There are also codes specifying certain monetary instruments used in international finance, e.g. XDR is the symbol for special drawing right issued by the International Monetary Fund.
* The codes for most supranational currencies, such as the East Caribbean dollar, the CFP franc, the CFA franc BEAC, and the CFA franc BCEAO. The predecessor to the euro, the European Currency Unit (ECU), had the code XEU.

The use of an initial letter "X" for these purposes is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official country code beginning with X will ever be assigned.

The inclusion of EU (denoting the European Union) in the ISO 3166-1 reserved codes list allows the euro to be coded as EUR rather than assigned a code beginning with X, even though it is a supranational currency.


### Numeric codes

ISO 4217 also assigns a three-digit numeric code to each currency. This numeric code is usually the same as the numeric code assigned to the corresponding country by ISO 3166-1. For example, USD (United States dollar) has numeric code 840 which is also the ISO 3166-1 code for "US" (United States).

### Historical codes

A number of currencies had official ISO 4217 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by another currency. The table below shows the ISO currency codes of former currencies and their common names (which do not always match the ISO 4217 names). That table has been introduced end 1988 by ISO.

## Currency details


### Minor unit fractions

The 2008 (7th) edition of ISO 4217 says the following about minor units of currency:

> Requirements sometimes arise for values to be expressed in terms of minor units of currency. When this occurs, it is necessary to know the decimal relationship that exists between the currency concerned and its minor unit. This information has therefore been included in this International Standard and is shown in the column headed "Minor unit" in Tables A.1 and A.2; "0" means that there is no minor unit for that currency, whereas "1", "2" and "3" signify a ratio of 10:1, 100:1 and 1000:1 respectively. The names of the minor units are not given.

Examples for the ratios of 100:1 and 1000:1 include the United States dollar and the Bahraini dinar, for which the column headed "Minor unit" shows "2" and "3", respectively. As of 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, two currencies have non-decimal ratios, the Mauritanian ouguiya and the Malagasy ariary; in both cases the ratio is 5:1. For these, the "Minor unit" column shows the number "2". Some currencies, such as the Burundian franc, do not in practice have any minor currency unit at all. These show the number "0", as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to negligible value.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Code position in amount formatting

The ISO standard does not regulate either the spacing, prefixing or suffixing in usage of currency codes. The style guide of the European Union's Publication Office declares that, for texts issued by or through the Commission in English, Irish, Latvian, and Maltese, the ISO 4217 code is to be followed by a "hard space" (non-breaking space) and the amount:

and for texts in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish the order is reversed; the amount is followed by a non-breaking space and the ISO 4217 code:

As illustrated, the order is determined not by the currency but by the native language of the document context.


### USD, USN: two US currency codes

The US dollar has two codes assigned: USD and USN ("US dollar next day"). The USS (same day) code is not in use any longer, and was removed from the list of active ISO 4217 codes in March 2014.


## Non ISO 4217 currencies


### Currencies without ISO 4217 currency codes

A number of active currencies do not have an ISO 4217 code, because they may be:

1. a minor currency pegged at par (1:1) to a larger currency, even if independently regulated,
2. a currency only used for commemorative banknotes or coins, or
3. a currency of an unrecognized or partially recognized state.

These currencies include:

* Abkhazian apsar (state of issue is viewed as *de jure* part of Georgia)
* Alderney pound (1:1 pegged to sterling)
* Artsakh dram
* Cook Islands dollar (1:1 pegged to the New Zealand dollar)
* Faroese króna (1:1 pegged to the Danish krone)
* Guernsey pound (1:1 pegged to sterling)
* Isle of Man pound (1:1 pegged to sterling)
* Jersey pound (1:1 pegged to sterling)
* Kiribati dollar (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar)
* Maltese scudo (1:0.24 pegged to the euro) (Currency of the Sovereign Order of Malta; the Republic of Malta uses the euro.)
* Real Time Gross Settlement dollar (ZWL occasionally used)
* Sahrawi peseta (pegged to the euro), sometimes given the code "EHP" but this has not been assigned by the ISO
* Somaliland shilling (state of issue is viewed as *de jure* part of Somalia, exchange rate not fixed)
* Transnistrian ruble (state of issue is viewed as *de jure* part of Moldova)
* Tuvaluan dollar (1:1 pegged to the Australian dollar)
* Zimbabwean bonds

See Category:Fixed exchange rate for a list of all currently pegged currencies.


### Non-standard codes

Despite having no presence or status in the standard, three letter acronyms that resemble ISO 4217 coding are sometimes used locally or commercially to represent *de facto* currencies or currency instruments.


Active abbreviations resembling ISO 4217 currency codes
| Unofficial code | ISO 4217 code | D | Currency | Locations using this currency | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BDS | BBD | 2 | Barbados dollar | Barbados | The Government of Barbados and Central Bank of Barbados sometimes use the abbreviation "BDS" rather than the official ISO 4217 "BBD". BDS conflicts with ISO 4217, because BD is reserved for Bangladesh. |
| CNH | — | 2 | Renminbi (offshore) | Hong Kong | The code CNH is used to represent the Renminbi in offshore trading, especially offshore trading involving **H**ong Kong. See Offshore Renminbi (CNH). The USD/CNY rate and the USD/CNH rate are, usually, different. |
| CNT | — | 2 | Renminbi (offshore) | Taiwan | The code CNT is used to represent the Renminbi in offshore trading, especially offshore trading involving **T**aiwan. See Other markets. |
| GGP | — | 2 | Guernsey pound | Guernsey |
| IMP | — | 2 | Manx pound | Isle of Man |
| JEP | — | 2 | Jersey pound | Jersey |
| KID | — | 2 | Kiribati dollar | Kiribati |
| NIS | ILS | 2 | Israeli shekel | Israel | NIS stands for ***N**ew **I**sraeli **S**hekel*, the currency that replaced the first Israeli shekel due to hyperinflation. NIS conflicts with ISO 4217, because NI stands for Nicaragua. |
| NTD | TWD | 2 | New Taiwan dollar | Taiwan |
| PRB | — | 2 | Transnistrian ruble | Transnistria | Transnistria is an unrecognised state and is *de facto* rather than *de jure* independent. PRB conflicts with ISO 4217, because PR stands for Puerto Rico. |
| SLS | — | 2 | Somaliland shilling | Somaliland | Somaliland is an unrecognised state and is *de facto* rather than *de jure* independent. SLS conflicts with ISO 4217, because SL stands for Sierra Leone. |
| STG | GBP | 2 | Sterling | United Kingdom | STG stands for ***ST**erlin**G***, the official name of the United Kingdom's currency, of which the pound is the main unit. While not an ISO code, "STG" is nonetheless the CHAPS real-time gross settlement and clearing code for sterling recognized by SWIFT. It is listed in ISO 20022 as a registered external code used by SWIFT. STG conflicts with ISO 4217, because ST stands for São Tomé and Príncipe. |
| RMB | CNY | 2 | Renminbi | Mainland China | RMB stands for ***R**en**M**in**B**i*, the official name of the Chinese currency, of which the yuan is the main unit. RMB conflicts with ISO 4217 because RM is reserved for Madagascar. |
| TVD | — | 2 | Tuvalu dollar | Tuvalu | TV is the ISO 3166 two-letter code for Tuvalu |
| ZWB | — | 2 | Zimbabwean bonds | Zimbabwe | Also known as the RTGS Dollar. |

The following non-ISO codes were used in the past.

Historical non-ISO 4217 currency codes

| ARL | ARY | 2 | Argentine peso ley | Argentina | Used from January 1970 to May 1983, when it was replaced by the Argentine peso argentino (ARP). |
| MAF | — | 2 | Malian franc | Mali | Used from 1962 to 1984. The code MAF was formerly noted in ISO 4217, but was amended to MLF on 2007-06-18. |
| MCF | — | 2 | Monégasque franc | Monaco | Used until January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (EUR). |
| MKN | — | first denar | North Macedonia | Used from January 1990 through 1993, when it was replaced by the second denar (MKD). |
| SML | — | 0 | San Marinese lira | San Marino | Used until January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (EUR). |
| VAL | — | 0 | Vatican lira | Vatican City | Used until January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (EUR). |
| YUG | — | 2 | Yugoslav dinar | Yugoslavia | Re-denomination used in January 1994 until it was replaced by the novi dinar (YUM). |
| YUO | — | 2 | Yugoslav dinar | Yugoslavia | Re-denomination used from October–December 1993, when it was again re-denominated (YUG). |
| YUR | — | 2 | Reformed Yugoslav dinar | Yugoslavia | Revaluation used from July 1992 to September 1993 until re-denomination (YUO). |


### Unofficial codes for minor units of currency

Minor units of currency (also known as currency subdivisions or currency subunits) are often used for pricing and trading stocks and other assets, such as energy, but are not assigned codes by ISO 4217. Two conventions for representing minor units are in widespread use:

* Replacing the third letter of the ISO 4217 Code of the parent currency with an upper-case "X". Examples are GBX for penny sterling, USX for the US Cent, EUX for the Euro Cent.
* Replacing the third letter of the ISO 4217 Code of the parent currency with the first letter of the name of a minor unit, using lower-case. Examples are GBp for Penny Sterling, USc for the US Cent, and EUc for the Euro Cent.

A third convention is similar to the second one but uses an upper-case letter, e.g. ZAC for the South African Cent.


### Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies have *not* been assigned an ISO 4217 code. However, some cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges use a three-letter acronym that resemble an ISO 4217 code.
