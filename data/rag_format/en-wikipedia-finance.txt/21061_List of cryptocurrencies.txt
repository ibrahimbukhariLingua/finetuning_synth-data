# List of cryptocurrencies



Since the creation of bitcoin in 2009, the number of new cryptocurrencies has expanded rapidly.

The UK's Financial Conduct Authority estimated there were over 20,000 different cryptocurrencies by the start of 2023, although many of these were no longer traded and would never grow to a significant size.

Active and inactive currencies are listed in this article.
