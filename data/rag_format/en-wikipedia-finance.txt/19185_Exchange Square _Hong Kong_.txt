# Exchange Square (Hong Kong)



**Exchange Square** (Chinese: 交易廣場; Jyutping: *gaau1 jik6 gwong2 coeng4*) is a building complex located in Central, Hong Kong. It houses offices and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It is served by the Central and Hong Kong stations of the MTR metro system.

Most of the Exchange Square is owned by Hong Kong Land, with the remaining portion owned by the Government. The building has three blocks, namely, *One Exchange Square*, *Two Exchange Square* and *Three Exchange Square*. A shopping block known as *The Forum* was redeveloped as an office building in 2011–14.

The ground level houses a large bus terminus, Central (Exchange Square) Bus Terminus.

## Plot

Hong Kong Land tendered the government HK$4.76 billion for the plot in February 1982, when the market was at a record high. Prices subsequently dropped, necessitating its debt to be restructured. In February 1983, HKL obtained an eight-year loan of HK$4 billion, a record. In December 1983, it announced that the plot was to be mortgaged to secure a HK$2.5 billion loan facility. The second instalment of HK$2 billion on the plot was due in the financial year 1984/85.



## Phase three

Development cost HK$750m, 32-storey 322,000-square-foot (29,900 m²) office tower, 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m²) mall, substructure contractor Gammon Hong Kong.


## The Forum

*The Forum* (Chinese: 富臨閣) was a shopping complex at the podium level. From 2011 to 2014, it was redeveloped into a seven-storey office building with a floor area of 4,460 sq m. It is wholly occupied by Standard Chartered Bank. The plaza outside the forum includes a landscaped roof garden, stepped terraces and fountains, and a collection of sculptures by artists such as Henry Moore, Ju Ming and Dame Elizabeth Frank.
