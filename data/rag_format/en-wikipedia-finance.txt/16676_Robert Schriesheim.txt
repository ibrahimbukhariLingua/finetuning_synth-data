GTS had revenues of over $1 billion and operations in 20 countries in Europe as well as a NASDAQ-listed subsidiary, Golden Telecom, which held communications assets in Russia. GTS was a portfolio of communications assets in Western and Eastern Europe which went through an IPO in 1998. It subsequently experienced challenges with an over-levered balance sheet as Europe went through deregulation of the communications industry and was impacted by the dot.com downturn. In 2001, to facilitate the sale, GTS undertook a pre-arranged filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (U.S.B.C.) and, in prearranged proceedings, a petition for surseance (moratorium), offering a composition, in the Netherlands to restructure its debt, in excess of $2 billion.

Earlier in his career he was affiliated with Brooke Group, a Leveraged buyout firm controlled by Bennett S. LeBow. Investor Bennett S. LeBow acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that included the concurrent acquisition of the international telex operations of ITT as part of a complex leveraged recapitalization that was financed by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken in a process that included many prominent investors who had also attempted to acquire control including Richard Rainwater and Jay Pritzker. LeBow installed Schriesheim at Western Union from 1987 to 1990 as a special adviser to CEO Robert J. Amman to help oversee a restructuring of the company. They executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services into a provider of consumer-based money transfer financial services and divested the company's telecommunications assets. Ultimately, LeBow's $25 million investment to acquire control of Western Union in 1987 was rewarded when the company was acquired by First Financial Management in 1993 for $1.15 billion also making Carl Icahn a return of 3 to 4 times his investment in the bonds in the process. First Financial Management was subsequently acquired in 1995 by First Data Corp in a $6.6 billion merger.
