## History

Real estate agent Ken D'Angelo founded HomeVestors of America in 1996 and began franchising that same year. By the end of that year, it had 17 franchisees and generated about $800,000 in revenue. It also sold its 25,000th house, in Jonesboro, GA. Franchisees hold the homes for six months on average.

**1997**

In 1997, HomeVestors reached 30 franchises with $1.7 million in revenue.

**2003**

By 2003, HomeVestors had grown to 135 offices in 17 states. In February 2004, the company signed an agreement with The Home Depot, making the hardware company its official provider of building materials.

**2004**

In July 2004, the company launched a real estate-owned (REO) program. HomeVestors purchased single-family houses from its franchisees and called them "ugly notes". They were then sold to third party note purchasers. By the end of 2004 the firm had moved to a larger headquarters. A new mascot was launched, “UG” the Caveman. The company added an additional advertising slogan, "UG Buys Ugly Houses," and both mascot and slogan appeared on new billboards and TV commercials.

In 2004, Ken D'Angelo was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and in September 2004 national franchise consultant John Hayes took over as president and CEO. D'Angelo died on January 8, 2005.

**2007-2009**

After the slowdown in housing sales due to the United States sub-prime mortgage crisis, the firm marketed its services to financially distressed home owners who were facing foreclosures and looking for a quick sale. Holding company Franchise Brands LLC acquired majority interest of the firm on June 11, 2008.

On February 7, 2018, HomeVestors purchased its 85,000th house since its incorporation in 1996. .

HomeVestors passed hands again on April 27, 2017, when it was purchased by the Los Angeles-based private equity firm Levine Leichtman Capital Partners and Management.


## Proprietary Tools

The company provides franchisees with a proprietary software system, ValueChek, to evaluate single-family homes for repair costs and after-repair market value of a property.

The firm, in conjunction with Local Market Monitor, maintained a set of "Best Markets to Invest in Rental Property" rankings, to forecast expected performance of rental properties, particularly single-family homes.


## Criticism

According to a 2023 investigation by Propublica, many HomeVestors franchisees "used deception and targeted the elderly, infirm and those so close to poverty that they feared homelessness would be a consequence of selling." The company said in response that such deals represent a small share of all transactions.


## Awards

On October 15, 2018, Franchising Times again named HomeVestors the "third fastest-growing franchise in America."
