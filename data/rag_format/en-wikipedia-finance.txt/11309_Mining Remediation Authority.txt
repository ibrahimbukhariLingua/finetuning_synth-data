Mining Remediation Authority


# Mining Remediation Authority



The **Mining Remediation Authority** is a non-departmental public body of the United Kingdom government sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). It owns the vast majority of unworked coal in Great Britain, as well as former coal mines, and undertakes a range of functions including:

* licensing coal mining operations
* matters with respect to coal mining subsidence damage outside the areas of responsibility of coal mining licensees
* dealing with property and historical liability issues; for example environmental projects, mine water treatment schemes and surface hazards relating to past coal mining
* providing public access to information held by the Mining Remediation Authority on coal mining

The Mining Remediation Authority changed its public name from the **Coal Authority** in November 2024. As of 2025ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the Coal Authority remains the legal name of the organisation, as set by law.


## Purpose

The Mining Remediation Authority’s stated purpose is to:

* keep people safe and provide peace of mind

The Mining Remediation Authority provides services to other government departments and agencies, local governments and commercial partners, while contributing to the delivery of the government’s Industrial Strategy and the 25-year Environment Plan.

As a public body that holds significant geospatial data it is also working with the Geospatial Commission to look at how, by working together, it can unlock significant value across the economy.

As part of the Mining Remediation Authority's duty to protect the public and the environment, it operates a 24-hour telephone line for reporting coal mine hazards and operates 82 mine water treatment schemes across the UK, cleaning more than 122 billion litres of mine water every year.


## Governance and strategy

The Mining Remediation Authority has an independent board responsible for setting its strategic direction, policies and priorities, while ensuring its statutory duties are carried out effectively.
Non-executive directors are recruited and appointed to the board by the Secretary of State for DESNZ. Executive directors are recruited to their posts by the board and appointed to the board by the Secretary of State for DESNZ.


## History

It was established under the **Coal Industry Act 1994** (c. 21) to manage some functions, in which the British Coal Corporation (formerly the National Coal Board) had previously undertaken, including ownership of unworked coal. In November 2024, the organisation's name was changed from the Coal Authority to the Mining Remediation Authority to "better reflect the organisation’s 24/7 role to manage the effects of historical mining in England, Scotland and Wales and its work to seek low-carbon opportunities from our mining heritage for the future."

The Mining Remediation Authority's public task comprises all the functions, duties and responsibilities is set out in the following documents

* The Coal Industry Act 1994 ("the 1994 act")
* The Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991, as amended by the 1994 act
* A Revised Coal Authority Explanatory Note, produced by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) for Parliament in June 1994 to explain the intended provisions of the Coal Industry Bill
* The Water Act 2003
* The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003
* Statement by Lord Strathclyde in 1994 on the government's expectations of the Coal Authority relating to mine water remediation
* Re-statement by John Battle MP in 1998 that the Coal Authority was the designated body with responsibility for dealing with mine water discharges from former coal minesᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ
* The Energy Act 2011

Its headquarters are in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where its Mining Heritage Centre is also based. This archive houses a large quantity of data, including historical information, relating to coal mining in Britain.

The unique collection of around 120,000 coal abandonment plans, covering both opencast and deep mining operations, dates as far back as the 17th century and depict areas of extraction and the point of entry into the same.

Historical mine plans can be accessed for research purposes, for desktop studies prior to development or simply by members of the public with an interest in the history of mining.

The Mining Remediation Authority also has a large collection of more than 47,000 British Coal photographs, which feature a wide range of collieries and cover every aspect of coal mining.

All plans and photographs have been digitally scanned and are available to any interested parties. They can be viewed at the Mining Heritage Centre in Mansfield.


## The Water and Abandoned Metal Mines (WAMM) programme

To tackle the water pollution caused by historical metal mining in England, the Mining Remediation Authority works with the Environment Agency in the Water and Abandoned Metal Mines partnership, funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).


## Mining reports

The Mining Remediation Authority’s Commercial Reports and Advisory Services provides comprehensive mining report services, include desktop reports, pre planning advice, project management and civil, structural and environmental engineering. Reports available include:

* Enviro All-in-One report – a CON29M report, combined with Groundsure’s homebuyers environmental report
* Consultants Coal Mining report - builds on information in a CON29M report, giving additional details such as seam names and depths. Aimed towards mining consultants
* No Search Certificate – a certificate to show that a property is not within a known area of past, present or proposed future mining activity

## Mine energy and heat

Abandoned coal mines are a source of geothermal energy, and could also be used for cooling and storing inter-seasonally waste or renewable energy.

As mines become flooded they have the potential to meet all of the heating needs of the coalfield communities which account for 25% of UK population. In the case of a district heating network, this energy can be transferred to a pipe network using a heat exchanger, and then distributed to nearby homes.

Abandoned coal mines present an opportunity to the UK as a source of geothermal energy, and this is being explored by the Mining Remediation Authority, which is working in partnerships with local authorities and other companies to fulfil this potential.
