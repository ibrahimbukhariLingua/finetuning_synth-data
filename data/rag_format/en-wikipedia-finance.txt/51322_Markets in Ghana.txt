Markets in Ghana


# Markets in Ghana



**Markets** are essential to the Economy of Ghana


## History of markets

Trading in the country begun when the first settlers arrived in the region. Like many countries in Africa, the main method of trading was through the barter system. People used to exchange goods and services for commodities and services that was believed to measure up to what was being offered. As trade became more liberalized, people used to trade their goods and services for cowries known locally as "cedie". This later became the country's currency - the cedi.
