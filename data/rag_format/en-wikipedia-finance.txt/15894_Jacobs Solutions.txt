## Controversies


### Kingston coal ash cleanup

The Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill was an environmental and industrial disaster that occurred on Monday December 22, 2008, when a dike ruptured at a coal ash pond at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County, Tennessee, releasing 1.1 billion U.S. gallons (4.2 million cubic meters) of coal fly ash slurry. TVA hired Jacobs Engineering to clean up the spill. In the years following the spill at the cleanup site, a number of workers suffered health effects.

As early as 2012, workers began to report illnesses that they believed were caused by the cleanup, and by the ten year anniversary of the event, hundreds of workers had been sickened and more than 30 had died. In May 2023, it was reported that more than 50 workers had died and 150 were sick.

In 2013, 50 workers and their families filed a lawsuit against contractor Jacobs Engineering. They were represented by Knoxville lawyer James K. Scott. This lawsuit was dismissed by judge Thomas A. Varlan, chief justice for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee the following year. This ruling was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit after evidence was discovered that Jacobs Engineering had misled the workers about the dangers of coal ash.

A federal jury ruled in favor of the workers seeking compensation in November 2018. The ruling held that Jacobs Engineering had failed to keep the workers safe from environmental hazards, and had misled them about the dangers of coal ash, mainly by claiming that extra protective equipment, such as masks and protective clothing, was unnecessary.

In a phase two of the trial, the Kingston cleanup workers will be able to seek damages. In April 2020, 52 workers rejected a $10 million settlement offered by Jacobs Engineering.


### Hinkley Point

Jacobs Engineering is constructing the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor, controversial for the reason of its excessive delays and cost overruns. “It’s three times over cost and three times over time where it’s been built in Finland and France,” said Paul Dorfman of UCL Energy Institute. The companies involved have been accused of a conflict of interest as the company advising the UK about cost management was owned by Jacobs Engineering, while Jacobs was working for the company managing the project EDF. In other words, a subsidiary of a company hired by EDF was advising the UK how much money to grant EDF.


### Woonsocket Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management is investigating this Jacobs-run plant for spillage of an estimated 10 million gallons of wastewater with incomplete treatment into the Blackstone River in June 2022. Previous investigations resulted in letters of noncompliance issued to Jacobs in 2021 and 2020.
