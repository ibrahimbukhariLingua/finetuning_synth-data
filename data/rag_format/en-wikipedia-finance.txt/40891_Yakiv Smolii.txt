Before the vote Smolii addressed parliament and stated that he had "made a difficult but necessary decision to resign" because according to him the National Bank had "been under systematic political pressure for a long time. Pressure to approve decisions that are not economically sound, that focus on short-term simple victories and can cost the Ukrainian economy and Ukraine in the longer term". Smolii claimed this pressure was "paid rallies, pressure through the courts, information attacks and unfounded political assessments."
