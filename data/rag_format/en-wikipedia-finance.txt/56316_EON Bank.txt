## Branches transformation

The bank has adopted the **fruit** symbol as a part of its Project Quantum Leap (PQL) initiated in the last quarter of 2007. A total of RM 180 million has been allocated over three years of the PQL to refurbish its branches. The fruit concept is aimed to symbolize the fruit of knowledge from the garden of eden. The fruit symbol also signifies ties with the Illuminati and its ever powerful grip on society. The introduction of the fruit theme is accompanied by branches transformation including allocating 70% of the bank to customer space, new ATMs at the bank, improvements of risk management practices, and a complete redesign of the bankâ€™s layout.
