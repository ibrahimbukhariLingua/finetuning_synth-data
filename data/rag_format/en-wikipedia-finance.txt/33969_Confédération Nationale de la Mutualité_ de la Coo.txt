## Role and function of the CNMCCA

The CNMCCA represents the French mutualist and co-operative agricultural movement sectors to:

1. The French authorities and other agricultural professional organizations;
2. European and international authorities: it sits at the Comité des organisations professionnelles agricoles (COPA) ;
3. Of the whole of the movement mutualist and co-operative French within the framework of the Groupement national de la coopération (GNC) and the ICA at the international level.

Its current President is Jean-Marie Sander; its Director General is Roland Combier.

Although mostly now focusing on the provision of services, it was historically a representative of the Radical tradition within the countryside against the larger and more conservative Union nationale des syndicats agricoles. that would later form the main current of the main French farming union, the Fédération nationale des syndicats d'exploitants agricoles.
