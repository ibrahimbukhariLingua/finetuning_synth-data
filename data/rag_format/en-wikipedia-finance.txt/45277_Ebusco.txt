Ebusco


# Ebusco



**Ebusco** is a Dutch manufacturer of electric buses and accompanying charging infrastructure.


## History

Ebusco was founded in 2012 in Helmond. Here the workshop for two vehicles and the office were located in two different neighborhoods about 3 kilometers apart. This was the reason for moving to Deurne in September 2018, where the company has acquired a production hall of more than 7,000 m² and sufficient office space.

Since October 22, 2021, Ebusco has been listed on the Euronext in Amsterdam. Major shareholder is founder Bijvelds, after the IPO in October 2021 he held 35.4% of the shares and ING Group is number two with an equity interest of 21%.

In 2024 the company failed to deliver 59 busses to Qbuzz on the agreed upon delivery date. Spare parts for buses already in service could also not be delivered, causing 10% of Qbuzz buses to be out of service. Qbuzz demanded a previously agreed compensation for the late delivery to be paid out. After Ebusco failed to pay out, Qbuzz seized 1.2 million Euro of Ebusco's bank accounts, causing Ebusco to be unable to pay out salaries. In October 2024 Ebusco announced cutbacks in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy, having 33 million outstanding with creditors.
