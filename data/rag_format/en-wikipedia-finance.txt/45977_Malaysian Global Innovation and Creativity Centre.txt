In 2015, MaGIC started out by running accelerator programs for startup companies in Malaysia, led by a team handpicked by Yeoh. The first intake brought in 77 startups, making MaGIC's accelerator program the largest in Southeast Asia.

Yeoh stepped down on 14 January 2016 after her contract period ended. Her CEO position was replaced by Ashran Ghazi shortly after.
