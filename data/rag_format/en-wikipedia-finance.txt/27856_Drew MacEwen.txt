In 2018, MacEwen and two other Republican state legislators (Doug Ericksen and Brandon Vick) traveled to Cambodia to observe the undemocratic elections in the country, which were not free and fair. The election was held under Hun Sen's authoritarian regime, which has repressed the opposition as well as independent media. The visit raised concerns about whether the three lawmakers were being used to give a veneer of credibility to the sham elections, which were not observed by internationally recognized election monitors. Governor Jay Inslee wrote a letter to the legislators to express concern about the visit. After MacEwen and Vick met with the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, both cut the trip short and returned to Washington.
