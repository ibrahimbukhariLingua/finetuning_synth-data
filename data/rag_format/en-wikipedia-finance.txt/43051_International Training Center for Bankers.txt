International Training Center for Bankers


# International Training Center for Bankers



**International Training Center for Bankers** (**ITCB**) (Hungarian: *Bankárképző*) is a Budapest-based banking academy and consultancy. It provides diploma programs, training, certification and consultancy for the finance industry in central and eastern Europe.


## History

ITCB was founded in 1988 by *Centre de Formation de la Profession Bancaire*, the French banking academy and the post-Socialist commercial banks in Hungary to promote the know-how transfer of economics, finance and commercial banking in the first years of Hungary’s successful economic transition to a market economy. After the restructuring and early privatization, ITCB has remained Hungary’s market-leader banking consulting, training and research company. As Hungary was a regional champion in liberalizing, privatizing and opening her banking and financial markets, ITCB's trainers and consultants have played important roles in the dissemination of this know-how in Central Europe, the Balkans and the former Soviet republics.

In 2006, the International Training Centre for Bankers became part of the Certification & Accreditation System for Financial Services Sector Education and Training which is a transnational project, started in October 2006, being developed in the framework of the Leonardo da Vinci Programme, which is supported by the European Banking Federation and co-ordinated by the *European Banking and Financial Services Training Association*.
