## History

With expanding business range, in January 1909 Jebsen & Jessen Hamburg was founded to coordinate the European business. In December 1963, Jebsen & Jessen Group was founded by Arwed Peter Jessen to concentrate on business in South-East Asia.

## Group logo

The Jebsen Group's logo, established in the founding year of 1895, shows, surrounded by a laurel wreath, three mackerels on top of each other, with the top and bottom ones directing to the left side and the middle one to the right. The logo is related to the heraldic shield of the founders’ hometown in Aabenraa, which belonged to Germany in 1895 but was handed over to Denmark in 1920.
