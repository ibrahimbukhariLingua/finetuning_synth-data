## History

Orion was founded on September 21, 1917 by pharmacists Onni Turpeinen, Eemil Tuurala and Wikki Valkama. Before founding Orion, they worked in a pharmaceutical-chemical factory called Medica. The first premises of the new company were found in a courtyard building in Helsinki's Kruununhaka, Mariankatu 24, i.e. Asunto Oy Mars star. Among the first products of the apothecary were Ballistol gun oil and dulcine. Pediatrician Arvo Ylpp√∂ played a significant role starting in the 1920s.

Orion's diagnostics business was previously concentrated in the Orion Diagnostica profit unit, which was sold to a private equity investor in April 2018. The diagnostics business included the development, manufacture and marketing of diagnostic tests and hygiene tests. Orion Diagnostica changed its name in November 2019 and is now Aidian.
