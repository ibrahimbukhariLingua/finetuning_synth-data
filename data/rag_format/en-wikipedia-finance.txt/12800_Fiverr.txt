## History

Fiverr was founded by Micha Kaufman and Shai Wininger. The founders came up with the concept of a marketplace that would provide a two-sided market for people to buy and sell a variety of digital services typically offered by freelance contractors. Services offered on the site include writing, translation, graphic design, video editing and programming. Fiverr's services start at US$5, and can go up to thousands of dollars.

In December 2013, Fiverr released their iOS app in the Apple App Store, and in March 2014 the company published their Android app in the Google Play Store.

In October 2015, Amazon started legal action against 1,114 Fiverr sellers it claims provide fake reviews on the US version of its website. Fiverr did not dispute Amazon's allegations and stated: "As Amazon noted, we have worked closely together to remove services that violate our terms of use, and respond promptly to any reports of inappropriate content." Amazon filed suit after an undercover sting.

In November 2015, Fiverr announced that it had raised US$60 million in a Series D round of funding, led by Square Peg Capital. The round brought their total funding to date to $110 million.

On 18 February 2021, the company reported $189.5 million in revenue for the 2020 fiscal year, a 77% increase from the previous fiscal year ($107.1 million).
