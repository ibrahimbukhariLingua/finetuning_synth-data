## History of the Hacienda of San Antonio Clavería

The Hacienda of San Antonio Clavería was formed in the last third of the 17th century. Its first proprietor to be known was Domingo Bustamante, a Spaniard. This hacienda was in the limits of the borough of Azcapotzalco (in those days the pueblo Azcapotzalco) and even the Tacuba area. When Bustamante died, the Hacienda was bought by a man surnamed Otero for a large sum of money.

The hacienda barely managed to stand the fierce wars in Mexico in the 19th century. By the 20th, it was converted into a wheat barn, which didn't help the building's architecture.

It was restored in 1951. The institute arrived in 1967.
