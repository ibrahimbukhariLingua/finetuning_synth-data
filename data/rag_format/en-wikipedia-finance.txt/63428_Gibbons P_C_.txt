## History

The firm was founded in 1926 by Andrew Crummy, a World War I veteran who attended New York University and Harvard Law School. After working as an IRS agent, he formed a law partnership with fellow attorney Adam Rossbach that was originally called Crummy & Rossbach. Following Rossbach's passing in the mid-1930s, Crummy later partnered with William Consodine in 1945 to form Crummy & Consodine. When John Joseph Gibbons, for whom the firm is currently named, in 1950, its name changed to Crummy, Consodine & Gibbons. Gibbons left in 1970 when he was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Upon his return in 1990, the firm became known as Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger & Vecchione, ultimately shortening its name to Gibbons P.C. in 2007.

The firm opened its New York office in 1997; Trenton in 2002; Philadelphia in 2005; Wilmington in 2007; Washington, DC, and West Palm Beach in 2018; and Red Bank in 2019. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In February 2022, Gibbons reorganized its firm management structure, dividing the role of Chairman and Managing Director. Patrick C. Dunican Jr. was named Executive Chairperson after serving as the firm's Chairman and Managing Director for nearly two decades. Peter J. Torcicollo, who had been a member and ultimately co-chair of Gibbons' Commercial & Criminal Litigation Group since 1993, assumed the Managing Director role.


## Recognition

The *New Jersey Law Journal* has awarded Gibbons a "Litigation Practice of the Year" designation five times in recent years, in the employment, class actions, products liability, and commercial litigation categories and with the overall "General Litigation Practice of the Year" honor. In addition, the Gibbons Government & Regulatory Affairs Group, based in its Trenton office, was the top lawyer-lobbying firm by revenue in the state of New Jersey in 2023, the fifteenth consecutive year the firm achieved that rank.
