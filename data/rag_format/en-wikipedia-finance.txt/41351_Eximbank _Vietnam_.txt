## Scandal

On February 22, 2018, Eximbank announced that Mr. Le Nguyen Hung, former director of Eximbank's Ho Chi Minh City branch, was accused of forging documents and power of attorney to embezzle more than 245 billion VND from customer Chu Thi Binh and then fled abroad. According to Mrs. Binh's lawyer, the signature of the authorized person was forged and Mrs. Binh had never been to the bank to make the power of attorney.

On the morning of March 26, 2018, two customer service officers, Ho Ngoc Thuy and Nguyen Thi Thi, were arrested for allegedly being accomplices, helping Mr. Le Nguyen Hung embezzle 245 billion VND in savings. In addition, 3 other employees were also prosecuted and banned from leaving their place of residence.
