MetaERP


# MetaERP



**MetaERP** is an proprietary Enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution developed by Huawei which was launched on April 24, 2023.


## History

The company began with a manufacturing resource planning (MRP) solution in 1996. Then, the company upgraded its legacy ERP system from third-party American suppliers, followed by further improvements for internal management. Since the United States Entity List of May 2019 barred American software technology companies from supplying ERP systems to Huawei prompted the company to develop an in-house ERP system for the next following three years.


## Overview

MetaERP targets mid-sized and large enterprises. For ease of migration to the ERP system, it consists of the following modules such as Financials and Operations, Sales Enterprise, Marketing, Customer Service, Field Service, and Project Service Automation using its Linux-based EulerOS server operating system and GaussDB relational database management system.


## Usage

After launch on April 24, 2023, the first batch of large-scale switching was carried out in May 14 midnight, across Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia, Southern Africa, and Latin America. The business covers ICT and Huawei Cloud, alongside terminals and other industries. Over thousands of employees in 75 countries use MetaERP in stable operation post-launch.

MetaERP currently handles 100% of Huawei's internal business and most of the 80% of its business operations.
