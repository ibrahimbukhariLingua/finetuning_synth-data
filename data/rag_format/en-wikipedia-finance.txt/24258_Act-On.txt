# Act-On



**Act-On Software** is a software-as-a-service product for marketing automation. The company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and was founded in 2008, originally retailing its software exclusively through Cisco, which provided $2 million in funding.


## History

Act-On was founded in 2008 by Raghu Raghavan, formerly a founder of Responsys, after he saw "potential for a sophisticated, but affordable SaaS marketing tool mid-market companies could easily use." Act-On initially sold through alternate channels, but later created its own sales team. Entering the market after several competitors had been established, Act-On had a second-mover advantage, learning from the successes and failures of earlier market entrants.

In 2011, Act-On raised a third round for $10 million in June 2011 and established a new location in Silicon Valley. The company raised an additional $16 million in funding the following year.

By 2013, the number of employees had grown to 140, up from 11 in 2010 and 35 in 2011.

In April 2014, $42 million in additional funding was raised, which was the largest funding round in the Oregon technology market since the dot com bubble. Act-On now employs about 200 people across the US and UK, serving more than 4,000 customers worldwide. In 2015, Act-On expanded its executive team with a new CFO, formerly of the company Jive, a VP of demand generation, previously with ExactTarget, and a VP of cloud operations.

In 2015, Act-On announced the appointment of Andy MacMillan to the position of CEO. The former CEO and company founder Raghu Raghavan assumed the role of CTO. Prior to joining Act-On Software, Andy held several senior leadership positions at Salesforce, including Chief Operating Officer of the Products Division and Senior Vice President & General Manager of Data.com, where he helped to significantly grow customer adoption of products and services.

In early 2016, it expanded again into larger offices in Portland.

In 2018, Act-On announced its board of directors had appointed Kate Johnson as the company's new CEO to replace Andy MacMillan. The company consolidated its operations to Portland, Oregon at this time. Ms. Johnson had served as Act-On's CFO for the prior 3 years and was endorsed by Diane Fraiman, Voyager Capital Partner and Act-On board member and investor in the formal press release.

In 2019 Act-On raised a second round of funding for $4 million.

In June 2020, Act-On Software rebranded itself to fit the modern marketing tool needs, prioritizing engagement, updates on services, and product inventory.

In 2023, Act-On has reported to hit $25.8M revenue and 4k customers. The current number of employees is around 200 in 2024

As part of its Open Marketing Ecosystem, the Act-On platform offers native integrations with all major CRM systems, to be vendor-agnostic without being indifferent.

Act-On also promotes its agency partners and third-party applications on the Act-On Partner Exchange (APEX), manages an educational resource called the Act-On Center of Excellence (ACE) and provides professional services.
