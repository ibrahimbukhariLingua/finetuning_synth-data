## History

Abir Sen, CEO, launched Gravie on November 15, 2013 with co-founders Jill Prevost and Marek Ciolko and $2.6 million in initial investor funding from FirstMark Capital. On March 17, 2014, the company announced $10.5 million in additional investor funding led by Aberdare Ventures. FirstMark Capital also participated in the second round of funding.

After a further round of funding in 2015, in 2016 the firm laid off 21 employees.

In 2016 Securian Financial Group invested in Gravie and began selling its life insurance products through Gravie's website.

In 2024, despite Gravie's numerous investments, apparent successes, and a huge spike in hiring, Abir Sen stepped down as CEO and the company laid off 70+ employees, many of whom had been there since Gravie's early years.
