# Capital Research Center



**Capital Research Center** (**CRC**) is an American conservative 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Washington, D.C. Its stated purpose is "to study non-profit organizations, with a special focus on reviving the American traditions of charity, philanthropy, and voluntarism." According to *The Washington Post*, it also discourages donations by corporations and non-profits supporting what it sees as liberal or anti-business policies. It monitors the giving of major liberal donors in the U.S.


## History

CRC was founded in 1984 by Willa Johnson, former senior vice president of The Heritage Foundation, deputy director of the Office of Presidential Personnel in the first term of the Reagan administration, and a legislative aide in both the United States Senate and House of Representatives. Journalist and author Marvin Olasky previously served as a senior fellow at CRC.

In 2011, *Politico* reported that CRC had received millions of dollars from conservative philanthropists over the years, with a total budget in 2009 of $1.4 million. Donors have included foundations run by the Koch family, the Scaifes, and the Bradleys.

David Clarke, the former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is the chair of CRC's American Law and Culture program.


## Publications and policy stances

CRC has been highly critical of animal rights activists and the environmental movement. In 2006, it published *The Green Wave: Environmentalism and Its Consequences*, a book by Bonner Cohen. In 2007, it published the third edition of *The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of "Donor Intent"* by Martin Morse Wooster, a senior fellow at the Center. In 2008, it published *Guide to Nonprofit Advocacy,* by James Dellinger. The CRC said Al Gore's campaign to control carbon emissions is motivated by the likelihood that he will make an "immense fortune" if laws are passed to control them, and has published authors who deny human influence in climate change.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ They have argued that organized labor is bad for America, and criticized government efforts to weaken intellectual property protection of prescription medications.


### InfluenceWatch

In 2017, the CRC launched the website **InfluenceWatch**, which is an online encyclopedia of donors, nonprofits, and political influencers. InfluenceWatch documented "the extent to which dark money from Democratically aligned groups was used during the 2020 election."


## Film production

CRC has a film production arm called Dangerous Documentaries, which partially funded *No Safe Spaces* by Adam Carolla and radio host Dennis Prager, about political correctness on college campuses.
