Electricity price area


# Electricity price area



An **electricity price area** is a zone throughout which the electricity is traded at the *same* spot price on a power exchange. An electricity price area is decided by transmission system operator and can be a whole country, or parts of it.


## EPADs and price area risk

The electricity price usually differs from the system price from one price area to another, e.g. when there are constraints in the transmission grid. A special contract for difference called **Electricity Price Area Differentials** or **EPAD** allows members on the power exchange to hedge against this market risk called **area price risk**.
