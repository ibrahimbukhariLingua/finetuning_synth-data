## History

The company was founded in 2014 by Hong Kong–based businessmen Florian Martigny and Alexis Zirah to create a global marketplace specifically for luxury products. When the founders were looking to buy luxury products in Hong Kong, they were disappointed when they couldn't locate a reliable online resource, where people could trade items. Realising that most luxury purchases, especially in Asia, were influenced by online touchpoints, they decided to create an online marketplace for new and used luxury products with the aim of creating more liquidity and transparency in the luxury market. They officially launched their website Luxify.com in 2014. Luxify received its angel funding round from private investors located in Asia and Europe to continue its global expansion. Luxify was named one of Asia's most promising internet companies in 2015. The company also partners with luxury goods companies to widen their market and reach. In June 2015, Luxify partnered with Landscope Christie's International Real Estate to offer consultative service for clients who wish to purchase the finest overseas vineyard properties. Also, seeing Philippines as being one of the greatest economic growth countries in Asia, Luxify teamed up with Salcedo Auctions, which is the only auction house in the Philippines to specialise in the sale of fine art, jewelry, decorative arts and collective accessories, to promote its upcoming Collector's Sale auction. In October the same year, Luxify partnered with Zachy Wine Auction for its final auction of the Fall 2015 Hong Kong season to showcase collections of some of the finest wines and spirits.
