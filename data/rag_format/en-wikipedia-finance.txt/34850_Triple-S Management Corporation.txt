With over one million customers, in addition to its core managed care business, TSM operates two complementary businesses in life, and property and casualty insurance. Founded in 1959, it has become the largest medical insurance provider in Puerto Rico thanks to its licensed affiliation with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Since 1965, Triple-S, Inc. has been an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, holding the exclusive rights to the Blue Cross Blue Shield name and trademark in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. This provides its members with access to the Blue Card network in the U.S. It is the only managed-care company that serves all market sectors, including Medicare, Medicaid, Group and Individual, in Puerto Rico.
