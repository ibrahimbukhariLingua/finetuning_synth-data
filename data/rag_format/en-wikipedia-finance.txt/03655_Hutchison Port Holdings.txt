In 2005, HPH was the largest port operator in the world, with a 33.2 million TEU throughput, and 8.3% world market share.

In September 2016, HPH rebranded its network as Hutchison Ports.

In December 2016, the Chornomorsk commercial seaport in western Ukraine, signed a cooperation agreement with Hutchison Ports. Among the agreed upon points are the company's entry into the port as a terminal operator as of 2017. Hutchison will provide expert consultative services to reform and improve Ukraine's port industry.

In January 2025, the government of Panama commenced an audit of a local HPH subsidiary and a review of a 2021 concession contract for port operations on the Panama Canal that had been criticized for lacking transparency and generating limited benefits for Panama's economy. In February 2025, a lawsuit was filed in Panama's Supreme Court of Justice seeking to cancel HPH's port operations contract at the Panama Canal.
