## History

Metal Supermarkets was established in 1985 as a single location in Mississauga by William H. Mair, who saw an untapped market in offering small quantities of metal, which many large metal suppliers could not satisfy. Therefore, Metal Supermarkets adopted a business model based on cut-to-size metals and no minimum order size.

Metal Supermarkets began franchising in 1987, eventually expanding into the United Kingdom in 1994 and the United States in 1996. In 2007, Metal Supermarkets acquired and integrated Metal Express, a similar American metal supplier. Metal Supermarkets opened its 100th location in 2020.


## Products and services

Metal Supermarkets supplies various metals, including various alloys, rolled metals, aluminium, brass, copper, steel, and tool steel, among others, in various shapes and grades such as bars, beams, sheets, and pipes, which can be cut to a size desired by the customer. Franchises can supply more uncommon metals for customers on request. Metal Supermarkets also offers metal cutting, shearing, notching, and fabrication services.

## Community involvement
