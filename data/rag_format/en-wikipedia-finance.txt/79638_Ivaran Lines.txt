## History


### Stockard Steamship Corporation

Stockard Steamship Company of New York was the major agent of Ivaran for many years. Ivaran had an involvement with Stockard resulted from World War II as they operated a tramping service between the East Coast of USA and South America which was previously managed by fellow Norwegian company A/S Holter Sørensens.
In *Merchant Ships* (The Macmillan Company; 1944), E.C. Talbot-Booth shows the vessels *Ivaran* and *Lise* in the name of Ivaran Lines which fits with the name based New York given by F. J. N. Wedge in *Brown’s Flags and Funnels* (Brown, Son and Ferguson; 1951). Subsequently Ivarans appear to have re-established in Oslo under their own name.

* Stockard Steamship Corporation was active with charter shipping with the Maritime Commission and War Shipping Administration for World War II. The ship was run by its Stockard Steamship Corporation crew and the US Navy supplied United States Navy Armed Guards to man the deck guns and radio.

### CP Ships

Ivaran Lines was bought by CP Ships in May 1998, being unprofitable at that time. The last Ivaran's chairman was Eirik Holter-Sorensen. CP's Ivaran brand name was replaced by the *Lykes Lines* brand in 2000. By 2001 CP Ships was the seventh largest carrier in the world.

When acquired by CP Ships, Ivaran Lines was operating the following services:

* U.S. East Coast to East Coast South America (with Columbus Line and Alianca)
* U.S. Gulf Coast to East Coast South America (with Grupo Libra and TMM)
* U.S. Gulf Coast to Central America and the Caribbean.

CP Ships was bought out in late 2005 by TUI AG and merged in mid-2006 in the Hapag-Lloyd organization.
