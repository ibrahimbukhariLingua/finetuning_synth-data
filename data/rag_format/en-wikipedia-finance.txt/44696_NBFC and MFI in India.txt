## MFI

Micro finance Institutions, also known as MFIs, a microfinance institution is an organisation that offers financial services to low income people. Almost all give loans to their members, and many offer insurance, deposit and other services. A great scale of organisations are regarded as **microfinance institutes**. They are those that offer credits and other financial services to the representatives of poor strata of population (except for extremely poor strata).


## MFIs go for NBFC licences

An Increasing number of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are seeking non-banking finance company (NBFC) status from RBI to get wide access to funding, including bank finance.

## MFIs & SHG-Bank linkage programme

In a joint fact-finding study on microfinance conducted by the Reserve Bank of India and a few major banks, the following observations were made:

* Some of the microfinance institutions (MFIs) financed by banks or acting as their intermediaries or partners appear to be focusing on relatively better banked areas, including areas covered by the SHG-Bank linkage programme. Competing MFIs were operating in the same area, and trying to reach out to the same set of poor, resulting in multiple lending and overburdening of rural households.
* Many MFIs supported by banks were not engaging themselves in capacity building and empowerment of the groups to the desired extent. The MFIs were disbursing loans to the newly formed groups within 10–15 days of their formation, in contrast to the practice

obtaining in the SHG – Bank linkage programme, which takes about six to seven months for group formation and nurturing. As a result, cohesiveness and a sense of purpose were not being built up in the groups formed by these MFIs.

* Banks, as principal financiers of MFIs, do not appear to be engaging them with regard to their systems, practices and lending policies with a view to ensuring better transparency and adherence to best practices. many cases, no review of MFI operations were undertaken after sanctioning the credit facility.

## MFIs

Forbes magazine named seven microfinance institutes in India in the list of the world's top 50 microfinance institutions.

Bandhan, as well as two other Indian MFIs—Microcredit Foundation of India (ranked 13th) and Saadhana Microfin Society (15th) – have been placed above Bangladesh-based Grameen Bank (which along with its founder Mohammed Yunus, was awarded the Nobel Prize).
Besides Bandhan, the Microcredit Foundation of India and Saadhana Microfin Society, other Indian entries include Grameen Koota (19th), Sharada's Women's Association for Weaker Section (23rd), SKS Microfinance Private Ltd (44th) and Asmitha Microfin Ltd (29th).

According to a report by CareEdge Ratings, the MFI sector will continue to grow at double-digit rates in 2024.


## Criticisms

Microfinance has come under fire in the state of Andhra Pradesh due to allegations of MFIs using coercive recollection practices and charging usurious interest rates. These charges resulted in the state government's passing of the Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Ordinance on 15 October 2010. The Ordinance requires MFIs to register with the state government and gives the state government the power, suo moto, to shut down MFI activity. A number of NBFCs have been affected by the ordinance, including sector heavyweight SKS Microfinance.
