## Rounds


### Round One: Rapper Selection Round

For the Korea audition, this season marked the return of the stadium auditions, where contestants will register at the venue and take part in Round One on the same day. As a safety precaution from the COVID-19 pandemic, the contestants will be divided into small groups, with each contestant socially distanced from one another, and have a plexiglass placed between him/her and the assigned producer. Each contestant will perform a short a cappella rap in front of the producer. The producer then provide an in-depth evaluation of the contestant, and determine if they advanced to the next round. Similar to the previous two seasons, the contestant will grab the chain at the corner of the plexiglass if he/she passes the round.

A total of 108 contestants, including 5 from the Los Angeles audition, moved on to Round Two.

### Round Three: Guerilla Beat Cypher

This round features no beats played by the DJ, instead there would be two drummers/percussionists playing the drums and percussions live for original beats without melody, a first in the Show Me The Money series. On the stage there are two microphones, one lighted in blue and one lighted in red. The grabbing of those microphones are of a first-come, first-serve basis. One contestant would be on stage to grab whichever microphone that lights up first, and start his/her rap performance. After that, another contestant grabs the second microphone that lights up and start his/her rap performance. The beat ends when the contestant with the second microphone ends his/her rap performance. A total of 22 matchups are formed. The producer judges and some invited contestants who were eliminated earlier in the first and second rounds vote for the winner of each matchup. After this round, three contestants from each team would be eliminated.

### Round Eight: Semi-final Performances

For this round, the matchups are decided based on the contestants of Team Grillz (the team with the most cumulated money in the previous round) each picking their opponents, followed by Don Malik (who was on Team R. Jus which has the second most cumulated money in the previous round) picking his opponent, and the remaining two not picked would automatically be matched up. For each matchup, through two rounds of voting, the winner would be decided. The contestant with more money would advance to the final, while the other contestant would be eliminated.

### Round Nine: Final Performances (Live Episode)

The final round will be televised live, and the winner of the season is decided based from the votes from both the live audience and live SMS voting. The four finalists will meet up prior at a undisclosed location to determine their order of performances. The final round will be divided into two parts: the first part of the finals featured all four finalists each having a performance with special guest performer(s) as featuring. After all four finalists performed, a two-round voting process from both the live audience and live SMS voting will be held, and the performance ranking based on the live audience will be announced. In the second part of the finals, the four finalists will each perform with their producer(s) and/or special guest performer(s) featuring, with the same two-round voting process and announcement of performance ranking held after the final performances. The contestant who earned the most cumulative performance money from both the pre-finals online evaluation team voters and live SMS voters in all two performances will be the season's champion, will receive ₩100,000,000 in prize money, plus first class air ticket and accommodation stay in Beverly Hills, worth ₩100,000,000 in total. The final episode will also include a special performance from eliminated contestants, with the song to be included in this season's official discography.
