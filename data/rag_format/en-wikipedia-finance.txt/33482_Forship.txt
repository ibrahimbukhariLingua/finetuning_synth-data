**Forship Engenharia** is a Brazilian business group, with significant presence in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. With strategic focus on commissioning and operability, the group offers engineering and technical consultancy services and products to the oil & natural gas, shipbuilding, petrochemical, energy and mining industries, among others.


## History

The company was founded in 1998 by Fabio Fares, who identified the lack of structured methods and tools for the commissioning activity management of complex industrial projects in the country. Its activities have naturally expanded to the energy, petrochemicals, and mining sectors.

In 2006, Forship established an office in Singapore in order to manage Forship Asia operations, supporting the provision of services for the Middle East and Asia market areas.

In 2007, the Group was granted ISO 9001 certification in Commissioning Management, by DNV.

In April 2009, the Forship engineering manager, Bruno Montenegro, published an article in the EPC News magazine supporting acknowledgment of Commissioning as an independent discipline of engineering.

In 2008, Forship became an active member of the CE-EPC – Centro de Excelência em EPC, (Brazilian Center of Excellence in EPC), a non-profit entity that gathers operators, EPC companies, service providers, regulatory entities, and universities in order to improve and share the best practices on EPC projects, so that the Brazilian industry in the oil, gas, and energy sectors can become competitive and sustainable.

In 2012, Forship Group established an office in Mozambique, in order to provide commissioning services and develop integrated information technology solutions, initially focusing on the mining and infrastructure sectors.

In 2013, Forship Integrated Management System was granted certifications (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001) by DNV.
