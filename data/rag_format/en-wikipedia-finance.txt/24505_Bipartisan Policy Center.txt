Bipartisan Policy Center


# Bipartisan Policy Center



The **Bipartisan Policy Center** (**BPC**) is a Washington, D.C.–based think tank that promotes bipartisanship. The organization aims to combine ideas from both the Republican and Democratic parties to address challenges in the United States such as those around energy and the national debt.


## History

BPC was founded as a non-profit organization in 2007 by former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, Bob Dole, and George J. Mitchell. While BPC was formally launched in March 2007, the organization's roots trace back to 2002, when the National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP), predecessor to BPC's current Energy Project, was founded.

On November 17, 2010, BPC's "Debt Reduction Task Force" released its report, *Restoring America's Future*, in an effort to influence the debate over the national debt.

In June 2023, Margaret Spellings was announced as CEO.


## Funding

The organization was critiqued in 2013 as advancing the interests of its funders, including many corporations and industry associations who provide some operational support, while philanthropies fund much of the programmatic work.


## Political action committee

BPC partners with a political action committee called BPC Action. BPC Action is "committed to seeing bipartisan policy solutions enacted into law", and "[works] closely with [its] 501(c)(3) partner, the Bipartisan Policy Center, to advance smart policies through the legislative process". BPC Action is a separate, 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
