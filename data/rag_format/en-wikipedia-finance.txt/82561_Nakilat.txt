The vast majority of these LNG carriers are dedicated to meeting the transportation requirements of Qatar's massive LNG industry.

Most of Nakilat's vessels are employed through long-term time charter agreements with local gas producer Qatargas, while the remainder of the fleet is utilized in international shipping markets. Its jointly owned LNG carriers are operated by the vessel's co-owners.

## Recent achievements


### LNG ship management

In June 2012, full responsibility for the management and operations of Nakilat's four LPG carriers was transferred from Shell to Nakilat Shipping Qatar Limited (NSQL). In 2014 NSQL assumed ship management responsibility for the four Nakilat / OSG Q-Flex LNG vessels in a challenging timeframe, commencing in February and completing in July of the same year, bringing the number of gas vessels fully managed by NSQL to eight. As part of the company's long-term strategic vision for growth, Nakilat then undertook one of the largest vessel management transitions with Shell, involving the transfer of management of 10 LNG carriers from Shell to NSQL. The transition was completed within a year in August 2017. In March 2019, Nakilat signed an agreement with Maran Ventures to establish a new joint venture and expand its fleet with an additional four LNG carriers that will be managed by NSQL once delivered. With the four newbuild LNG carriers added to its fleet, NSQL currently manages 18 LNG carriers and four LPG carriers.


### Expansion into FSRU market

In June 2018, Nakilat signed a landmark agreement with Excelerate Energy USA to establish a joint-venture company and acquire a 55% interest in a Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU), the first such vessel to join the Nakilat fleet. This was the first FSRU co-owned by a Qatari company, paving the way for Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) to expand its outreach to developing and emerging markets.

A FSRU act as a hub for LNG deliveries. Located in Port Qasim in Pakistan, the FSRU unit 'Exquisite' has a capacity of 150,900 cubic meters and a peak regasification rate of 745 million cubic feet per day.


### JV established for Offshore and Onshore fabrication

Nakilat signed an agreement with McDermott to form a joint-venture (JV) company, Qatar Fabrication Company (QFAB), providing offshore and onshore fabrication services in Qatar in February 2019. This is aimed at increasing productivity levels at Nakilat's Erhama Bin Jaber Al Jalahma Shipyard and developing local construction capabilities to support the increasing demand for construction of offshore and onshore structures in Qatar. This new JV comes at a strategic time, with Qatar's ambition to localize its energy sector's supply chain and increase its liquefied natural gas production from 77 to 110 million tonnes per annum in the coming years.

The JV company will be operated from Nakilat's shipyard in Ras Laffan Industrial City, comprising extensive fabrication areas and facilities such as a 270-metre construction hall and a 180-metre assembly workshop featuring four bays.
