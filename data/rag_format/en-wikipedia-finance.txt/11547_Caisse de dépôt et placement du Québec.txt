Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec


# Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec



The **Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec** (French pronunciation: [kɛs də depo e plasmɑ̃ dy kebɛk], **CDPQ**; English: Quebec Deposit and Investment Fund) is an institutional investor that manages several public and parapublic pension plans and insurance programs in the Canadian province of Quebec. It was established in 1965 by an act of the National Assembly, under the government of Jean Lesage, as part of the Quiet Revolution, a period of social and political change in Quebec. It is the second-largest pension fund in Canada, after the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. It was created to manage the funds of the newly created Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan that aimed to provide financial security for Quebecers in retirement. The CDPQ’s mandate was to invest the funds prudently and profitably while also contributing to Quebec’s economic development. As of December 31, 2023, the CDPQ managed assets of C$434 billion, invested in Canada and elsewhere. The CDPQ is headquartered in Quebec City at the Price building and has its main business office in Montreal at the Édifice Jacques-Parizeau.

The CDPQ is a unique institution that plays a vital role in the economic and social development of Quebec and Canada. It is one of the largest and most diversified institutional investors in the world, investing in sectors including private equity, fixed income, real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy, in Canada and abroad. It also supports Quebec-based companies with growth potential and contributes to the creation of jobs and wealth in the province.

Over the years, the CDPQ has expanded its scope and scale, managing the funds of other public and parapublic pension and insurance plans, such as the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP), and the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec. It has also diversified its portfolio, investing in different asset classes and markets around the world. It has established offices in several countries, such as the United States, Mexico, Brazil, France, India, China, Singapore, and Australia. It has also acquired or partnered with several subsidiaries, such as Ivanhoé Cambridge (real estate), CDPQ Infra (infrastructure), and Otéra Capital (financing).


## History


### Creation and early years (1965–1979)

The CDPQ was established by an act of the National Assembly on July 15, 1965, under the government of Jean Lesage, as part of the Quiet Revolution, a period of social and political change in Quebec. Its initial role was to manage the funds of the newly created Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan that aimed to provide financial security for Quebecers in retirement. The CDPQ’s mandate was to invest the funds prudently and profitably while also contributing to Quebec’s economic development.

In its early years, the CDPQ focused on building a bond portfolio that included predominantly Quebec government and Hydro-Québec securities. It made its first equity investment in Alcan Aluminium in 1967 and its first commercial mortgage loans in the same year. In 1971, it created the private investments portfolio, which included investments in Quebec companies.


### Diversification and expansion (1980–1999)

In the 1980s, the CDPQ entered into international markets and the real estate sector. It made its first transactions in global equities exchanges in 1983 and its first international private equity investment in Compagnie financière Martin Maurel, in France, in 1984. It also acquired its first office building, Place Delta in Sainte-Foy, in 1980, and its first international real estate acquisition, Centre de conférence Albert-Borschette in Brussels, in 1993.

In the 1990s, the CDPQ diversified its real estate portfolio and increased its equity allocation. It acquired the real estate assets of the Steinberg grocery chain in 1989 and merged its real estate subsidiary, Ivanhoé, with Cambridge Shopping Centres in 2001, creating Ivanhoé Cambridge. It also obtained a legislative change in 1997 that increased its allowable equity allocation from 40% to 70% of its assets. It also moved into infrastructure investment in 1999, with the construction of Highway 407 in Toronto.


### Crisis and recovery (2000–2009)

In the 2000s, the CDPQ faced the worst financial crisis since the stock market crash of 1929, which resulted in a loss of $42.5 billion in 2008. Following the crisis, the CDPQ adopted a series of measures to increase its effectiveness, refocus on its core competencies, and strengthen its risk management in order to better sustain long-term yields. It also launched a major plan to support Quebec businesses in 2009. It adopted a responsible investing policy in 2004 and signed the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment in 2006. In 2009, Otéra Capital, a subsidiary of the CDPQ, was created to act as a leader in commercial real estate debt across North America. Otéra Capital offers innovative financing solutions for various real estate sectors, such as office, retail, industrial, multifamily, hospitality, and seniors' housing.


### Growth and innovation (2010–present)

In the 2010s, the CDPQ accelerated its pace of growth and expansion in Canada and abroad. In 2013 it created the Global Quality Equity Portfolio, which followed a new investment philosophy that favoured total returns, in-depth research, and investments in high-quality assets, anchored in the real economy. It combined all its real estate subsidiaries under one banner, Ivanhoé Cambridge, in 2011. It also established offices in several countries, such as the United States, Mexico, Brazil, France, India, China, Singapore, and Australia. In 2015, CDPQ Infra, a subsidiary of the CDPQ, was created to act as a principal contractor for public infrastructure projects. CDPQ Infra is responsible for all phases of a project: planning, financing, execution and operation. It aims to foster the effective delivery of modern, efficient, and sustainable infrastructure projects that meet the needs of communities. CDPQ Infra also leverages the CDPQ’s infrastructure expertise and adopts international best practices to execute work on time and on budget.

In a September 28, 2021, press release, the CDPQ announced its 2021 climate strategy, which included divesting the remaining $3.9 billion currently held in oil company assets, which represented 1% of its investment portfolio, by 2022. According to the statement, the CDPQ was responding "to the markets, to science, and to the will of Quebecers who do not want their money to fuel the climate crisis."

As of June 30, 2023, the CDPQ managed assets of C$424 billion, invested in sectors such as private equity, fixed income, real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy in Canada and elsewhere. It also supported Quebec-based companies with growth potential and contributed to the creation of jobs and wealth in the province. It strived to generate positive impacts for society and the environment. In 2022, Global SWF, a publication that covers sovereign wealth funds and other long-term public investors, awarded the CDPQ its 2022 Fund of the Year award. The next year, *Infrastructure Investor* magazine, which focuses on the global infrastructure investment market, ranked the CDPQ the top institutional investor in infrastructure based on asset size in the Global Investor 50 list.


## Mandate and independence

In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

> 4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act."


## Growth and strategy

CDPQ has five investment priorities: optimal performance, Québec economy, worldwide presence, sustainable investing, and technology.

CDPQ has expanded its global presence by opening offices in key markets such as New York, London, Singapore, Mexico City, São Paulo, Paris, New Delhi, and Sydney.


## Involvement in major infrastructure projects


### Réseau express métropolitain (REM), greater Montreal

The Réseau express métropolitain (REM) is a public infrastructure project in greater Montréal that was proposed by the CDPQ at the request of the government of Quebec. In 2015, the CDPQ proposed a new model for infrastructure projects to the Quebec government, based on its expertise and financial capacity. It then created a subsidiary, CDPQ Infra, to manage major public infrastructure projects in Quebec and abroad. The REM is the first project of CDPQ Infra, which owns and operates the fully electric and automated light rail system that will serve Greater Montréal. CDPQ Infra is responsible for all aspects of the REM, from design and construction to financing and maintenance, as well as the procurement of rolling stock and systems. CDPQ Infra also follows environmental and social standards and communicates and consults with the public and stakeholders. The REM project has several expected outcomes, including improving the mobility of commuters, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating thousands of jobs, supporting the development of electric transportation, and stimulating economic and real estate growth. Construction on the REM began in April 2018 and is planned to be completed by 2027. The first trains operated in 2023 between Brossard and Gare Centrale Stations. The REM will be one of the longest automated metro lines in the world, with a 67-km route and 26 stations. It will connect downtown, the South Shore, the North Shore, the West Island, and Montréal-Trudeau International Airport.


### Canada Line, Metro Vancouver

The CDPQ was part of a consortium that developed and operated the Canada Line, a public transit infrastructure project in Metro Vancouver. The consortium, named InTransit BC, also included AtkinsRéalis (formerly SNC-Lavalin) and other infrastructure and transportation companies. The Canada Line project started in 2004, with the goal of providing transit options connecting downtown Vancouver to Vancouver International Airport and Richmond. InTransit BC won the public-private partnership contract for the Canada Line project. The consortium provided financial backing and expertise in infrastructure development and transportation. The project involved the construction of a new SkyTrain line, which included tunnelling under the Fraser River and various stations along the route. The Canada Line opened to the public in 2009, on time and within budget. It has become an important part of the Greater Vancouver transit system, facilitating the movement of people and goods while contributing to the region’s sustainable growth and development.

On 22 April 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transit project, the Réseau express métropolitain (REM). The REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes), and the airport through a unified, electrically powered and fully automated 67-km light metro system. The network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is committing $3 billion as the majority shareholder.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Controversy over private security investments

The CQDP has been criticized for investing in the private security industry. It became the main shareholder of Allied Universal and also invested in CAE Inc. Critics have derided the poor economic value of these choices. and the social and ethical problems that surround the industry. The holding of Allied Universal by the CQDP became more of a problem after the company acquired G4S, a firm that has been implicated in many controversies that led most public pension funds to divest from it. G4S holds parts of Policity Corporation, a company that operate Israel's National Police Academy. The global ESG rating of G4S in 2019 was C−.
