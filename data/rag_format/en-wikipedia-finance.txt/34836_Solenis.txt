## Awards


### Soyad Adhesives Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award

Soy-based adhesives are often used in the manufacturing of wood products such as plywood and medium density fiberboard, especially when environmental concerns for petrochemical-based resins are considered. As a result, Solenis developed a completely formulated soy adhesive for use in wood composites, which offers furniture manufacturers and consumers a safer alternative.
Solenis' line of Soyad adhesives contains no formaldehyde and low volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Typical interior wood products include urea formaldehyde (UF) in their adhesives. Over time, UF releases free formaldehyde into the air in a carcinogenic gaseous form, which can be inhaled by humans. Following legislation enacted to reduce formaldehyde emissions, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the United States' strictest emissions standards. Soyad adhesives meet both CARB Phase 2 standards and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) criteria. As a result of this product development, Solenis (operating as Ashland Water Technologies at the time) was jointly awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award along with Columbia Forest Products and Kaichang Li, Ph.D., of Oregon State University.


### Biobond. 2013 Breakthrough Technology of the Year

The Biobond. Improving the Sustainability of Paper Program is a program that improves sustainability and productivity for manufacturers of recycled paperboard.

The announcement was made during RISI's Global Outlook Conference held in December 2013 in Dubai.
