# Roku, Inc.



**Roku, Inc.** (/ˈroʊkuː/ ROH-koo) is an American technology company. Founded in 2002 by Anthony Wood, it produces Roku-branded streaming players and TVs, distributes streaming services and operates an ad business on its platform. Roku is the U.S. market leader in streaming video distribution, reaching 145 million people as of 2024. Outside the U.S., the company operates in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K., and Latin American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

In its initial years, Roku focused on making high-definition video players and launched the first connected TV device to stream Netflix in 2008. Later, in 2014, the company expanded the reach of its streaming platform by partnering with TV manufacturers to license Roku's technology. This allowed Roku's operating system to get pre-installed on smart TVs. Roku has since added channel subscriptions to its platform, while also serving targeted and performance-based ads. In addition, it operates its own ad-supported streaming service and produces consumer electronic products such as smart speakers and smart home devices.


## History


### 2002–2007: Early years

Roku was founded in October 2002 as a limited liability company (LLC), by ReplayTV founder Anthony Wood. *Roku* (六), meaning "six" in the Japanese language, represented the fact that Roku was the sixth company Wood started.

Netflix's association with Roku also involved Wood taking a part-time job at Netflix to make a device to stream Netflix while serving as Roku's CEO.

In the same year, Roku's headquarters moved to Saratoga, California, further south in Silicon Valley. A round of venture capital funding from Menlo Ventures was announced in October 2008. Another round of about $8.4 million was disclosed in 2009. This year also saw Netflix sell all of its Roku shares, translating to nearly 15% of Roku's equity, to Menlo Ventures to avoid the perception of potentially favoring one streaming distribution manufacturer over another.

In 2017 Roku also launched its self-serving advertising product to allow advertisers to serve ads to Roku's users.

In July 2019, Roku started moving to a new headquarters in San Jose, with plans to vacate offices subleased from Netflix. In the same month, The Verge cited a "Strategy Analytics" report which showed that Roku was the most popular streaming platform in the United States in 2019, with over 30% share.

In April 2022, Roku was said to be launching a new ad program to allow advertisers to serve "targeted ads in real time". In May 2022, CNBC stated that research firm Conviva found Roku to be the market leader in U.S. TV streaming devices, while also reporting a new joint venture between Comcast and Charter. According to *Digiday* in September 2022, a market study by "Pixalate" found Roku devices to be the "No. 1" in the connected TV advertising market, with a 44% share of ad spend. In the same month, "Walmart Connect", Walmart's retail media platform, partnered with Roku to offer closed-loop measurement of the ads displayed on the Roku platform. In November 2022, Digiday referenced another study indicating that Roku held a market-leading 38.99% share of connected TV ad impressions, while also experiencing a slowdown in its advertising revenue.

### 2023–present: Advertising focus

In April 2023, online publisher *The Drum* reported that Roku was partnering with grocery delivery service Instacart to build tools to measure the effectiveness of brand advertising on the Roku platform. In particular, the partnership involved "linking" of Roku's proprietary viewership data to Instacart's sales data, and thereby informing brand advertisers when their streaming ads on Roku yield purchases on Instacart. That same month, Roku was reported to have topped the "CTV open programmatic ad traffic in North America" with nearly 50% market share, after falling by 4% over the preceding year. The company was also reported to have formed advertising partnerships with Best Buy, Cox Automotive, DoorDash, Kroger, Shopify, Spotify and Walmart. Additionally, Roku had partnered with Adobe, Analytic Partners, Ipsos MMA, IRI, Microsoft and Nielsen to gather insights towards measuring ad effectiveness in the broader internet environment.

In September 2023, a market study by *Beachfront Marketing* found that Roku had the largest share, nearly 40%, of connected TV ad impressions in the first half of the year. Later, in November 2023, Roku announced a partnership with app monetization platform Unity to assist performance-based advertising on the Roku platform.

In April 2024, Roku announced new partnerships with iSpot for ad measurement and The Trade Desk for ad targeting. Roku was also in an ad targeting partnership with Target by this time. That same month, *CNN* and The Verge reported that 576,000 Roku accounts were compromised in a cyberattack based on credential stuffing. This followed a previous security breach for the company earlier in the year affecting 15,000 accounts. According to Roku, hackers were able to make purchases on the Roku platform in fewer than 400 cases, and were not able to gain access to sensitive financial information. The company said that it was reversing charges and refunding all affected accounts. It also announced rolling out two-factor authentication across all Roku accounts to prevent such incidents in future.

In September 2024, Roku launched "Roku Ads Manager", a self-serve ad platform, claiming that the platform was a way for advertisers to buy and optimize advertisements. The company said it expected the platform to attract performance-oriented advertisers and offer ad targeting across all the streaming inventory available on Roku, including that coming from streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video, Max and Peacock. That same month, Mustafa Ozgen, Roku's "president of devices", stated that Roku remained committed to producing its namesake streaming players even as TV units were outselling streaming players. He also noted that the company’s "content business", which included advertising sales and revenue sharing from streaming services, generated more revenue than hardware sales.

In October 2024, Roku was identified as the leading connected TV (CTV) device both in the U.S. and globally. During the July-September 2024 period, Roku accounted for 37% of all open programmatic ads delivered in the U.S. as well as globally, a decrease from its 52% share during the same period in 2023. This decline was attributed to the expansion of the CTV market and increased competition from other CTV platforms, which had "opened up and attracted users". In November 2024, The Roku Channel held the highest share among all free-ad supported streaming services in the U.S., including Fox's Tubi (1.8%) and Paramount's Pluto TV (0.9%).

For the year 2024, Roku reported $4.1 billion in revenue, $129.3 million in net loss and $218.2 million in operating loss.

In January 2025, Roku announced the launch of the *Roku Data Cloud*, a service that provided marketers with detailed streaming TV data. This data was offered through third-party analytics services such as Omnicom and PMG, as well as ad measurement companies Innovid and iSpot. Roku also stated that an integration with Yahoo DSP was planned for the second half of 2025. At the time of the announcement, the company noted that although streaming TV outperformed linear TV, it still faced attribution challenges due to the absence of "clicks" on TV. Later, Nielsen's viewership data for January 2025 showed that The Roku Channel gathered 2.1% of all U.S. TV use and ranked as the fifth most-watched streaming service, trailing YouTube (10.8%), Netflix (8.6%) and Prime Video (3.7%).
