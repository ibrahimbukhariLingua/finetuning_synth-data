### July

* 2 July: Lost scenes from German-Austrian director Fritz Lang's legendary silent film "Metropolis" are discovered in Argentina. Paula Félix-Didier, head of film museum Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, discovered an uncut version of the 1927 science fiction film when she looked into reports that a tape in the archive was unusually long. She travelled to Berlin with a copy of the film and met with experts who say they are certain it is the missing original-length version of Lang's masterpiece that reveals key plot scenes and an expansion of minor roles, Die Zeit said.The Local
* 10 July: When the Teatro Colón, Latin America's most famous opera house, closed for refurbishment in November 2006, Buenos Aires city officials vowed that it would reopen in time for its centenary on May 25, 2008. But when the great day arrived, the theatre's golden proscenium arch was still in pieces on the floor, alongside plywood boards, while scaffolding rose the full 28 m (92 ft) height of its dome. To kick off the celebrations, the Colón's resident symphony orchestra was obliged to perform in a neighbouring theatre specialising in musicals, where it had to use microphones instead of relying on the opera house's fabulous natural acoustics.Economist.com
* 19 July: After months of standoff with irate farmers, and a humiliating defeat in the Senate, the government rolls back the extra levy on farm exports. The government rescinded Friday a controversial tax increase on grain exports that had sparked months of protests and bared deep divisions in one of the world's major food-producing nations.Los Angeles Times
* 23 July: Argentina replaces cabinet chief: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez names former head of the social security agency Sergio Massa as cabinet chief, in a shake-up just days after the Senate rejected a government tax hike on soy exports.Reuters

### August

* 12 August: Argentina's government announces a plan to buy back some of the country's debt, triggering a recovery in financial assets following the previous week's selloff. While news of the intervention props up markets, economists remain broadly pessimistic about President Cristina Kirchner's populist economic policies, which have stoked inflation, eroded Argentina's fiscal position and alienated the agribusiness sector that is the motor of the economy. That pessimism was reflected in a move by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's Corp. to lower Argentina's foreign and local currency long-term credit ratings to B from B+.Wall Street Journal
* 13 August: The Argentine Senate passes a law that defines alimentary disorders such as obesity, anorexia and bulimia, as diseases, and therefore medical insurers have to take care of the cost of their treatment Yahoo news, Diario Clarín.
