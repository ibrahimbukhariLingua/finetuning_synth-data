***IDEA: The Law Review of the Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property*** is a law review published by an independent student organization at the Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property at the University of New Hampshire School of Law.


## Overview

*IDEA: The Law Review of the Franklin Pierce Center for Intellectual Property* covers scholarly legal articles relating to patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, unfair competition, technology law, and general intellectual property issues. The Law Review publishes three issues each year.


## History

In June 1957, the Patent, Trademark and Copyright (PTC) Research Foundation at George Washington University published the first issue of *IDEA* under the name *Patent, Trademark and Copyright Journal of Research and Education*. In 1973, the Franklin Pierce Law Center, founded by Robert H. Rines, became home to the PTC Research Foundation as well as its student-run *Patent, Trademark & Copyright Journal of Research & Education*. In 1999, the PTC Research Foundation relocated to the Academy of Applied Science, but the student-run journal remained at the Pierce Law Center.

In 1977, the journal first incorporated the wordmark *IDEA* into its title. In 2002, the journal changed its name to *IDEA: The Intellectual Property Law Review*. In 2010, *IDEA* became a publication of the University of New Hampshire School of Law when the Franklin Pierce Law Center merged with the University of New Hampshire.
