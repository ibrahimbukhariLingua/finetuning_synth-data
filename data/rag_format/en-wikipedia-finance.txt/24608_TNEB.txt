## History

TNEB was formed on 1 July 1957 as the **Madras State Electricity Board** according to the Electricity Supply Act of 1948 as a successor to the erstwhile Electricity Department of the Government of Madras under the authority of the Department of Power. It was responsible for electricity generation, distribution and transmission, and it regulated the electricity supply in the state. Later it was renamed Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.

In October 2008, the Government of Tamil Nadu decided to divide TNEB into two subsidiaries. On 1 November 2010, TNEB Limited became a holding company with two subsidiaries, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO), responsible for power generation, and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO), responsible for power transmission.
