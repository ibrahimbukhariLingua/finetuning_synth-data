# National Economics University



**National Economics University** (**NEU**; Vietnamese: *Đại học Kinh tế Quốc dân*) is a public research university in Hanoi, Vietnam. Founded in 1956, its history and influence have made it the leading universities in Economics, Public Administration and Business Administration in Vietnam. NEU is now chairing a network of more than 40 universities in Vietnam in economics and business administration. It is also a prestigious research and consultation center with its publications and consulting works to the government of Vietnam on policy making and to the business community on business development. Since its establishment, NEU has paid special attention to developing international academic cooperation. It has formed partnership relationship with over 100 institutions and organizations from 30 countries, including Australia, Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Laos, Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Italy and United States. The university has been involved in research projects in cooperation with large governmental organizations and international financial institutions such as the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Foundation of Vietnam Development Forum (VDF), the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS), the World Bank (WB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Department for International Development (DFID - UK), and Ausaid (Australia). Many of the university's alumni have a strong track record of success and hold important positions in public and private sectors. Notable alumni include Nguyễn Văn Bình, former Prime Minister of Vietnam, and Đặng Ngọc Chấn, former Minister of Finance.

In 1956, the university was established by the government decree, originally named Central School of Economics and Finance.

In 1958, the school changed its name to University of Economics and Finance, under the supervision of Ministry of Education.

In 1962, Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng signed a decree to separate the Faculty of International Relations from the University of Economics and Finance and establish a new university called University of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, under the supervision of Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This later led to the foundation of two reputable institutions, Foreign Trade University, and Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam.

In 1965, the name was changed to University of Economic Planning.

In 1985, it was renamed National Economics University. It has kept this name since then.

For more than 60 years, the university has received numerous prestigious awards from the Vietnamese and Lao governments. More than 100,000 Bachelor's students, 10,000 Master's students, and 1,400 PhD students graduated from the university.

On November 15, 2024, Deputy Prime Minister Lê Thành Long, on behalf of the Prime Minister, signed a decision to elevate the National Economics University (Trường Đại học Kinh tế Quốc dân) to National Economics University (Đại học Kinh tế Quốc dân).

The government has mandated that the university reorganize its structure and operations in accordance with the Law on Higher Education and other relevant legal regulations.

The existing university council, its chairperson, and the university president will continue performing their duties as stipulated under current regulations until the Minister of Education and Training establishes the new university council, appoints the council chairperson, and recognizes the president of the newly upgraded National Economics University.

With this decision, the National Economics University becomes the ninth university-level institution in Vietnam. The other eight include:
- Vietnam National University, Hanoi
- Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City
- Thai Nguyen University
- Hue University
- University of Danang
- Hanoi University of Science and Technology
- University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City
- Duy Tan University

Previously, the university council of the National Economics University approved a resolution to establish three constituent schools: the School of Business, the School of Technology, and the School of Economics and Public Management.

Currently, the National Economics University has approximately 25,000 full-time students and over 1,200 faculty and staff members. It offers 60 undergraduate programs and 28 doctoral programs. As part of its development strategy for the 2021–2030 period, the university aims to rank among Vietnam's top five universities.

Under the 2018 Law on Higher Education, "university" (đại học) and "college" (trường đại học) are distinct concepts. A college provides education in multiple disciplines but does not encompass diverse fields, whereas a university offers education across various fields, with each field having multiple disciplines. Therefore, a university typically comprises several colleges.

According to Decree 99/2019/ND-CP, which details the implementation of amendments to the Law on Higher Education, institutions must meet specific conditions to transition from a college to a university-level institution.
