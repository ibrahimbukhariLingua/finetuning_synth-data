In 2015, the Reserve Bank of India commenced the Small Finance Bank (SFB) category in India to encourage financial inclusion. Of the 72 companies that applied for the SFB license, 10 received licenses. AU Bank was the only non-banking finance company to receive this license.

Agarwal was first appointed as managing director of Au Financiers on 14 February 2008. As the company transformed into a Small Finance Bank on 19 April 2017, he became the Managing Director & CEO of AU Small Finance Bank.

In 2017, the IPO of the AU Bank was oversubscribed by more than 53 times. As of May 2021, the bank has a valuation of close to ₹30,000 crore (US$4 billion). Sanjay's market wealth is about ₹11,597.04 crore (US$1 billion).
