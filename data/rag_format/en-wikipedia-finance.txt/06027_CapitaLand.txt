## History

On 12 July 2000, DBS Land (DBSL) and Pidemco Land announced a merger to form a company eventually owning about $18 billion in assets, making it the largest listed property company in Southeast Asia when completed. Although this followed a new measure imposed by Monetary Authority of Singapore to separate financial and non-financial activities of banking groups on 21 June 2000, DBS Bank had already divested most of its investments in DBSL and was holding 5.4% of DBSL, well below the 20% shareholding threshold for non-core banking activities under the new measure. More details of the merged entity were given on 31 July 2000. Named as CapitaLand on 6 September 2000, the merger was approved by shareholders on 18 October 2000 and was thus officially launched on 28 November 2000.

In 2002, CapitaLand's portfolio of REITs expanded to include CapitaLand Ascott Trust, CapitaLand China Trust, CapitaLand Ascendas REIT, CapitaLand India Trust and CapitaLand Malaysia Trust.

On 13 September 2012, CapitaLand announced that it was listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index in recognition of its sustainability efforts. It has been listed on the Index since then.

In 2017, CapitaLand came into controversy when the company attempted to evict the Franses Art Gallery from the Cavendish Hotel in London. CapitaLand acquired the property in August 2012. The case would go to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which ruled against CapitaLand and upheld Franses Art Gallery's request for a new 15-year lease.

On 14 January 2019, the Group announced that it would acquire Ascendas-Singbridge, a real estate group, from Temasek Holdings in an S$11B deal, which was completed on 30 June 2019. On 3 July 2019, it announced that Ascott Residence Trust (Ascott Reit) and Ascendas Hospitality Trust would be merged into The Ascott Limited, forming Asia's largest hospitality trust with S$7.6b in combined assets.

On 29 September 2020, unitholders of CapitaLand Mall Trust and CapitaLand Commercial Trust voted in favour of the merger of both REITs to form CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, which would become the largest Singapore REIT and one of the largest REITs in the Asia Pacific with an asset base of S$22.4 billion.

On 22 March 2021, CapitaLand Group announced the proposed restructuring of its business. With the restructuring, the Group formed two entities – CapitaLand Investment (CLI), the real estate investment management business which was listed on SGX-ST on 20 September 2021 and CapitaLand Development (CLD), the privatised property development arm.

On the 20th of September 2021, CLI debuted on the Singapore Stock Exchange under the trading name CapitaLandInvest and stock code, 9CI.

On 27 September 2021, CapitaLand announced the change of names of Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust, Ascott Residence Trust and Ascendas India Trust under one unified CapitaLand brand. Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust was renamed to CapitaLand Ascendas REIT. Ascott Residence Trust was renamed to CapitaLand Ascott Trust. Ascendas India Trust was renamed to CapitaLand India Trust.

CapitaLand Ascendas REIT brought its London data centre footprint to five in 2023 by buying the 31MW Chess Building data centre from Digital Realty for £125.1m ($159m).

In March 2024, CapitaLand India Trust acquired an industrial property from developer Nalanda Shelter Private in the Indian state of Pune for 7.73bn Indian rupees (€86m).

Also in March 2024, Amsterdam-based Bouwinvest Real Estate Investors invested $75 million for the $600 million CapitaLand Ascott Residence Asia Fund II (CLARA II).
