Diet rewards


# Diet rewards



**Diet rewards** are incentives, such as cash payments, to individuals to maintain good health and wellness by a healthy diet, particularly a diet aimed at reaching a healthy weight. This has been a trend in both the US and the UK.
*The Biggest Loser* reality TV series increased public awareness of the idea of losing weight for cash and the importance of regular weigh-ins.


## Evidence of effectiveness

Several academic studies have concluded that financial incentives are effective for producing weight loss.
The Kevin G. Volpp et al. study found that dieters with incentives were five times more likely to reach their goal. How incentives are delivered appears to play a role in their effectiveness. In a 2016 study, insurance premium adjustments as high as $550 were shown to be ineffective in driving weight loss.
