## History

Fountain Tire was founded in 1956 by Bill Fountain. The company started as a small, double-bay garage in Wainwright, Alberta, and offered in-the-field service to farmers. As it grew, Bill Fountain decided to offer local managers 50 percent equity in their stores, a practice still in use today.

In 1976, Bill Fountain was killed in a car accident, leaving behind a network of 19 stores and partners.

The 1980s included further expansion for Fountain Tire: a move to the new head office in Edmonton and a change in Fountain Tire's expansion strategy. On September 24, 1987, Fountain Tire sold 49 percent of its business to Goodyear Canada. By the end of the 1990s, 100 new Fountain Tire stores had been added across Western Canada.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
