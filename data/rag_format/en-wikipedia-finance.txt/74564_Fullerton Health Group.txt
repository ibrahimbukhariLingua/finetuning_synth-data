Fullerton Health Group


# Fullerton Health Group



**Fullerton Health** is an integrated enterprise healthcare service provider founded in 2010 in Singapore. The company specializes in designing customized medical services for corporate and insurer clients. Fullerton Health began with an initial investment in corporate healthcare providers Gethin-Jones and Drs Trythall Hoy Davies. Over the years, they grew through both organic growth and investments and mergers and acquisitions.

Fullerton Health made 3 major acquisitions in 2015 which helped grow its presence in both existing and new markets. In May, their subsidiary, Global Assistance & Healthcare (GAH) acquired PT JLT GESA, more commonly known as Medilum, that provides managed healthcare and third-party administration services. Later in August, they bought an 80 percent stake in Hong Kong medical provider, HMMP Limited (HMMP), for SGD$33 million. Above all, the purchase of Radlink-Asia in Singapore for SGD$111.2 million marked its entry into the advanced medical diagnostic imaging market and allowed it to cut costs through the digitisation of processes.

As of June 30, 2016, Fullerton Health owns 198 clinics and facilities across Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Malaysia, has close to 2,000 employees and sees an annual revenue of more than S$300 million.
