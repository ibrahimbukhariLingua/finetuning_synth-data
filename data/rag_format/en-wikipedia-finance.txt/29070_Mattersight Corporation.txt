In 2011, TeleTech acquired the Integrated Contact Solutions unit of eLoyalty. The behavioral analytics unit launched as Mattersight Corporation.

## Service

Mattersight provides a software-as-a-service using predictive customer analytics, speech analytics, and behavioral analytics technologies to analyze and improve contact center performance and agent interactions. It uses a data analysis system that listens to the way customers respond on the telephone, analyzing communication patterns, grammar, word choice, tone, volume, pauses, and other communication metrics. Mathematical algorithms then interpret vocal features, compare them to their databases, and arrive at a personality profile for each customer, who is then matched with a service agent with whom the customer is most compatible.
