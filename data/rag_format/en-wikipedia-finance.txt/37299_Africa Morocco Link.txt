Africa Morocco Link


# Africa Morocco Link



**Africa Morocco Link** (**AML**) is a ferry company in Morocco founded in 2016. The company operates ferry services between Tangier in Morocco and Algeciras in Spain.


## History

AML was created in 2016 following an agreement between BMCE Bank and Attica Holdings to operate scheduled ferry services from Morocco to Europe, under AML. Attica Group will hold a 49% participation in the new company, while 51% will be held by a group of Moroccan shareholders, led by BMCE Bank Of Africa Group. AML inaugurated operations between Almeria and Nador on 15 October 2016 with the MV *Diagoras* sailing at 13:00 from Almeria. This is their second line connecting Morocco with Europe since the start of their operations in 2016. *Diagoras* left AML's fleet on 26 December 2017.

In April 2024 BMCE Bank sold their 51% share to CTM.

The following days also Attica Group announced the sale of their 49% share to Stena Line.
