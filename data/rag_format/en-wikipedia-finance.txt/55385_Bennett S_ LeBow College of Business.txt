Bennett S. LeBow College of Business


# Bennett S. LeBow College of Business



The **LeBow College of Business** (/ləˈboʊ/), often referred to simply as **Drexel LeBow**, is the business school of Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The school offers undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs in business administration to nearly 4,000 students and encompasses an alumni network of more than 40,000 business professionals.


## History

The LeBow College of Business traces its origins to the founding of the Drexel Institute in 1891 and the establishment of the Business Department in 1896. Business programs at Drexel underwent a series of transformations throughout the 20th century, which saw the department recast itself as the Drexel Secretarial School in 1914 and the Drexel School of Business Administration in 1922. By 1974, the College of Business and Administration had been formed to house all of Drexel University's business, finance, and economics programs.

In 1999, Drexel University alumnus Bennett S. LeBow donated $10 million to the College of Business and Administration. This donation represented the largest individual contribution to the university in its history, a fact that was recognized by the renaming of the College of Business and Administration in LeBow's honor. That year, the school officially became known as the Bennett S. LeBow College of Business.

A second donation by LeBow, totaling $45 million, became the university's new record-setting donation from an individual donor in 2010. The donation was used for the construction of Gerri C. LeBow Hall, a new, 12-story facility that replaced the aging Matheson Hall and became the central hub of Drexel University's business programs upon its dedication on October 3, 2013.

In May 2022, a $10 million pledge was gifted to the university from alumnus Ronald W. and Kathleen Disney. This was the second largest pledge to the business school by an individual and was provided with the aim of providing scholarship funds and program support for students from underrepresented backgrounds.
