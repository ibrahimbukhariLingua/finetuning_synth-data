# Bulgarian Postbank



**Postbank** (Bulgarian: Пощенска Банка, Poshtenska Banka), legally known as **Eurobank Bulgaria AD** (former legal name Eurobank EFG Bulgaria AD, date of change 11/1/2013), is a universal bank in Bulgaria.


## History

Bulgarian Postbank was founded on April 2, 1991 as the postal savings system of Bulgarian Posts. In the years that followed, the bank experienced substantial growth and expansion. It is one of the few Bulgarian banks that managed to survive the banking crisis in Bulgaria in 1996–1997.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On November 9, 1998, 78.23% of Postbank's capital was acquired by ALICO/CEH Balkan Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary of Eurobank Ergasias. In the following years, Eurobank Ergasias control grew to more than 90% of Postbank's equity capital.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On December 21, 2006, Eurobank EFG acquired majority ownership of the Bulgarian DZI Bank, which was merged into Postbank in the third quarter of 2007 with the operational merger completing by the end of the year.

On August 29, 2011, Eurobank Ergasias and Alpha Bank announced that they have reached agreement on a merger. Alpha Bank has presence in Bulgaria since 1995 with its Sofia Branch having more than 120 offices around the country. The Alpha Bank Branch was expected to merge into Postbank operationally in 2012, but in January 2012, the merger was suspended until private sector bond writedowns, required of Greek banks as part of the EU/International Monetary Fund third rescue package to resolve the Greek government debt crisis, are finalized. The merger went through on 17 July 2015.

Following its merger with DZI Bank in 2007, the bank changed its legal name to "Eurobank Bulgaria AD", but continued doing business as the Bulgarian Postbank.

In March 2016, Postbank acquired the Bulgarian operations of the Greek Alpha Bank, becoming the fourth-largest bank in Bulgaria in terms of loans and deposits. In July 2018, Eurobank acquired Piraeus Bank Bulgaria, placing Postbank among the three largest lenders of the country.
