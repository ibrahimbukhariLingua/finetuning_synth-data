Born the son of Benjamin Greene, of Bury St Edmunds, a slave owner and in the 1790s founder of what became the Greene King brewery, one of the largest brewing businesses in England. Greene was educated at King Edward VI School.

In 1829 Greene went to Saint Kitts to look after his father's cotton and sugar plantations (acquired in 1823), which were worked by slaves and were highly profitable. The family also owned ships carrying sugar exports. Greene remained in St Kitts until 1837. The Greenes acquired several sugar plantations in the Caribbean, in St Kitts, Montserrat and Antigua, which they either owned or managed. They eventually run 18 estates.

Benjamin senior established with his son Benjamin Greene & Son, West India merchants and shipowners, at 11 Mincing Lane. Through his wife's family connections, Greene formed a partnership with James and Henry Blyth, who controlled much of the external trade and sugar production of Mauritius, in 1846. Blyths and Greene, merchants and shipowners, became one of London's largest colonial merchants and shipowners.

Elected a Bank of England director from 1850 to 1900, he became Deputy Governor in 1871 and went on to become Governor in 1873. Greene's tenure as Governor occurred during the Panic of 1873. He died at his home in Berkshire on 3 April 1902.

When the ownership of slaves was finally abolished in the British Empire in 1833, the government paid compensation for slavery - not to the enslaved people, but to the slaveholders. The government paid £20m, 40% of the HM Treasury's annual spending budget (£17 billion in today's terms) in compensation. This vast sum of borrowed money was only finally repaid in 2015. In June 2020, during the global protests following the murder of George Floyd, the Bank of England issued a public apology for the involvement of Greene, amongst of some of its past governors and directors in the slave trade.
