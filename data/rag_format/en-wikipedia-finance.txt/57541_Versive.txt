## Product

Versive has developed a platform that ingests data, determines what's important, and creates a problem-specific solution that can be deployed while continually learning. The proprietary high-performance machine learning technology accelerates deployment of machine learning solutions.

Problem-specific applications provide an experience that reduces the workload on users building complicated models. Deployment options include public or private clouds, traditional servers, and Hadoop clusters.

Versive's software has been applied in various industries. The information gathered through the technology aims to help clients predict activity based on observed trends. The technology can be used to help security teams detect advanced cyber threats, and won the Best Emerging Security Product at Interop in May 2017. It is useful for calculating prices and other risks. The system can also detect fraud.
