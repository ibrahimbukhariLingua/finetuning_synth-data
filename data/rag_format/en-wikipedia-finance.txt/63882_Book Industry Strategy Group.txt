# Book Industry Strategy Group



**The Australian Book Industry Strategy Group** (**BISG**) was an initiative of the Australian government to examine the impact of the digital age on the country's book publishing industry.


## Background

Then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, established the Australian Book Industry Strategy Group in 2010. The group conducted market analysis research, took public submissions and held Stakeholder Workshops in which over 200 industry representatives participated.
