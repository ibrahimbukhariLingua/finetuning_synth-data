EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht


# EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht



**EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht** (literally "university for business and law"), more commonly referred to as **EBS Universität** or simply **EBS**, is a state-recognized private research university specializing in the disciplines of business and law. The university is located in Wiesbaden and Oestrich-Winkel, Germany. EBS is considered to be one of the most prestigious institutions for law and business studies in the German-speaking world, being particularly renowned in the finance and consulting industry.

The university was founded in 1971 as European Business School, thereby making it the oldest private business school in Germany, and its activities focus on three core areas: undergraduate degree programs, postgraduate degree programs, and executive education. With the foundation of its law faculty in 2010, the former European Business School was awarded full university status in 2011, forming the EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht.

EBS is known as one of the most thriving universities for entrepreneurs in Germany. Start-ups of EBS Alumni include Vapiano, Lieferando, Foodspring. Notable alumni are the CEO of Goldman Sachs for Germany, Austria and Switzerland (Dr. Wolfgang Fink), SVP and Chief Business Officer at Google (Philipp Schindler), former CEO of Puma (Jochen Zeitz), or former CEO of Deutsche Telekom AG (Kai-Uwe Ricke).

Among the university's corporate partners, one can find McKinsey, Bertelsmann, Clifford Chance, Mercedes-Benz AG, or UBS. Academic partnerships include UC Berkeley, Bocconi University, CEIBS, Sciences Po, National University of Singapore, and McGill University.

Its current president is Günther Oettinger, former EU Commissioner and former Minister-president of the state of Baden-Württemberg.


## History

EBS was founded in Offenbach am Main as a University of Applied Sciences by Klaus Evard in 1971. The young institution was named the European Business School. The original concept provided for a European-style leadership training program with three locations in France, England, and Germany. To this day, the EBS study program is characterized by several practical periods of study abroad, integrated semesters abroad, and a school-based structure. In 1980 the School moved to Schloss Reichartshausen in Oestrich-Winkel in the Rheingau. In 1985 a second university building (the "Burg") was added in Oestrich-Winkel.

In 1989 it was awarded higher education status, 1992 it was recognized as a scientific university by the Hessian Minister of Science. This step was followed by the separation of EBS Schloss Reichartshausen from the international network of European Business Schools, which had developed into a network in the 1980s. Since then, EBS has been cooperating with independent universities worldwide. In 1993 it was awarded the right to confer doctoral degrees and in 1998 the right to confer post-doctoral (professorial) qualifications.

On 16 June 2010, the EBS Law School was founded as a second faculty alongside the EBS Business School, and "Universität in Gründung" (University under formation) status was gained. The EBS Law School is located in Wiesbaden and is the official seat of EBS Universität. Since September 2011 the EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht has the official status of a university.

New EBS students caught attention in September 2010 as they over-consumed alcohol in September 2010 in close proximity to the university as part of a freshman ritual.

The founding of the EBS Law School should initially be funded by the state of Hesse and the city of Wiesbaden with 25 million Euros, but actually required 50 million Euros. At the end of April the Hessian Ministry for Science announced that they would examine the reports on the expenditure of funds and to freeze all aid money, leading to a repayment of around 2% of that amount, which were used for other causes than for the startup of the law school. Inquiries by state prosecutors because of a potential fraud at the expense of the State of Hesse led to a state prosecutor raid of the offices and flats of leading EBS management staff on April 9, 2014. Both related preliminary proceedings against all parties for an administrative offence pursuant to Section 170 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been discontinued because the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt has not established sufficient suspicion.

In December 2018 the third EBS Executive School faculty was founded.


## Campus

The EBS maintains a total of three locations for teaching, research, and administrative purposes. The two largest campuses are located in Wiesbaden and Oestrich-Winkel.
