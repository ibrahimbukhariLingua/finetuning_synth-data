# Nordic Capital



**Nordic Capital** is a global private equity firm focused on leveraged buyouts of established companies in Northern Europe and North America.

Founded in 1989, the firm manages about $40 billion of capital, with offices in New York, London, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Helsinki, and Oslo.

Nordic Capital targets buyouts of large and medium-size companies across 4 core industries: Technology & Payments, Healthcare, Financial Services, and Services & Industrial Technology.

Nordic Capital is one of the 25 largest private equity firms worldwide according to Private Equity International's PEI 300 ranking, with over $30 billion of capital raised within a 5-year period.

In October 2022, Nordic Capital announced the successful closing of its 11th large-cap buyout fund at its hard cap of EUR 9 billion (USD $10 billion), exceeding its €8 billion target. The fund is over 45% larger than its predecessor large-cap fund (Nordic Capital Fund X), which raised €6.1 billion in 2020. The fund closed in only nine months amidst some of the most challenging fundraising conditions in private equity history, and was the largest Europe-based private equity fund raised that year.
