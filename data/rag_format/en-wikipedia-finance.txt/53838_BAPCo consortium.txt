## Controversy

BAPco has suffered criticism for bias in its benchmarking products. It was found in 2002 that Intel was the sole contributor to a series of CPU tests, tests which heavily favoured their own CPUs vs competitors, where the tests of the year before performed significantly better on non-Intel parts. In 2011, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nividia left BAPCo with AMD claiming that the SYSmark benchmark was biased toward Intel. Intel was investigated by the FTC, and eventually fined for this action, among other anti-competitive measures.
