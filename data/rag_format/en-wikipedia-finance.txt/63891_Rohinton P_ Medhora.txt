## Development economics

Early in his career, Medhora's work focused on development economics. During his time at IDRC, Medhora focused particularly on development finance. He argued that policy makers should avoid “cookie cutter” approaches to economic policy in developing economies. In other words, what works for one country – be it developed or otherwise – may not work in other contexts. His major publications in this area are:

* [With R. Blundell and C. Heady], "Labour Markets in an Era of Adjustment: the Case of Côte d'Ivoire", in S. Horton, R. Kanbur, and D. Mazumdar, eds., *Labour Markets in an* *Era of Adjustment*, Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 1994.

## Multilateralism

Medhora argues that strong multilateral institutions are important for effective global governance. He points to institutions like the G20, the IMF and the WTO as examples of institutions that have the potential to make positive contributions to global well being. He also identifies trade negotiations as a potential forum for multilateral global governance, and argues that trade agreements have the potential to be mechanisms for addressing diverse challenges. In this field, his publications include:

* "International Cooperation: Is the Multilateral System Helping?" *CIGI Paper* No. 218, June 2019.

## Innovation policy

Medhora has argued that, in an economy increasingly driven by intangible assets, public policy should be oriented towards promoting the production of intellectual property. Along with promoting innovation, he argues that international governance frameworks are needed in order to ensure artificial intelligence and big data are deployed ethically. To address the challenges and opportunities of the new economy, Medhora has called for a “Bretton Woods moment” in which international consensus is formed around the principle that the technology-fuelled economy should serve the global good. His major publications in this area are :

* "Rethinking Policy in a Digital World," *CIGI Policy Brief No. 143,* November 2015.
* "Data Governance in the Digital Age," *CIGI Special Report*, May 2018.
* "New Thinking on Innovation," *CIGI Special Report*, November 2017.
