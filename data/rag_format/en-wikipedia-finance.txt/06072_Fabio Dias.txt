# Fabio Dias



**Fabio Dias** is a Brazilian computer scientist, entrepreneur and academic. He is known for his role structuring exchange-traded notes listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange and supporting them with a robo-advisory platform of his authorship. He also teaches financial modelling and applied computer science disciplines at the University of Surrey.


## Education

Born in Brazil, Dias learned computer programming independently while doing his secondary education, getting a job as a software developer. He obtained a BSc in Computer Science from the University of São Paulo and a Master of Science in Statistics from the same university. He completed his PhD in Econometrics and Statistical Science at the University College London.


## Career

He relocated from Brazil to the United Kingdom, joining the technology department of Credit Suisse and later moving to a risk management role at Lloyds Banking Group. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he was appointed to an academic role at the University of Surrey.

After exiting the banking industry, Dias used results from joint research with Gareth W. Peters regarding machine learning on stock market prediction to set up an investment company, using exchange-traded notes in conjunction with robotic advisory services to aid investments by retail investors.

Dias' business employs automation and use of artificial intelligence.

His activities have been subject of criticism in his home country, with academics from the Federal University of Piauí stating that Dias "could have made better use of technological advances in a way that generates investment within Brazil itself."
