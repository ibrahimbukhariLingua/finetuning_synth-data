Bridger Aerospace


# Bridger Aerospace



**Bridger Aerospace** is an American aerospace company which provides aerial firefighting and wildfire management services. The company has supported firefighting efforts in 24 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.

In January 2023, Bridger went public via SPAC merger with a valuation of $869 million. The company has not been profitable since going public.


## History

The company was founded in 2014 by Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL who utilized airborne surveillance during his service. Initially, Sheehy operated one plane to assist ranchers with tracking their cattle from the air. He shifted the company's focus to aerial firefighting during the 2015 wildfire season.

In 2018, Bridger was one of four companies awarded a contract with the United States Department of the Interior to use drones in emergency situations, including during wildfires. It became the first private company to legally use drones for wildfire fighting during the Martin Fire in Nevada, mapping 435,000 acres of burned land in 11 flight runs.

By August 2019 the company had grown to a fleet of 20 aircraft and a staff of 100.

In March 2020, Bridger Aerospace offered its fleet to healthcare workers for moving supplies and patients as a response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The company also manufactured face shields that it donated to frontline workers and used its fleet to deliver other personal protection equipment to medical personnel throughout Montana.

Bridger was the launch customer for the De Havilland CL-415EAF Firefighting Aircraft.

In 2024, Tim Sheehy resigned as CEO to focus on his candidacy in the U.S. Senate election in Montana, which he later won.


## Operations

The company is headquartered in Belgrade, Montana and provides aerial firefighting services to government agencies, including the United States Forest Service, across the U.S. Its planes are used for fire suppression and it uses unmanned aerial vehicles to map and provide surveillance of fires. The drones provide fire crews with information including infrared imagery of active fires, and support communication with and tracking of firefighters on the ground.
