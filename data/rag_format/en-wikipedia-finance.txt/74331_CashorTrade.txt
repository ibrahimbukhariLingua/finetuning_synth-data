# CashorTrade



**CashorTrade** is a fan-to-fan face-value ticket-reselling market created in 2009 by brothers Brando and Dusty Rich based in Burlington, Vermont. As of November 2017ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the platform had users from 20 countries and had processed over half a million transactions. The platform offers an optional gold membership which provides early notice of available tickets for an annual fee.

CashorTrade does not allow ticket-scalping (reselling tickets above the original price). The marketplace is user-policed; tickets sold above face value are flagged and removed. CashorTrade works with many artists and non-profits dedicated to keeping resale tickets at face value, including Twiddle, Greensky Bluegrass, Billy Strings, The Osiris Podcast Network, The Waterwheel Foundation and Phish.
