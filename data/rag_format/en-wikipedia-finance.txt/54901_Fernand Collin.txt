**Fernand Collin** (Antwerp, 18 December 1897 – 11 December 1990), was a Belgian businessman. He was president of the Kredietbank from 1938 to 1973 and was also a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven.

At the start of World War II, Fernand Collin, together with Alexandre Galopin (Société Générale de Belgique) and Max-Léo Gérard (Banque de Bruxelles) were given a mandate to manage the Belgian economy during the war. Paul-Henri Spaak told them in May 1940 *Nous vous confions la Belgique* (E: We trust you with Belgium).

He was CEO of the pudding producing company *Imperial Products*, which merged in 1968 with *Devos Lemmens [nl]* into *Continental Foods* (it was sold to Campbell Soup in 1985). In 1962, he published an article in the Yale Law Journal, where in a note on the *Unit of Account* he expanded on the idea of a European currency in order to *revitalize the international money markets*.
