Together with Ross Levinsohn, Adam Bain and Michael Kirby, Katz founded Fox Interactive Media, and was given a "war chest of $2 billion" to acquire digital businesses, including MySpace, Photobucket, Rotten Tomatoes, and IGN. Within a year of launching the business, Fox Interactive Media had overtaken Yahoo! to be the most visited property on the Internet.

### BrightDrop

In 2020, Katz joined as founding CEO and President of BrightDrop, a new electric vehicle company, backed by General Motors, targeting commercial delivery. The vision was to combine the speed and agility of a Silicon Valley startup with GM's scale and strengths in manufacturing and supply chain. GM committed $800M up front to get the venture off the ground and build out the factory in Ingersol, Ontario.

Under Katz's leadership, the company delivered its first electric vehicles, the Zevo 600, to FedEx in December 2021, just twenty months from the vehicle's conception, making it the fastest vehicle to market in GM's history. BrightDrop secured contracts with FedEx, Walmart and Merchants Fleet, as well as an agreement to develop service vehicles for Verizon. In November, 2022, GM announced BrightDrop was on track to deliver $1 billion in revenue in 2023, making it one of the fastest companies in history to achieve this milestone.

In November, 2023, following a commitment by GM to cut $3B in expenses, the company announced it was reorganizing its BrightDrop electric commercial vehicle unit to make it less independent from GM, but would continue to manufacture the BrightDrop vans. It announced that Katz would be leaving at an unspecified date, but did not elaborate on the reason for his departure.
