## History

In 2008, Indian Premier League, a franchise based T20 tournament was launched by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Chennai Super Kings (CSK) was acquired by India Cements, a company owned by N.Srinivasan, then president of BCCI. The BCCI had an existing clause in its regulations which prohibited administrators of BCCI from holding commercial interests in the matches conducted by the board. This was modified to enable the ownership of franchises in the IPL by members linked to the BCCI. In 2014, the Supreme Court of India admitted a petition which challenged the amendment and cited conflict of interest. Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited was incorporated on 19 December 2014. To avoid complications arising out of the conflict of interest case, the ownership of CSK was transferred to the new company. The amendment to the BCCI clause was later voided by the Supreme Court of India in 2016.
