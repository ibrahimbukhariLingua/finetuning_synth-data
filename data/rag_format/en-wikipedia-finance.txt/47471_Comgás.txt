# Comgás



**Companhia de Gás de São Paulo - Comgás** is a Brazilian gas distributor focused on São Paulo state. It is Brazil's biggest gas distributor, with around 1,6 million residential, commercial and industrial customers, as of 2016, who receive gas through about 14.000 kilometres (8.699 mi) of pipelines. Comgás was founded in 1872. The company had been wholly owned by the São Paulo state-owned power generation utility, *Companhia Energética de São Paulo* until April 1999, when CESP's stake was sold to the British BG Group and to Royal Dutch Shell. Comgas sells gas under a 30-year franchise, with a potential for a further 20 years.

Comgás distributes piped gas to more than 1.7 million consumers in the residential, commercial, industrial, automotive, cogeneration and thermogeneration segments in 88 cities in its concession area - São Paulo Metropolitan Region, Vale do Paraíba, Baixada Santista and Campinas Administrative Region.

Brazilian conglomerate Cosan owns 61.73% of Comgas's stock, and Shell 17.12%. The remainder is publicly traded on B3. Cosan acquired its stake from BG Group in November 2012 for $1.7 billion.
