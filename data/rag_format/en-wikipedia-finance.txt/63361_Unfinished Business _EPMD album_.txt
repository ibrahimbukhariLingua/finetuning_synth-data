Unfinished Business (EPMD album)


# Unfinished Business (EPMD album)



***Unfinished Business*** is the second album by hip hop duo EPMD. Released July 25, 1989, the album built upon the success of the group's previous album *Strictly Business*, which was released the previous year. The lead single, "So Wat Cha Sayin'," was the only charting single released from the album. It was the second album from the group to hit No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on October 16, 1989. It was one of three albums that Priority/EMI Records acquired from Sleeping Bag Records when it ceased operations in 1991; the other two were EPMD's debut, *Strictly Business*, and Nice & Smooth’s self-titled album. The rest of the Fresh/Sleeping Bag Records catalog was acquired by Warlock Records.

*Trouser Press* wrote that "the rudimentary self-production of *Unfinished Business* is its most engaging asset: Sermon and his largely silent partner Parrish Smith (the band’s acronym stands for Erick and Parrish Making Dollars) sound like a couple of kids fooling around in mom’s basement, rapping about nothing, singing a line or two, making cut-in jokes with some favorite records and generally amusing themselves while the tape runs."

In 1998, the album was selected as one of *The Source'*s 100 Best Rap Albums and, in 2005, was ranked No. 7 on comedian Chris Rock's Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all-time list for *Rolling Stone*.
