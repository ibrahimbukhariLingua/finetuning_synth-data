Unhaggle


# Unhaggle



**Unhaggle** is a Canadian automotive buying, pricing, and data company.

The company was founded in 2011 by Andrew Tai, Radek Garbowski, Neal Shah, and Leslie Wong.
Through Unhaggle, car buyers can view what others paid for the car they want in their local area and look up dealer invoice price reports for free, which reflect the manufacturer's wholesale price. There is also a paid service that gets dealers within a specific geographic area to compete against each other, to give buyers who do not wish to negotiate their best price.
Dealers pay for the privilege of knowing you are looking for a particular car.


## Early history

Before starting Unhaggle, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Tai had a job in the finance sector, working at Morgan Stanley and then at a private equity firm in Toronto. In 2011, he teamed up with Radek Garbowski, Neal Shah, and Leslie Wong, fellow graduates from Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario, to start Unhaggle.
The company's headquarters is located in Toronto.
