## History


### 19th century

Morgan Lewis was founded in Philadelphia on March 10, 1873, by Civil War veteran Charles Eldridge Morgan, Jr., who later served as the Philadelphia Law Academy's vice president, and Francis Draper Lewis, son of a wholesale dry goods merchant, whose first cousin was William Draper Lewis, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

In 1883, Morgan & Lewis hired Morris Rex Bockius, who had graduated in June of that year with Master of Arts and Bachelor of Law degrees from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He became a partner fifteen years after he joined the firm, which he then led until his death in 1939. The firm became Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in 1908, though it is still commonly referred to by its sobriquet, "Morgan Lewis."

The firm began representing the United Gas Improvement Company, later UGI, in 1882; it became the largest gas and electric utility company in the United States and remained a client of the firm well over a century later. From the early 20th century, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius represented many other companies, including Philadelphia's largest daily newspaper, The *Philadelphia Bulletin*; Pennsylvania's largest railroad, Baldwin Locomotive Works; Scott Paper; and several major banks and trust companies.


### 20th century

In 1963, Morgan Lewis hired its first female law associate, Gail McKnight Beckman, daughter of Pennsylvania's Deputy Secretary of Banking Irland McKnight Beckman and family psychology author Elizabeth B. Hurlock,. In 1980, Stephanie Abramson became its first female law partner; she is now adjunct professor of clinical law and director of law and business experiential classes at New York University School of Law.


### 21st century

Morgan, Lewis & Bockius was the original holder of the web domain name MLB.com. In September 2000, they agreed to transfer the domain name to Major League Baseball. Elected in 2015, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred is an alumnus of the firm.

In 2014, following the chairmanships of Thomas Lefevre, then Francis "Fran" Milone, Jami Wintz McKeon–-who had started with the firm in 1981-–was elected to chair Morgan Lewis, distinguishing her as leading the largest female-chaired law firm in the world. Re-elected in 2018, McKeon is a proponent of work flexibility, such as remote work, and has received numerous professional awards, including (in 2017) being named a "Client Service All-Star" by BTT Consulting Group and a "Business Hall of Fame Icon" by *The Philadelphia Inquirer*. During McKeon's tenure, the firm has continued to scale its national and international presence, growing into one of the largest law firms in the world. Under her leadership, the firm also has been recognized annually with Gold Standard Certification by the Women in Law Empowerment Forum (WILEF).

In 2012 Ted Cruz, a Morgan Lewis partner and head of the U.S. Supreme Court and Appellate Litigation practice, left Morgan Lewis upon becoming a United States Senator.

In 2015, Morgan Lewis filed a historic *amicus* brief for the definitive Supreme Court case of Obergefell v. Hodges, on behalf of 379 companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and the New England Patriots, which argued "a business case for legalizing same-sex marriage across the country." Partner Susan Baker Manning, who authored the brief, in 2018 was added as a full-time senior trial lawyer to the firm's *pro bono* group led by senior counsel Rachel Strong, with focus remaining primarily on refugee and civil rights, and "issue-based litigation", according to firm chair Jami McKeon. The firm is an affiliate firm of the Minority Corporate Counsel Association (MCCA).

In February 2018, Morgan Lewis published findings of its investigation into sexual harassment at NPR, led by the head the firm's labor and employment group, partner Grace Speights, with partner Margaret Rodgers Schmidt and associate Jocelyn Cuttino; this precipitated the apologetic resignation of NPR's senior vice-president of news, Michael Oreskes. Morgan Lewis recommendations were noted as offering "broad guidance for companies that are taking fresh looks at their own practices." That same month, Wayne Pacelle, former CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, also resigned amid similar allegations, while under investigation by the firm; *The National Law Journal* referenced Morgan Lewis as working on the "front lines" in representing cases central to "long-overdue reforms in workplaces toxic to women."

In April 2018, former Morgan Lewis partner John Ring was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for a seat on the National Labor Relations Board, one of several firm partners who have served on the NLRB, including Harry Johnson and senior counsel Charles Cohen.

In March 2019, Chai Feldblum, former Equal Employment Opportunity Commission member and lead drafter of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, became a partner of Morgan Lewis, then stating to *Bloomberg Law* that the move from public service to a "Big Law management-side firm", considered unusual, was the best way to help employers implement the workplace harassment guidelines outlined by herself and Victoria Lipnic at the EEOC, describing the firm as "the place from which to help make that institutional change”, of preventing harassment in the workplace.

In November 2023, amid a wave of antisemitic incidents at elite U.S. law schools, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius was among a group of major law firms who sent a letter to top law school deans warning them that an escalation in incidents targeting Jewish students would have corporate hiring consequences. The letter said "We look to you to ensure your students who hope to join our firms after graduation are prepared to be an active part of workplace communities that have zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment, much less the kind that has been taking place on some law school campuses."

Gordon Cooney Jr., whose execution was stayed in 1999 based on forensic evidence which had been "deliberately hidden" by a former assistant prosecutor; Thompson was finally freed in 2003. A book based on Thompson's legal misfortunes, *Killing Time: An 18-year Odyssey from Death Row to Freedom*, by John Hollway and Ronald M. Gauthier, was optioned for a film by Touchstone Pictures in 2009. Attorneys Christina K. Harper and George Cumming waged a successful 11-year pro bono legal battle to gain freedom for Kelly Savage, whose sentence for a 1995 murder conviction was commuted in 2017 by California Governor Jerry Brown.

Represented pro bono by Morgan Lewis & Bockius, with Lambda Legal and Immigration Equality; in October 2020, the United States Department of State withdrew its appeal of the verdict in *Kiviti v. Pompeo*, and declined to appeal *Mize-Gregg v. Pompeo*. Federal district courts ruled the State Department's refusal to recognize children born oversees to married same-sex, American citizen couples as U.S. citizens to be unlawful in both cases. Morgan Lewis partner Susan Baker Manning argued both cases, successfully challenging the State Department's policy of denying children born outside of the U.S. to some American same-sex, married couples birthright citizenship.
