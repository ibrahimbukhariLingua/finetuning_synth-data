# Cassa di Risparmio della Marca Trivigiana



**Cassa di Risparmio della Marca Trivigiana**, also known as **Cassamarca** in short, was an Italian savings bank headquartered in Treviso, Veneto. The history of the bank goes back to 1496 when the charitable institution **Monte di Pietà di Treviso** was founded. The savings bank was established by the *Monte* in 1907, following a first bank spinoff in 1822 that ended up being absorbed in 1872 by the Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde.

In 1992, following the Legge Amato [it], the bank was split into two organizations: a commercial bank, Cassamarca S.p.A., and the non-profit Fondazione Cassamarca – Cassa di Risparmio della Marca Trivigiana. In 1994, Cassamarca merged with the larger Cassa di Risparmio di Verona, Vicenza, Belluno e Ancona to form Unicredito, which in turn merged in 1998 with Credito Italiano to form UniCredit. The banking entity was fully absorbed into UniCredit in 2002; the foundation survived as a charitable organization (as of 2017), and still owned a 0.23 percent stake in UniCredit as of 31 December 2016.
