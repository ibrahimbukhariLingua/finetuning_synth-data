# Oppenheim family



The **Oppenheim family** is a German Jewish banking family which founded what was Europe's biggest private bank, Sal. Oppenheim.


## History of the family and raising to nobility

Salomon Oppenheim founded the banking firm Sal. Oppenheim in the late 18th century. Until its sale in 2009, Sal. Oppenheim was the largest privately owned investment/banking house in Europe, with assets of â‚¬348 billion.

The Oppenheim family also co-founded the German Colonia-Versicherung and sold their majority stake for 3 billion DM in 1989. 820 million DM were used to increase the equity of the bank, while the rest (over 2 billion DM) was paid out to the family.

In 1867, the family received nobility in Austria with the title of Baron and a year later, in 1868 they were admitted to nobility of Prussia, also with the title of Freiherr.
