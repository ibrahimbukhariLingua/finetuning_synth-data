## Abuse of the naira

Abuse of the naira refers to the mistreatment of, mishandling of, or disrespect towards the Nigerian currency, the naira. This can include actions such as:

* Defacing or mutilating banknotes or coins.
* Spraying or staining naira notes at parties or events.
* Using naira notes for non-financial purposes, such as for decoration, gifts, or as a medium for art.
* Damaging or destroying naira notes or coins intentionally.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) considers abuse of the naira a serious offense, as it can lead to a shortage of currency in circulation, increased costs for printing and replacing damaged notes, and a loss of confidence in the currency.

The CBN has implemented measures to prevent the abuse of the naira, including:

* Educating the public on the importance of handling the naira with care.
* Implementing penalties for those found guilty of abusing the naira.
* Encouraging the use of alternative payment methods, such as digital payments, to reduce the handling of physical cash.

In April 2024, a prominent Nigerian cross-dresser, Bobrisky, was arrested for defacing naira banknotes. The arrest was made by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) after an investigation into social media videos that appeared to show Bobrisky throwing money in the air at a film premiere the previous month. Bobrisky entered a guilty plea to four counts of currency abuse on April 5, 2024, and was sentenced to six months in prison with no option of fine on April 12, 2024.

In late 2024, the CBN fined banks for releasing new notes to hawkersᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ in an effort to clamp down on currency abuse.
