## History

Vitacost began operations in 1994 as a catalog retailer of third-party vitamins and supplements under the name Nature's Wealth Company by its founder Wayne Gorsek.

In 1999, the company launched Vitacost.com and introduced proprietary vitamins and supplements, which has since expanded to include food, beauty products and sports nutrition.

The company completed construction of a manufacturing facility located in Lexington, North Carolina, in 2008. Effective September 1, 2012, Vitacost agreed to lease its manufacturing facilities to a third-party provider.

On September 23, 2009, Vitacost went public.

Vitacost shares traded on the NASDAQ were suspended on December 7, 2010, for financials not adding up. By the time the stock was reinstated by NASDAQ, the stock had lost most of its value with investors losing almost all of their investment. ("Gebben").

During 2010, the company expanded and upgraded its West Coast distribution facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company began a similar project for its east coast distribution center, located in Lexington, North Carolina in the spring of 2010, with the building construction completed in the first quarter of 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
