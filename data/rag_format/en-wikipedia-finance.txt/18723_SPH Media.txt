**SPH Media Trust** (**SMT**), trading as **SPH Media**, is a mass media company in Singapore. It was incorporated on July 19, 2021, as a company limited by guarantee, it was a spin off from Singapore Press Holdings as part of a restructuring. It owns several major newspapers in the country, including the English-language *The Straits Times and The Business Times,* Chinese-language *Lianhe Zaobao* and *Shin Min Daily News*, Malay-language *Berita Harian,* and *the Tamil Murasu*. The company also publishes magazines and operates five radio stations.

It forms part of a duopoly of the mass media in the country, alongside the state-owned enterprise Mediacorp. SPH Media has over 2,500 employees, including a team of approximately 1,000 journalists, including correspondents operating around the world.


## History

Singapore Press Holdings Limited (SPH) was formed on August 4, 1984, through a merger of three organisations, The Straits Times Press Group, Singapore News and Publications Limited and Times Publishing Berhad.

SPH readership has stagnated since the early-2000s, as Singaporeans increasingly turned to online media for their news consumption.

On May 6, 2021, SPH in response to shareholder pressures, had proposed that it would restructure itself and transfer its media business into a company limited by guarantee (CLG), which will be privately managed. The new company would initially be managed by the holders of SPH's management shareholders at the time, while still having to issue new management shares of the media business under the CLG as required by Newspaper and Printing Presses Act. The government would also lift the shareholder limits on the currently listed SPH entity. This new CLG was named SPH Media Trust.

On September 10, 2021, an extraordinary general meeting was convened over the restructuring proposal to transfer all media business-related assets and staff to SMT. Approximately 97.55% of the 300 shareholders voted in favour of the proposal. The transfer was completed on 1 December 2021. The assets transferred included its headquarters, News Center, and its press, Print Center, as well as all intellectual property and information technology assets. Along with the assets transfer, 2,500 staff were transferred to SMT as well. SPH had also injected SMT with S$80 million cash and S$30 million of SPH stocks and SPH REIT units.

As part of its restructuring, it discontinued the print publication of *The New Paper* on December 11, 2021, becoming a digital-only publication. It also merged the *Lianhe Wanbao* (联合晚报) into the *Shin Min Daily News* (新明日报) on 24 December 2021, citing the limited number of Chinese media talent in the country, redundancy in content, and a plan to focus on bolstering its digital operations.

To aid with the restructuring of its operations, the Singapore government announced on February 16, 2022, that it would provide SMT up to S$900 million over the next five years, with the amount dependent on achieving certain targets such as reach and engagement of its products and to certain vernacular groups and youth.

A review of internal processes of SMT was started in March 2022 which included the reporting of circulation data. In January 2023, it was reported that daily circulation numbers of SPH's publications, including broadsheets *The Straits Times* and *Lianhe Zaobao*, were inflated by 10 to 12 percent. The figures were inflated due to double counting of subscriptions, a project account which was funded to purchase fictitious circulation and arbitrarily derived circulation numbers.


## Ownership

As a private company, SPH Media Trust is managed privately by its shareholders. The initial shareholders were made up of the management shareholders of Singapore Press Holdings, as SPH was a newspaper company as defined under the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) of 1974.
