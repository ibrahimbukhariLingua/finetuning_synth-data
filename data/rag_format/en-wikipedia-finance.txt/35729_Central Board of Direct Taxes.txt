The **Central Board of Direct Taxes** (**CBDT**) is a statutory body under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India. It oversees the administration of direct taxes, including income tax and corporate tax, through the Income Tax Department.

## History

The Central Board of Revenue, the apex body of the Department entrusted with the administration of taxes, was established under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1924. It was initially responsible for both direct and indirect taxes. However, on 1 January 1964, the Board was bifurcated into two separate entities: the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC). This division was formalized through the constitution of the two Boards under Section 3 of the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963.
