## History

Formed in 1979 as British Electricity International, it was the international arm of the UK's electricity supply industry, exporting technical and commercial expertise worldwide. Following the privatisation of the electricity industry, ownership passed later on, to a successor company, National Power at that time; from 1996 (renamed as British Power International) it became part of Eastern Group, one of the UK's leading power companies.

In 1999 it became an independent consultancy practice (British Power International Limited).

In 2008 Spice plc acquired British Power International ltd. In September 2011 Spice Limited rebranded as EnServe Group.
