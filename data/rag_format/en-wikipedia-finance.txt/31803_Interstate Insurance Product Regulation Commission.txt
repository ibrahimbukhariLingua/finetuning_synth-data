Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission


# Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission



The **Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission** is an organization that promotes standards for life insurance products in the United States. It approves or disapproves individual and group products such as annuity, life insurance, disability income, and long-term care policies. States must agree to the compact by legislation and its rules are subject to judicial review.


## History

The commission was created in 2002 by members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Its mission statement is to "serve[] insurance regulators, consumers and providers by improving the efficiency and effectiveness in the ever-changing insurance marketplace." It serves as a clearinghouse for insurance companies' policy form filings.

Following its creation, forty-five states joined the compact, the final one being Delaware in 2021. South Carolina withdrew in 2022 following a dispute with the Commission over its authority to approve long-term care rate increases.

The commission's authority was called into question in 2020 following the decision of ''Amica Life Insurance Company v Wertz'', in which the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that a standard 2-year suicide exclusion for life insurance contracts conflicted with state law and was an unauthorized delegation of authority to the commission.
