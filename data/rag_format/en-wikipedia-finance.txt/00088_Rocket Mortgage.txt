Rocket Mortgage


# Rocket Mortgage



**Rocket Mortgage, LLC**, formerly **Quicken Loans, LLC**, is an American mortgage lender, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. Rocket Mortgage uses wholesale funding for loans and online applications as opposed to a branch system.


## History


### 1985-1998; Early history

**Rock Financial** was founded as a mortgage broker in 1985 by Dan Gilbert, Ron Berman, Lindsay Gross, and Gary Gilbert. The company became a mortgage lender in 1988, and in May 1998 became publicly traded, launching an IPO.

In the late 1990s, the company shifted from a traditional mortgage provider to an online-focused lender. Traditionally, the home mortgage business in America has been fragmented due to varying regulations in each state and locality. Gilbert challenged this orthodoxy, however, by offering loan applications online that were reviewed by experts versed in the regulations of each region but who were located in a central headquarters.
