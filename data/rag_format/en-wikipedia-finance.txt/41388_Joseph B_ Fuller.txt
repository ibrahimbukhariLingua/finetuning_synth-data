## Academia and commentaries

Fuller is a professor of management practice at the Harvard Business School. He serves as a member-at-large of the Harvard College Fund. He has authored business cases about Terrapin Laboratory, Loki Capital Management, DaVita Inc., MuMaté, Hövding, GenapSys, HourlyNerd, and Saudi Aramco. He has published research about dividend policy, income inequality and the skills gap.

With Michael C. Jensen, Fuller argued that dividend policy was critical to solving the politics of agency costs between shareholders and senior executives. As a result, they agreed with Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the SEC, that companies should give high dividends to their shareholders annually to make sure their investments were based on dynamic capital market returns and avoid wasting resources on unnecessary investments or extravagant compensations.

Fuller suggested that educators and employers would have to work together to address the skills gap. With his colleagues Jan W. Rivkin and Karen Mills, Fuller argued that fostering shared prosperity would entail the collective impact of leaders in "government, business, education, nonprofits, labor, philanthropy" and other sectors.

With Matthew Sigelman, Fuller argued that the Trans-Pacific Partnership could not explain high unemployment rates and low wages in the United States; instead, globalization led to a skills gap and the US workforce needed to be retrained to fill new highly skilled jobs. Taking the example of J.P. Morgan, which announced they would train their employees to make sure they could be promoted, Fuller and Sigelman encouraged US companies to do the same, adding that such an investment would foster soft skills.

In the wake of Donald Trump's victory, Fuller argued the skills gap would have to be tackled. To do this, Fuller suggested the United States Department of Education should broaden the scope of Pell Grants to enable non-traditional college students in programs co-sponsored by a company to qualify; make it mandatory for colleges to disclose their graduation rates; encourage apprenticeships; review accreditation standards.
