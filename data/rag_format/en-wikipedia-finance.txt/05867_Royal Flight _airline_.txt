# Royal Flight (airline)



Joint stock company **Royal Flight Airlines** (Russian: АО «Авиакомпания «Роял Флайт»), formerly **Abakan-Avia** (Russian: ЗАО «Авиакомпания «Абакан-Авиа»), was a charter airline based in Abakan, Republic of Khakassia, Russia. It operated charter services between Russian cities and various holiday destinations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean. Its main base was the Abakan Airport (ABA).


## History

The airline was established in 1992 as **Abakan-Avia** and started operations in 1993. It was established from a former Aeroflot unit, and started domestic cargo flights in 1993 and international flights in 1994. Sobol acquired a 70% share in 1999. It had 76 employees (at March 2007). In 2002, a proposed merger with RusAir failed. In July 2014, it was purchased by Russian tour operator Coral Travel and renamed Royal Flight Airlines on 11 July 2014.

In May 2022, Royal Flight ceased all operations.
