## Activities

INJAZ Al-Arab's programs focus on four core areas of business education which are:

* **Work Readiness**: The widespread mismatch between the skills attained in school and those demanded by the private sector are feeding current youth unemployment rates. INJAZ Al-Arab programs build teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and leadership skills employers look for.
* **Financial Literacy**: Teaching young people about responsible money management is key to building their own financial security and an economically prosperous future for themselves.
* **Entrepreneurship**: Entrepreneurship education prepares youth to be responsible, enterprising individuals. Immersing them in real-life learning experiences allows them to take measured risks, manage the results, and learn from the outcomes. This growing number of youth-led enterprises creates new jobs and fuels economic development.

* **STEM & Technology**: programs that aim to equip young individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in a technology-driven world.
