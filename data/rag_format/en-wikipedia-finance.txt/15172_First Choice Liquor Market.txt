First Choice Liquor Market


# First Choice Liquor Market



**First Choice Liquor Market** is a group of liquor superstores in Australia owned by Coles Group, and competes principally with the Endeavour Group-owned Dan Murphy's chain as a big-box retailer in the takeaway liquor market.


## History

First Choice Liquor grew out of the former Quaffers brand, and sits alongside Liquorland and Vintage Cellars, Coles' other liquor brands. The first store was opened in May 2005 at Tooronga Village in Melbourne. Expansion of the chain was assisted with Coles Group purchasing the Queensland-based Hedley Hotel chain and Mr Corks Liquor Group in 2006. The chain comprised 93 stores as of May 2018.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ

An ultra-discount no-frills banner of Wesfarmers, called Liquor Market (with a 'yellow water/beer drop' logo) had experimented with about half a dozen stores in Melbourne from October 2016, then Sydney. However, the brand name failed to gain major traction, thus, they have been merged '1st Choice Liquor Market' since 2019 after Coles Group was spun out from Wesfarmers, with many 'First Choice' stores switching from their traditional blue theme and signage to the yellow colouring.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

As at June 2018 there were 98 First Choice Market stores.

First Choice Liquor Market expanded into Tasmania in February 2024. In September 2024, Coles announced it would begin a pilot program to rebrand some First Choice Liquor stores as Liqourland.
