# Godrej family



The **Godrej family** is an Indian Gujarati Parsi family that largely owns and manages the Godrej Group, a conglomerate founded by Ardeshir Godrej and his brother Pirojsha Burjorji Godrej in 1897. The family operates in various sectors, including real estate, consumer products, industrial engineering, appliances, furniture, security, and agricultural products. The family is led by Adi Godrej, along with his brother Nadir Godrej and their cousin Jamshyd Godrej. As of 2023, their estimated net worth was reported to be US$16.7 billion.


## History

The family's business began in Bombay in 1897, when Ardeshir Godrej, after reading a newspaper article about rising crime rates in the city, began developing and selling locks with the assistance of his brother Pirojsha. Ardeshir Godrej died without direct heirs, and the business was succeeded by Pirojsha Godrej's sons Burjor, Sohrab, and Naval. Today, his grandsons Adi, Nadir, and Jamshyd manage the enterprise.

The initial venture has diversified across sectors and evolved into multiple companies under the umbrella of the Godrej Group, including Godrej Industries, Godrej Agrovet, Godrej Consumer Products, Godrej Properties, Godrej Interio, and the holding company Godrej & Boyce.


## Estate in Mumbai

Among the family's most valuable assets is a 3,500-acre estate in Vikhroli, Mumbai, which has been estimated at $12 billion upon development. In 2011, the family announced plans to develop three million square feet by 2017, through an internal joint venture of Godrej Industries and Godrej Properties. For decades, the family has preserved approximately 1,750 acres of mangrove swamps within the estate, leading to the 2012 inclusion of Adi Godrej and Jamshyd Godrej in Forbes magazine's list of the richest green billionaires. On 18 June 2014, the Godrej family bought the bungalow of Homi J. Bhabha, *Mehrangir*, for Rs. 372 Cr through an auction initiated by the National Center for the Performing Arts in Mumbai.
