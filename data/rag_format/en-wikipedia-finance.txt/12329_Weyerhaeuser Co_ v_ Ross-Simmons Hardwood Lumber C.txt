Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co.


# Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co.



***Weyerhaeuser Company v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company***, 549 U.S. 312 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case related to antitrust regulations.


## Background

Both parties operated sawmills; Ross-Simmons was driven out of business by what it complained was Weyerhaeuser's attempted monopsonization of the market. The theory was "predatory buying": a purchaser buys so much of a given raw material that it drives up the price and thereby excludes less pecunious rivals who depend on the same raw material.


## Opinion of the Court

The Supreme Court rejected the theory on a rule of reason analysis, noting that there are any number of legitimate business strategies that involve buying large quantities of raw materials. A plaintiff alleging predatory buying must therefore prove—and Ross-Simmons had not—that the defendant caused the price to rise, *and* that the defendant is likely to recoup the costs incurred in such a scheme.

The Court's decision symmetrized its case law, with *Weyerhaeuser* and *Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.* applying identical standards to predatory buying and predatory selling claims respectively.
