The corporation was established on 1 May 1946 by the Nationalist government after the handover of Taiwan from Japan to Republican China, by merging all of the sugar companies (Dai-Nihon, Taiwan, Meiji, and Ensuiko Sugar Company) during the Japanese era in Taiwan. In the 1950s and 1960s, sugar was one of the major exports of Taiwan; the corporation remains a major land owner today.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
