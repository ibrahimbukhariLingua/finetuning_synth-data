## History

The Bank of New Zealand was formed as a private company and incorporated by the New Zealand Bank Act 1861, which created the company and authorises it to issue banknotes. The Bank of New Zealand's first office opened in Auckland in October 1861, followed shortly afterwards by the first branch in Dunedin in December 1861.

In 1862, branches opened in Wellington, Christchurch, and London. The bank gained the banking account of the New Zealand Government from the Union Bank of Australia, and became an agent to raise debt in the United Kingdom for the government.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In the 1860s and 1870s capital was brought into New Zealand by the government and others. There was plenty of employment, development moved quickly and very good prospects brought property prices to high values.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In the 1880s prices of staple products fell very low, the rabbit pest cut wool production, and the government cut expenditure on public works by 75 per cent. Land fell to half its former value and was impossible to realise, many runholders and businessmen were ruined and the working classes were unable to purchase goods or pay their debts. There was no dairying or frozen meat industry. Investors withdrew their capital. The export of frozen meat began in the 1880s refer Canterbury Lamb and dairy products soon followed see Anchor butter.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In June 1894 the BNZ saved by legislation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 1895, the BNZ took over the Colonial Bank of New Zealand, which was in crisis.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Sustainability

Bank of New Zealand became the first bank in New Zealand to become carbon neutral. The achievement was announced in September 2010 after a three-year initiative to reduce emissions through greater energy and vehicle efficiency, encouraging changed behaviour by employees at work and at home and through offsetting of unavoidable emissions by purchasing quality carbon credits. The most visible aspect of the initiative came through the construction of three brand new, energy efficient buildings to house the bulk of the company’s management and administration staff. Two of these building are located in the Auckland CBD, one at Quay Park and the other at 80 Queen Street. The third was the Harbour Quays complex on the Wellington waterfront, built in 2009 and demolished in 2019 after suffering damage in the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake. The Deloitte Centre at 80 Queen Street was tagged "the greenest building in the land" after it became the first building in New Zealand to receive three Five Green Stars awards. The BNZ Quay Park building was nominated for a BeST Design Award in 2008 for Offices and Workplace Environments.
