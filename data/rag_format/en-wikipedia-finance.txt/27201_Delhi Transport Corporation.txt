Delhi Transport Corporation


# Delhi Transport Corporation



The **Delhi Transport Corporation** **(DTC)** is a public sector passenger road transport corporation that manages bus services in Delhi, India. It was incorporated in November 1971 as a wholly-owned corporation of the Government of India to provide an efficient, economical and properly coordinated road transport service in Delhi. Its administrative control was transferred to the Department of Transport, Government of Delhi with effect from 5 August 1996.

As of November 2023, DTC is the largest CNG-powered bus service operator in the world, and also has the largest number of electric buses in India. It operates from 37 depots and three Interstate Bus Terminals in Delhi: Kashmere Gate ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT, and Sarai Kale Khan ISBT.


## History

The Ministry of Transport, Government of India, took over local bus services in Delhi in May 1948 when the services offered by the incumbent service provider Gwalior and Northern India Transport Company Ltd. was found to be insufficient for the growing demand. For this purpose, a Delhi Road Transport Authority was constituted under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950. This authority became an undertaking of Municipal Corporation of Delhi by an Act of Parliament in April 1958.

In 1971, on the recommendations of a working group of the Planning Commission, which concluded that Delhi Transport as an extension of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had not been functioning efficiently and adequately that was leading to leakage of revenue and very high operational costs, the Government of India took over management of the undertaking by passing the Delhi Road Transport Laws (Amendment) Act. The newly constituted Delhi Transport Corporation took over assets and liabilities from the DTU up until 2 November 1971.

The administrative control of DTC was transferred to the Department of Transport, Government of Delhi, with effect from 5 August 1996 after writing off all the Union government loans along with the interest accrued on them (amounting to ₹2,123 crore (US$250 million)).


## Overview

The objectives of the Delhi Transport Corporation are defined under Section 18 of the Delhi Road Transport Laws (Amendment) Act, 1971, in conjunction with Section 22 of the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950. These objectives encompass the following responsibilities:

* To provide an efficient, economical, reliable and properly coordinated system of road transport in Delhi and any extended area (while acting on business principles).
* To achieve a high level operational efficiency.
* To charge fares not exceeding those prescribed by the State Under Section 43(1)(i) of the Motor Vehicles Act.
* To attain financial self-sufficiency.

### Organizational Structure

The management of the Delhi Transport Corporation is overseen by a Board of Directors, which includes the Chairman-cum-Managing Director (CMD) and other directors appointed by the Government of Delhi. The CMD, serving as the organization's Chief Executive, is responsible for managing day-to-day operations. This role is supported by a team comprising four Chief General Managers, six Regional Managers, and Depot Managers.


## Services

DTC has an extensive network of bus routes spread all over Delhi. A few routes traverse the neighbouring cities of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. As of June 2023, of the 606 total bus routes in Delhi, 259 were operated by DTC, 209 were operated by DIMTS, and 138 routes were operated on by both the authorities under the Department of Transport's 'Unified Time Table'. These routes are serviced by 7,135 buses, with 4,088 of them under DTC, out of 37 depots and 3 ISBTs. The average number of trips in FY 2021-22 was 31,084 per day. The number of routes being operated by the corporation has been steadily falling over the years under the Delhi government's policy of a 50:50 ratio of DTC buses and cluster buses on every route.

DTC also provides various other provisions like night services, tourist services, and airport express services. It also provides buses to Delhi Police and used to do so for some schools (however, this was stopped in July 2022).


### Inter-state bus services

Until 2010, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) operated interstate bus services to cities in North India. These services were discontinued after the fleet transitioned to CNG, a fuel that was not widely available in other states at the time. As of 2023, the Delhi government plans to relaunch interstate services with a fleet of 1,600 premium buses connecting major cities like Dehradun, Jaipur, Shimla, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Jammu, and Agra with Delhi. Under this plan, DTC will manage the services in collaboration with selected private operators. The fleet will include 1,200 electric buses designed for routes up to 200 kilometers (120 miles) and 400 BS-VI CNG buses for longer distances.


## Fleet

As of September 2023, DTC has a fleet of 4,088 buses, with 3,288 CNG buses and 800 electric buses. This makes its fleet the largest CNG bus fleet in the world, and the largest electric bus fleet in India. The buses are dispatched from 37 bus depots across Delhi. With Delhi's total bus fleet numbering 7,135, 57% of these are operated by the DTC.

DTC has witnessed two major fleet improvements in its history. The first significant overhaul to its fleet happened in anticipation of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, when DTC received 3,125 new CNG low-floor buses (2500 first, followed by 625), which increased its fleet size to a high of 6,204 buses. This marked the first time DTC acquired low-floor buses, and since then, all subsequent orders have exclusively been for this type of bus. The new buses consisted of air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned Tata-Marcopolo low-floor Starbuses and Ashok Leyland ultra-low-floor (ULF) buses. The air-conditioned buses were painted red, while the non-air-conditioned ones were painted green, making them easily distinguishable. These new buses have features such as automatic transmission, power steering, ramps for disabled people, and stop-request buttons located on grab bars. With the introduction of these buses, Delhi's fleet of 2,400 privately owned "killer" Blueline buses was gradually phased out. In 2011, DTC planned to make use of biogas generated from sewage treatment plants to run its buses.

The second major upgrade to DTC's fleet began in 2021 when the Delhi government decided to exclusively procure electric buses going forward. Subsequently, with deliveries in multiple batches, DTC's fleet of electric buses has grown to 800, making it the largest e-bus fleet in India. The new buses feature digital ticketing, GPS, CCTV, and panic buttons, all connected to a two-way centralised command and control center at Kashmere Gate. The Delhi government has plans to provide a total of 1,800 new electric buses to DTC by the end of 2023.


## Depots

DTC manages its operations from 37 bus depots, which are organised into four regions: East, North, South, and West. 36 of these depots are located in Delhi, with 1 located in the neighbouring city of Noida. These facilities handle regular maintenance and cleaning of buses. To complement DTC's existing depots, the Delhi government is constructing 9 additional bus depots at Kirari, East Vinod Nagar 2, Narela, Daurala, Burari, Savda Ghevra, Kapashera, Gadaipur, and Chattarpur.

## Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS)

The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is a transport consultancy and infrastructure development firm. It operates as a joint venture, with equal equity shared between the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the IDFC Foundation, a not-for-profit initiative of the Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited.

The DIMTS operates a fleet of 1,725 buses under the cluster scheme, categorised by their colour: orange for non-air-conditioned buses and blue for air-conditioned ones. These buses are equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, which enable real-time tracking of their movement and geographic location through the Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system. This system provides Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) and other relevant data to passengers via the PoochhO App. The Poocho App also includes a trip planner, real-time information on pollution levels in the vicinity, and several other features designed to enhance the travel experience for passengers.

Electronic Ticketing Machines (ETMs) are used on DIMTS buses as part of the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system, replacing pre-printed tickets. Since August 2018, passengers can also use DMRC Metro Cards to purchase tickets on these buses, providing seamless integration with the Delhi Metro system.

Under the cluster scheme, private concessionaires are responsible for supplying the buses, ensuring their cleaning and maintenance, and providing staff. In return, they are compensated based on an indexed cost system. This system includes:

* A **fixed component** tied to the cost of the bus,
* A **variable component** covering fuel and maintenance costs, and
* A **wage-related component** adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index.

This model ensures fair compensation while maintaining cost efficiency and service quality.
