## History of CIFIT

CIFIT started out as the Fujian Fair for International Investment & Trade (FFIIT). It was held for the ten years between 1987 and 1996. Then came the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) of the People's Republic of China who saw the opportunity to expand this trade show to include marketing the rest of China for foreign direct investment. Consequently, the FFIIT was promoted officially to CIFIT in January 1997.
