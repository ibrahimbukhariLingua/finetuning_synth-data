Grupo Cartes


# Grupo Cartes



**Grupo Cartes** was a business conglomerate owned by Paraguay's ex-president Horacio Cartes. It included the cigarette company Tabacalera del Este (Tabesa), as well as beverage, banking, agricultural, transportation and trading interests. The group said it employed about 3,500 people as of 2013.

In 2023, U.S. ambassador to Paraguay Marc Ostfield announced that the Office of Foreign Assets Control banned doing financial operations in American dollars of any kind to Horacio Cartes and his enterprise. This came after an investigation concluded that he actively participated in corruption actions before, during and after his period as president of Paraguay. Later, both Horacio Cartes and his sister Sarah announced that they were leaving and divesting from the conglomerate and that the Grupo Cartes's brand and structure would be changed, effective 24 March 2023. Cartes passed shares in the businesses to his legal heirs as an advance on their inheritance, with each new company group(s) operating autonomously.


## History

According to the company's website, in October 1990 Cartes created the Livestock Sophia SA. The Tabesa cigarette company's website, states that he was one of the founders in 1994 of the cigarette company at Hernandarias, Alto Paraná along with Horacio Cartes, Jose Angel Avalos, Marcelino Zarate Riquelme, Pedro Knight and Cesar Cabral. The company is said to employ 1,150 as of 2013 and to have taken half the marketplace from Marlboro which previously dominated.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Cartes Group opened Bebidas USA to sell products under the name of "Planet Pulp" in the U.S.

In June 2012 Banco Amambay had around 2.8% of Paraguay's deposits (the 13th-largest by loan size), with its top 20 depositors accounting for 61% of its deposits.

Grupo Cartes had two joint ventures with Chilean Quiñenco; Bebidas del Paraguay through Compañía de las Cervecerías Unidas and Enex Paraguay through Enex. Following United States labelling of Horacio Cartes as "significantly corrupt", Quiñenco executives including Andrónico Luksic and Rodrigo Hinzpeter made a controversial visit in a private jet to the Cartes mansion to negotiate an end to the joint ventures.
