Euronics


# Euronics



**Euronics International Ltd.** is an international association of over 11,000 independent electrical retailers in 37 countries. It functions as a leading international electrical retail group on behalf of its members, and is based in Amsterdam. It operates as a European Economic Interest Grouping entity (an EEIG) meaning that all stores are independent sellers.


## History

Euronics International was founded in 1990 by five national groups from Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. The groups realized at the time that they had to react to the structural changes brought about by globalization to remain competitive. At the same time they would preserve the advantages of specialising in the trade of mainly electronics by maintaining qualified employees, specialist knowledge and personal customer service.

The five groups formed an EEIG in order to have the flexibility of having separate businesses, as well as each business having local knowledge of their area, but the buying power and branding involved with having a single entity.
