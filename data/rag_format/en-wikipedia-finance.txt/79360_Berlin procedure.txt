Berlin procedure


# Berlin procedure



The **Berlin procedure** (**BV**) is a mathematical procedure for time series decomposition and seasonal adjustment of monthly and quarterly economic time series. The mathematical foundations of the procedure were developed in 1960's at Technische Universit√§t Berlin and the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). The most important user of the procedure is the Federal Statistical Office of Germany.

For the latest version 4.1 of BV a BV4.1 software is available as freeware for non-commercial purposes.


## Specific features of the procedure

The latest version 4.1 of the Berlin procedure is distinguished from other commonly used decomposition and seasonal adjustment methods (i.e. X-12-ARIMA) by the following characteristic features:

* The procedure works well even with time series showing strongly changing seasonal patterns.
* Trend-cycles are depicted plausibly in terms of economic points of view.
* The cost-benefit ratio is low as the user does not need special training or even expert knowledge or long-term experience with the procedure to make high-quality analyses.
* On principle the analysis results do not depend on the respective user since there is no need to determine any series-specific parameters of the procedure.
* As linear regression models are used, on principle there are no differences between indirect and direct analysis results of aggregate series.
