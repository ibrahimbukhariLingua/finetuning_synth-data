# SCOR SE



**SCOR SE** is a French tier 1 reinsurance company providing Property and Casualty (P&C) and Life reinsurance solutions to its clients. It is one of the leading reinsurers in the world. Created in 1970 with the backing of the French government, its original name was *Société Commerciale de Réassurance*, hence "SCOR". The SE acronym indicates that the company is a *Societas Europaea* (European company). In 2007, it became the first French listed company to use the SE acronym in its name.
