Oxford Global Islamic Branding and Marketing Forum


# Oxford Global Islamic Branding and Marketing Forum



The **Oxford Global Islamic Branding and Marketing Forum** is a two-day forum that brings together over 250 business leaders, branding and marketing experts and thought leaders to discuss and understand the key issues that face the growth of the Muslim market.


## About the Forum

According to the Pew Research Center a comprehensive demographic study (Mapping the Global Muslim Population) of more than 200 countries finds that there are 1.57 billion Muslims of all ages living in the world today, representing 23% of an estimated 2009 world population of 6.8 billion. Not only is the Muslim population a significant percentage of the global population but AT Kearney also point out that the market for sharia compliant products or services – that is products and services that confirm to Islamic Law – totals US$2trillion annually and is growing rapidly.

As Muslim countries develop, there is an expressed need to develop and market their own brands to the rest of the world. Additionally, there is massive interest amongst non-Muslim companies in how to enter and penetrate this global market, which spans many industries, including finance, food and beverage, cosmetics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, logistics, tourism, fashion, and others.

This Forum brings Muslim and non-Muslim leaders and companies from a variety of business sectors together to discuss how to develop better trade and business relations and to learn from each other about the markets involved and to facilitate greater understanding of each other. This is a new and growing area of marketing and branding that has not been fully understood but is gaining interest from the business world.

Islam is one religion, but within the Islamic global population there are many markets that behave differently from cultural and business perspectives and both Muslim and non-Muslim marketers seek to understand these differences effectively to address their needs.
