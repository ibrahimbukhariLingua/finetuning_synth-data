Rory Macnamara was the chairman, and Nick Basing the chief executive. The shares were traded on London's Alternative Investment Market, under the ticker ESS. The Company had loan notes which were freely transferable and were listed on PLUS Markets.

The company was taken private in 2015 by Harwood Capital, then returned to the market as Ten Entertainment Group in 2017.
