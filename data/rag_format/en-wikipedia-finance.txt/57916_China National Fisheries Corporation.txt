China National Fisheries Corporation


# China National Fisheries Corporation



The **China National Fisheries Corporation** (CNFC) is a Chinese state owned enterprise which operates fisheries related businesses.


## History

CNFC is the major Chinese operator in the distant water fisheries. It sent the first Chinese fishing fleet to West African waters when it sent thirteen trawlers to Guinea-Bissau in 1985. The fleet was seen off by a crowd of more than 1,000. The expansion into distant water fisheries followed a decline in China's coastal fisheries due to overexploitation. The following year, with other Chinese partners, CNFC started trawling operations in the North Pacific. Tuna longlining followed in the South Pacific, and in 1989, squid longlining in the Japan Sea and the North Pacific. CNFC has been a significant beneficiary of corporate subsidies from the Chinese government.

In 2016 CNFC had to bail out its listed arm CNFC Overseas Fishery Co. due to poor profitability.

In 2022 CNFC completed a four hundred million CNY fundraising round to recapitalize its tuna fleet.

A 2023 report by the Financial Transparency Coalition noted that five CNFC vessels had been accused of human rights abuses. The third most of any Chinese company.


## Facilities
