National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority


# National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority



The **National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA)** will, from April 2025, be an executive agency advising the UK Government on infrastructure delivery and improvement. It will combine the functions of the National Infrastructure Commission and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority.


## History

In May 2024, ahead of the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party announced plans to merge the National Infrastructure Commission with the Infrastructure and Projects Authority in order to speed up the delivery of major infrastructure projects in the UK.

In October 2024, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves convened the inaugural meeting of the British Infrastructure Taskforce, with representatives of major financial companies in attendance, to build business confidence in UK infrastructure investments and start development of a ten-year infrastructure strategy, to be supported by NISTA. In December 2024, HM Treasury started the process of recruiting NISTA's first chief executive, a Â£200,000-a-year role leading a team of around 240 civil servants and advising on "the improvement of quality, cost, schedule, performance and project outcomes".

In January 2025, it was confirmed that NISTA would be established in April 2025 and would be a joint unit of HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office, with Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones as the responsible minister, and Treasury permanent secretary James Bowler as principal accounting officer.
