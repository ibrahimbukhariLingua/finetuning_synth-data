## History

It was started in 1860 and later developed by Karl Schweri. It later made Switzerland's first discounter in 1967 in Zürich. In 1973, it broke the country's tobacco cartel. In 2004, the sales of its 580 outlets exceeded CHF 1.8 billion.

In 2005 Denner acquired its rival discount chain Pick Pay.

In January 2007, it was announced that Migros has purchased a majority stake in Denner. After the entrance of the worldwide-known retailers Aldi and Lidl (2004 and 2009), Denner successfully defended its leading role in the discount category.

"One for all" ("Einer für Alle") is the company claim, as it describes itself as the "Retail's Robin Hood", who is fighting for cheaper prices for the customers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
