In the same year, Stockland's activities became more diversified, moving into commercial development, initially with retail projects in suburbs of Sydney. In 1965 Stockland opened its first big commercial development - the redeveloped Imperial Arcade, Sydney in Sydney's CBD, which offered the first underground link to David Jones, four retail levels and six levels of office space.

Its current activities include:
