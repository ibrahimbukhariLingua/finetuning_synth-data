## History

The company was founded in 1869 after the purchase by Thomas H. Handy of the Sazerac Coffee House, a bar and importer of a brand of cognac named *Sazerac de Forge*. The coffee house itself had been established in 1850. After its purchase, Handy's company began to acquire and market more brands of liquor. According to the company, the Sazerac Coffee House had been named after a cocktail called the Sazerac that was created in the mid-1800s by the immigrant Antoine Amédée Peychaud, who operated a pharmacy on Royal Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans in 1838. The company publishes a Sazerac recipe and produces a Peychaud's Bitters named after Peychaud, which is an ingredient in the traditional Sazerac cocktail.
