Zurich Metropolitan Area


# Zurich Metropolitan Area



The **European Metropolitan Region of Zurich** (**EMRZ**), also **Greater Zurich Area** (**GZA**, German **Zürcher Wirtschaftsraum, Metropolregion Zürich**), the metropolitan area surrounding Zurich, is one of Europe’s economically strongest areas and Switzerland’s economic centre.
It comprises the area that can be reached within a roughly 80-minute drive from Zurich Airport. Home to many international companies, it includes most of the canton of Zurich, and stretches as far as the Aargau and Solothurn in the west, Thurgau, St. Gallen and parts of Grisons in the east, Schaffhausen in the north and Zug and parts of Schwyz and Glarus in the south.

The Swiss federal office for statistics defines an unofficial metropolitan area as including all areas where more than 1/12 of the workforce commutes to the core area.
According to the 2000 Swiss census, this includes a total of 220 municipalities in seven cantons: 127 in the canton of Zürich, 58 in Aargau, 11 in Schwyz, 10 in Zug, 9 in Schaffhausen, 3 in Thurgau and 2 in St. Gallen.

Numerous Swiss and international corporations are based in the area, profiting from benefits such as

* the low tax rate
* the low cost of doing business, excellent infrastructure
* the high quality of life
* the dominant financial sector Zürich
