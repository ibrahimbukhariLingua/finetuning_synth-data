# Pierre Lemieux (economist)



**Pierre Lemieux** is a Canadian economist whose writings straddle economic and political theory, public choice, public finance, and public policy. He lives in Maine.


## Early life and education

Lemieux was born in Sherbrooke, Quebec in 1947. He earned a Master of Arts in Economics from the University of Toronto and another in Philosophy from the Université de Sherbrooke.


## Career

Lemieux is a professor in the Department of Management Sciences at the University of Québec in Outaouais. He is also currently a senior fellow at the Montreal Economic Institute. During the winter of 2009, he was a visiting scholar in the Department of Economics at San Jose State University. Lemieux is also a senior affiliated scholar at the Mercatus Center, a non-profit think tank associated with George Mason University.

He has been a columnist for the Western Standard and has published pieces in several financial newspapers, including *The Wall Street Journal*, *The National Post*, the *Le Figaro Économie*, and *La Tribune*.

Lemieux is the founder of the *Iconoclastes* book series published by Les Belles Lettres.

He has also been an occasional consultant for a few national and international corporations. He is a frequent contributor to *Regulation, Econlib.org, The Hill,* and *The Maine Wire.*


## Scholarship

His first books, published in Paris in the 1980s, were on the economics and political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism and classical liberalism: *Du libéralisme à l'anarcho capitalisme* (*From Liberalism to Anarcho-Capitalism*), *La souveraineté de l'individu* (*The Sovereignty of the Individual*), and *L'anarcho-capitalisme* (*Anarcho-Capitalism*).

He went on in the early 1990s to publish *Apologie des sorcières modernes* (*Apology of Modern Witches*), in defense of insider trading, and *Le droit de porter des armes* (*The Right to Keep and Bear Arms*), in defense of this right. In late 1990, he published, in Montréal, a little book, in both an English and French version, in favor of the liberty to smoke tobacco: *Smoking and Liberty: Government as a Public Health Problem*.

His 2008 book *Comprendre l'économie. Ou comment les économistes pensent* (*Understanding Economics: Or How Economists Think*), published by the Belles Lettres foundation in Paris, is an introduction to economics for the layman. The book was awarded a Turgot Prize by the Mises Institute.

In another book published by Les Belles Lettres (Paris) in 2009, *Une crise peut en cacher une autre*, Lemieux argued that the Financial crisis of 2007–08 was a consequence of mounting state intervention.

In 2013, he published *The Public Debt Problem: A Comprehensive Guide.*
