# Sandbox Industries



**Sandbox Industries** is a venture capital firm located in Chicago. The firm focuses on connecting established corporations with disruptive startups via strategic corporate investment funds.


## History

Sandbox was founded in Chicago in 2003 by Bob Shapiro and Nick Rosa.

At its outset, Sandbox ran a startup Foundry that employed entrepreneurs and tasked them with researching and testing the viability of a startup concept. These companies were provided with seed funding, mentorship, and office space in exchange for equity. Portfolio companies include Lab42, FeeFighters and Marbles: The Brain Store. The firm has since ceased the internal founding of its own startups to focus on connecting corporate partners with entrepreneurs outside its own walls.

Sandbox Industries also founded two new business accelerators, Healthbox and Excelerate.

Healthbox, founded in 2011 and a strategic partner of BCBSVP, began as a three-month startup accelerator program that provides seed capital, mentorship, office space, and advisors to healthcare-related companies. Healthbox also launched Healthbox Solutions, which expedited market entry for early-stage healthcare companies; the Healthbox Foundry, an evaluation and commercialization process designed to help organizations advance internal innovation; and Healthbox Collaborative Innovation Funds, which Healthbox developed alongside healthcare organizations to meet their individual needs. In November 2014, Healthbox announced a partnership with Intermountain Healthcare to work with its Intermountain Foundry, where hospital employees with entrepreneurial ideas can work to make them a reality.

Excelerate, founded in 2010 and based in Chicago, was a three-month startup accelerator program for tech-enabled startups. It has since become a part of the TechStars accelerator network as TechStars Chicago. Excelerate was named one of Tech Cocktail's Top 15 USA Startup Accelerators in 2012.
