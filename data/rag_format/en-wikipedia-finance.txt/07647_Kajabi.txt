## History

Kajabi was founded in Irvine, California in 2010 by Kenny Rueter, a software engineer who created a PVC sprinkler toy for his sons. The toy was popular, and after having difficulty trying to monetize a related how-to video on YouTube, Rueter started Kajabi. The company integrated various software that digital entrepreneurs needed to start online businesses.

In November 2019, the company took its first outside capital since its inception, a minority equity investment from Spectrum Equity Partners.

In 2021, Ahad Khan took over as CEO, and founder Rueter became executive chairman. In May 2021, the company raised a $550 million funding round at a $2 billion valuation, making it a tech unicorn. The funding round was led by Tiger Global, with participation from TPG Capital, Tidemark Capital, Owl Rock, Meritech Capital Partners, and Spectrum Equity. In July, the company added podcast hosting and marketing features for business owners. Also in 2021, the company was named to the Inc 5000 list of the fastest growing private companies in the United States for the 7th straight year. Also in 2021, the company launched a television advertising campaign "What Will You Create", created by Los Angeles-based production company Snow Beach.

In February 2022, former TikTok and Amazon executive Sean Solme Kim joined the company as president and chief product officer.
