Tower 185


# Tower 185



**Tower 185** is a 55-storey, 200 m (660 ft) skyscraper in the Gallus district of Frankfurt, Germany. As of 2023, it is the fourth-tallest building in Frankfurt and the fourth-tallest in Germany, tied with Main Tower. The anchor tenant of the tower is the German branch office of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has leased 60,000 m² (650,000 sq ft).

The tower was initially planned to be 185 m (607 ft) with 50 storeys; however, in the final plan by Christoph Mäckler, the height was increased to 200 m (660 ft). Nevertheless, its name was not changed, hence "Tower 185".

When Germany submitted its application to have Frankfurt selected as the seat of the European Union's Anti-money-laundering authority (AMLA) in 2023, Tower 185 was one of three options – alongside Messeturm – presented as potential location for the new agency.
