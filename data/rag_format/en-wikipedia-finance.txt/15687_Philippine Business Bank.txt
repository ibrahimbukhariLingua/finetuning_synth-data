## History

Philippine Business Bank started operations on February 12, 1997, as Total Savings Bank. Before the year ended, it obtained approval from the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to change its corporate name to the current one. To keep itself close to the small and medium scale businesses which includes both small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large companies which it seeks to serve, PBB operates from its head office in Caloocan unlike other banking institutions in the Philippines which hold office in the plush Makati or Ortigas business centers as favored by other banks.

Although considered a newcomer in the banking community, PBB established 10 branches in its first year. By the end of its second year, it had 15 branches in Metro Manila and neighboring business centers. The bank aims to branch out into the country's other business hubs. In January 2013, PBB announced plans to expand its nationwide network of 78 branches to 100 by year-end. The first phase of expansion will focus on Luzon, especially the Metro Manila area, and additional branches will be used to reach out to the Philippines’ growing SME industry, which accounts for 63 per cent of PBB's total loan portfolio.

In early 2013, PBB has announced an initial public offering (IPO) at the Philippine Stock Exchange in Manila to fund its nationwide expansion to 100 branches by the end of 2013. The IPO raised $98.8 million.

As of end of December 2013, PBB had a total of 100 branches across the country and received regulatory approval to open up 26 new branches in 2014 in various locations in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao as part of its purposes of expanding its network more closer to the SME market.

In 2013 former ambassador Alfredo Yao, the major shareholder of the bank, was awarded the Grand MVP Bossing title (an annual nationwide search for top Filipino entrepreneurs organized by Manuel V. Pangilinan’s Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company and Go Negosyo).

As of December 31, 2021; PBB had a total of 165 branches across the country with opening of branches like Candon in Ilocos Sur, La Trinidad in Benguet and Calasiao in Pangasinan. PBB as of December 31, 2022, is the Philippines' second largest savings bank with a Total Assets of ₱155,001.64 billion
