Zeltia


# Zeltia



**Zeltia** is a former Spanish pharmaceutical company which operated through a variety of subsidiaries in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. As of 2007, Zeltia's research activities in the pharmaceutical area had not resulted in a marketed product. However, the company's majority shareholder and chairman are the same person, which has relieved the pressure which many CEOs have experienced to produce immediate returns.


## History

In 1993 Zeltia sells its subsidiary Cooper-Zeltia taking the name CZ Veterinaria, which years later would be renamed Zendal.

The company was taken over by its subsidiary Pharma Mar in a reverse takeover, keeping the Zeltia's Group structure.

In 2018 PharmaMar sells Xylazel to the Dutch company AkzoNobel.

In 2019 PharmaMar sells Zelnova, the group's last subsidiary in Galicia, to the Galician investment company Allentia Invest for 33 million euros.
