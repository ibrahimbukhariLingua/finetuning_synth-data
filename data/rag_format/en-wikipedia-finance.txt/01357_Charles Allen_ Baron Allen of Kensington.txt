## Education

Allen was educated at Bellshill Academy, a state school in the town of Bellshill in North Lanarkshire in central Scotland. He did not attend university, and says of his life, "It's been an amazing journey considering I left school at 17 with no job to go to".


## Career

Allen joined Granada plc in 1991, originally as CEO of Granada Television, before becoming Group Chief Executive in 1996. During his time at Granada, he was instrumental in the takeover of Forte Group for £3.9 billion in 1996, and the takeovers of LWT and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television in 1994 and 1999 respectively. In 2001 Granada Group merged with Compass to form Granada Compass, then demerged into Granada Media plc and Compass Group. He remained with Granada when the two companies demerged, and became Executive Chairman of Granada plc in 2001. When Granada merged with Carlton Communications in 2004 to form ITV plc, Allen became the new company's Chief Executive.

Allen chaired the 2002 Commonwealth Games. He was a member of the London 2012 Olympic bid team and a director of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. He was also Mayor of the Olympic Village.

In May 2021, it was announced that Allen would be the next chairman of the Balfour Beatty construction group, succeeding Philip Aiken from 20 July 2021.

Following criticism of the THG's governance arrangements, Allen replaced Matt Moulding as chairman of THG plc in March 2022.
