Regional stock exchanges of the United States


# Regional stock exchanges of the United States



A **regional stock exchange** is a term used in the United States to describe stock exchanges that operate outside of the country's main financial center in New York City. A regional stock exchange operates in the trading of listed and over-the-counter (OTC) equities under the SEC's Unlisted Trading Privileges (UTP) rule.


## History of regional stock exchanges

The SEC was formed in 1934, and that year, a total of 24 securities exchanges registered with the SEC, while 19 received temporary exemptions from registration. Exchanges actively trading that year included the New Orleans Stock Exchange, the Richmond Stock Exchange, the San Francisco Curb Exchange, the San Francisco Mining Exchange, and the St. Louis Stock Exchange. Ten stock exchanges closed after the SEC was created, including the Boston Curb Market, the Buffalo Stock Exchange, the Chicago Curb Exchange, the Denver Stock Market, the Hartford Stock Market, the Milwaukee Grain and Stock Exchange, the New York Mining Exchange, the New York Real Estate Securities Exchange, the Seattle Stock Exchange, and the Wheeling Stock Exchange. The New York Produce Exchange decided to stop trading in securities as well.

In April 1941, eighteen regional stock exchanges received invitations to "parley" with the SEC on possible amendments to the Securities Act to be presented to Congress that May. The exchange representatives attended the conference on April 28, 1941 to discuss the issue.
