Ivey Business School


# Ivey Business School



**Ivey Business School** is the main business school of the Western University, located in London, Ontario, Canada. It offers full-time undergraduate and graduate programs in London, Ontario and maintains a Toronto facility for its EMBA program and two facilities, Toronto and Hong Kong, for its Ivey Academy (executive education) programs.


## History

Business courses were first taught at Western in 1922 and the business school was officially created in 1950, when the School of Business Administration was established as a separate faculty at Western. In 1995, the school was renamed the Richard Ivey School of Business after an $11 million donation by the Richard M. Ivey family. The school is named after Richard G. Ivey, the father of Richard M. Ivey.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1998, Ivey was the first North American business school to open a campus in Hong Kong offering business programs at the Cheng Yu Tung Management Institute. In 2010, Ivey became the first North American business school to offer the CEMS Global Alliance in Management Education, joining the likes of London School of Economics, HEC Paris, ESADE, University of St. Gallen, and Bocconi University.

In 2013, the School abbreviated its name to "Ivey Business School" and updated its visual identity. The legal name of the Faculty of Business at Western University, however, remains Richard Ivey School of Business.
