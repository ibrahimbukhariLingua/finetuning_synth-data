## History

BiggerPockets was founded in 2004 by Joshua Dorkin. It was originally a message board for real estate investors to ask questions and share best practices. He started the company with no venture capital financing and no outside investment. Dorkin served as the CEO of BiggerPockets for 14 years. Their first employees were hired in 2013.

The company claims over 2.5 million members. As of March 2022, its online forums had 2 million members.

BiggerPockets coined the phrase “BRRRR” to describe a real estate investing strategy of Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. This is similar to the BRRR strategy but includes the additional “R” for Repeat.

In 2006, members of the BiggerPockets message board helped uncover fraud at Pinnacle Development Partners. That resulted in an SEC investigation and later shutdown of the firm after it was revealed to be a Ponzi scheme.

In 2016, the company had annual revenue of $7 million from advertising, memberships, and partnership income.
