Chamberlain of London


# Chamberlain of London



The **Chamberlain of the City of London** is an ancient office of the City of London, dating back to at least 1237.

The Chamberlain is the finance director of the City of London Corporation. They are the financial adviser, accountant, receiver and paymaster and are responsible for the City of London's local and private trust funds. The Chamberlain is responsible for making arrangements for the investment of City of London and other funds and is one of the three official trustees. The role is assisted by the Clerk of the Chamber or Chamberlain's Court, a similarly ancient role. The Lord Mayor of London, elected annually, is the leader of the corporation.

Through the Chamberlain's Court they administer the admission to the Freedom of the City and personally admit all honorary freemen. The Chamberlain is responsible to the Court of Aldermen for constituting new livery companies and for interpreting and amending their ordinances and charters.

The Chamberlain's relationship with the Court of Common Council is the same that applies to other local authority chief finance officers (CFOs) and therefore they have the same responsibilities placed upon them as any other CFO in the United Kingdom.

The current holder of the office is Caroline Al-Beyerty, the 81st Chamberlain in unbroken succession from 1237 to the present. Mrs Al-Beyerty has made history in becoming the first woman to hold this office.


## History

The civic Chamberlain of London (effectively the corporation's Treasurer) should not be confused with the "King's Chamberlain of London" (effectively a royal victualler). Originally responsible for collection and distribution of revenues within the city and nominally appointed by the Crown, the office-holder's term traditionally began on Midsummer Day and cannot be removed "unless some great cause of complaint appear against him".

The Chamberlain was responsible for the Chamber of London, the place where various monies of the city were received and stored. The monies were referred to as the City's Cash although there were other funds such as the City Bridge Fund, administered by the Chief Commoner, and later the City Fund, a fund created to handle the rates.

In 1590, the right of the Chamberlain to levy local taxes on goods sold within the city was upheld in *The Chamberlain of London’s Case* as a valid regulatory measure.

The longest-serving Chamberlain is Benjamin Scott (1858-1892), closely followed by Richard Clark (1798-1831) and Sir Adrian Pollock (1912-1943), all of whom exceeded tenures of thirty years and died in office.

Today the office still has important ceremonial responsibilities, including administering the creation of Freemen of London.
