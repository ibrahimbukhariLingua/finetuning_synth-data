# Cartier Wind Energy



**Cartier Wind Energy** (French: *Cartier Énergie éolienne*) is a developer, owner and operator of wind farms in Quebec. Formed in 2004 as a partnership between TransCanada Corporation (62%) and Innergex Renewable Energy (38%), the Longueuil-based company has built 5 wind farms with a combined capacity of 589.5 MW in the Gaspé peninsula delivering power under a 20-year contract signed in 2005 with Hydro-Québec. The company's sixth project, a 150-MW wind farm in Les Méchins, Quebec, was cancelled in 2010, after Cartier failed to reach an agreement with landowners.
