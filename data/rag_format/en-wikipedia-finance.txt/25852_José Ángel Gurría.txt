### Career in Mexican politics

Gurría served as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1994–1997) in the Ernesto Zedillo administration. In this capacity, he also negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and requested financial aid during the 1994 crisis. Also, he opposed the Helms-Burton Act.

As Secretary of Finance (1998–2000), Gurría oversaw the initial years of Mexico's membership in the OECD and chaired the organization's ministerial council in 1999. Gurría is widely seen as the architect of the Mexican economic stabilization, partially by cutting government spending six times during the Zedillo administration.

In the process, he underwent about 150 interviews in all member countries over the several months to win the backing of governments and OECD officials. During his initial two terms, countries such as Chile, Estonia, and Israel joined the organization. On 26 May 2015, the 34 member countries of the OECD decided to renew Gurría's mandate for the period 2016–2021.
