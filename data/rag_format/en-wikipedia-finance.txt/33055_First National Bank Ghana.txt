## Merger with Ghana Home Loan Bank

In September 2017, the Bank of Ghana directed all universal banks in Ghana to raise their minimum capital reserves from GHS:120 million (US$22.8 million) to GHS:400 million (US$73.4 million). First National Bank Ghana, with the support of its South African parent was able to meet the new minimums. However, Ghana Home Loan Bank (GHLB), an indigenous Ghanaian enterprise had challenges raising new capital. GHLB turned to FNB Ghana to discuss a merger or a buyout.

In May 2020, after regulatory approval from the Reserve Bank of South Africa and the Bank of Ghana, as well as consent from the shareholders of both banks, FNB Ghana acquired 100 percent the shares of Ghana Home Loan Bank. As of 15 May 2020, the process to merge the operations of the two banks were underway. The merger was completed during the second quarter of 2020.
