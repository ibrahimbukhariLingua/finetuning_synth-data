## Criticism by Jim Cramer

In December 2006, *Mad Money* host Jim Cramer used Pisani as an example of an easily manipulated reporter used by hedge fund managers to spread false statements about a company in order to illegally drive the stock price down. Cramer said, "Itâ€™s really important to get the Pisanis of the world and people talking about it as if there is something wrong...". Cramer later apologized to Pisani.
