## History

The second cooperative bank in Italy (the first one was the Banca Popolare di Lodi), was founded in 1865 in Milan by Luigi Luzzatti, who later served as the nation's Prime Minister. Luzzatti drew his inspiration from the 'credit associations' developed by Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Germany a decade earlier.

BPM has grown considerably since the 1950s by buying interests in other banks such as Banca Popolare di Roma (1924–1957), la Banca Briantea, Banca Agricola Milanese, Banca Popolare Cooperativa Vogherese, Banca Popolare di Bologna e Ferrara, Banca Popolare di Apricena, INA Banca, Cassa di Risparmio di Alessandria, Banca di Legnano and Banca Popolare di Mantova.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
