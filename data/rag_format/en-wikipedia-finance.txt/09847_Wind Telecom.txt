# Wind Telecom



**Wind Telecom S.p.A.** (formerly **Weather Investments S.p.A.**) was an Italian telecommunications holding company owned by the multinational VimpelCom Ltd., originally controlled by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris.

It operated through its subsidiaries Orascom Telecom, Wind Hellas and Wind Telecomunicazioni until December 2017, when it merged into VimpelCom.


## History

In June 2005, the company, named Weather Investments, bought Wind Telecomunicazioni, the third largest Italian mobile phone operator, The total value of the transaction was €12.2 billion.

Also in June 2005, 50% plus 1 share of Orascom Telecom was transferred to Weather Investments.

In 2007 the company acquired the Greek mobile carrier TIM Hellas from Apax Partners and Texas Pacific Group and rebranded it Wind Hellas in a deal worth €3.4 billion (£2.4 billion STG). Unfortunately, the Greek crisis brought the carrier in deep financial troubles, forcing Sawiris to sell the assets of the holding company (Weather Finance III) to a group of creditors, the SSN Ad-Hoc Committee. The transaction has been completed in December 2010.

In early 2008 the company acquired the license to operate mobile services in North Korea under the name Koryolink making history by being the first mobile operator there.

In January 2011, the company decided to change its name to Wind Telecom., due to the intention to bring a new image to the group, focusing to the strong points as leading subject in telecommunications and capitalizing all the value and success achieved by the "Wind" brand in recent years, as declared by Khaled Bichara.

Also in January 2011, OTH completed its sale of Tunisian carrier Tunisiana to Qatar Telecom, in a deal worth $1.2 billion, leaving its previously owned 50 percent of Tunisiana through both Orascom Tunisia Holding and Carthage Consortium.

Following the completion of the merger by incorporation of 3 Italy and Wind Telecomunicazioni, which took place in December 2016, the corporate structure of Wind Tre was reorganised, and in December 2017 the cross-border merger by incorporation of Wind Telecom into VimpelCom took place.
