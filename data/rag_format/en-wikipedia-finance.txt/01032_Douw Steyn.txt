## Early life

Douw Gerbrand Steyn was born in December 1952. He went to school in Linden, Johannesburg. He received a bachelor's degree in 1978 from Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education.


## Career

Steyn began his career as a quantity surveyor at Eskom Mega Watt Park.

Steyn founded BGL Group (which was founded as Budget Insurance Company in 1992), a UK-based insurance and financial services company, and the parent of Comparethemarket.com.

In 2015, Steyn launched the development of a luxury private estate, Steyn City, on a 900-hectare (2,200-acre) site between Fourways and Lanseria in Johannesburg. The project initially drew R6.5 billion in investment, with a further R5.5 billion invested in 2019.

## Personal life and death

Steyn was in a relationship with Donne Botha from 2005 to 2009; and on the basis of an extravagant ceremony in London in 2007, Botha claimed in 2014 that they were married, and began a legal bid for half of his estate. In August 2021, the Durban High Court ruled that they were never married, and that a punitive cost order against Botha was warranted.

In February 2013, he married Carolyn Steyn at the Saxon Boutique Hotel, where guests included Graça Machel, Timothy Moloi, and Michael de Pinna.

Steyn passed away on 4 February 2025, at the age of 72.
