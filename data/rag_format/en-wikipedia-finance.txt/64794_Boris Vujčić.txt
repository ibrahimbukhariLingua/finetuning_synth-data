# Boris Vujčić



**Boris Vujčić** (pronounced [bǒris ʋûːjtʃitɕ]; born 2 June 1964) is a Croatian economist, university professor, and the Governor of the Croatian National Bank, a position he has held since 2012.


## Early life

Vujčić graduated from the Zagreb Faculty of Economics in 1988, where he also received his doctorate in 1996.


## Career

Vujčić started his professional career in 1989 as an assistant at the Zagreb Faculty of Economics. In 1996 he was named the head of research department of the Croatian National Bank. Later, in 1997, he became a lecturer at the Zagreb Faculty of Economics and in 2003 an associate professor.

Since 2000, Vujčić has held the position of Vice Governor of the Croatian National Bank, and in 2012 he assumed the position of the governor. He held that position upon Croatia's accession to the European Union. In 2018 the coalition government of prime minister Andrej Plenković agreed to re-appoint Vujčić for a second six-year term.


## Other activities

* European Central Bank (ECB), *ex-officio member* of the Governing Council
* European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), *ex-officio member*
* Vienna Initiative 2.0, member of the Steering Committee
* International Monetary Fund (IMF), *ex-officio member* of the Board of Governors

## Policy positions

During Vujčić's time in office, the Central Bank's monetary policy has largely revolved around keeping the Croatian kuna stable against the euro in a managed float regime. Early in his term, he stated that it remained in Croatia's best interests to join the euro. However, he refused an international bailout scenario as the country faced the post-2008 financial crisis.


## Controversy

In 2014, Vujčić faced calls for his resignation from holders of loans denominated in Swiss francs who struggled with repayments when the kuna surged that year.

In 2017, Croatia's State Commission for Conflict of Interest investigated whether Vujčić allowed a conflict of interest by several times attending an economic conference in Kitzbühel sponsored by UniCredit, the owner of the country's biggest commercial bank Zagrebačka banka.
