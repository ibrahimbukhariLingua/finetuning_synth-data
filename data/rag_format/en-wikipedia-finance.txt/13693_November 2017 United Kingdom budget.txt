### Debate

A debate was held in House of Commons on 22 November 2017. During Jeremy Corbyn's response to the November 2017 Budget on 22 November 2017, Tory Whip Andrew Griffiths heckled him over his comments on the lack of adequate Government funding for care homes. Labour MPs accused Griffiths of ageism and abusive language for shouting that Corbyn belonged in a care home. Griffiths denied this, instead suggesting that he was responding to Corbyn's statement "there are elderly people in need of help," and that he said: "That's you!" Corbyn responded with the comment: "The uncaring, uncouth attitude of certain members of parliament needs to be called out".
