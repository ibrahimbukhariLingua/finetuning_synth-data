# Sapura Group



**Sapura Group**, also known as **Sapura**, is a Malaysian public limited company based in Kuala Lumpur, mainly engaged in oil and gas, manufacturing engineering, property, aviation, defence, and rail construction. Formed in 1975 by Abdul Kadir Shamsuddin, the company was named after his wife, Siti Sapura.


## History

Sapura began with six staff members, in a one-room office. They were mainly involved in the telecommunications industry, with the purchase of Uniphone Works from United Motor Works (now UMW Holdings), in 1975. In the 1980s, the company acquired Malayan Cables Berhad.

By 1991, Sapura consisted of thirty subsidiaries and two publicly listed companies. With its rapid expansion, Sapura became involved in the automotive industry, by establishing Sapura Motor Berhad, in 1994, which was eventually listed on the main board of the nation's primary stock exchange, Bursa Malaysia, and renamed Sapura Industrial Berhad.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
