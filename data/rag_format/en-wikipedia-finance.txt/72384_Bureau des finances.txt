Bureau des finances


# Bureau des finances



The **bureaux** (singular **bureau**) **des Finances** were regional financial administrations in France during the *Ancien Régime*. They were set up after the merger of the offices of Treasurer of France and *général des finances* into Treasurer General of France. They existed from 1577 until 1789 and underwent several modifications during that time.


## History

By the Edict of Poitiers in July 1577, the King of France, Henri III, created the bureaux des finances. In a ruling by the Council on 8 July 1578, he provided for their organization.
