National Livestock Development Board


# National Livestock Development Board



**NLDB (National livestock Development Board),** is a leading state-owned enterprise in Sri Lanka, managing 31 of the largest farms across the country. Spanning over 15,000 hectares, the NLDB focuses on livestock breeding, poultry production, integrated crop and livestock management, and value-added dairy products. With a mission to enhance rural livelihoods and support sustainable agriculture. The Board plays a pivotal role in advancing Sri Lanka's agricultural economy while addressing the diverse needs of farmers in various agro-climatic regions. The NLDB engages in diverse activities, including supplying breeding stock, maintaining and developing coconut plantations, producing value-added milk products, and training farmers in integrated crop and livestock management systems.

Currently, the NLDB owns approximately 15,000 hectares of land, making it the second-largest state-owned landholder in Sri Lanka. Of this, about 4,858 hectares of coconut land within the Coconut Triangle.NLDB farms are utilized for various types of livestock, poultry, and agricultural activities. However, due to governmental corruption and poor management in the past, the NLDB, alongside its counterpart Milco, was considered a strain on the Sri Lankan economy. From 2019 to 2023, a deal was drafted by the previous administration to sell the NLDB to a joint venture of cargills and India's Amul. This plan was halted following the inauguration of the current anti-corruption government, the new president of Sri Lanka appointed a new chairman and an executive staff to revitalize the organization and steer it toward sustainable growth and national development.


## History

**NLDB** was established in 1973 under the State Agricultural Corporation Act No. 11 of 1972, with field operations beginning in 1974. In 1977, its functions were redefined to address the decline in the national herd through intensive cattle upgrading programs for milk and draught purposes and salvaging breedable female cattle. The Board also focused on uplifting the socio-economic standards of rural farmers by supplying breeding stock, maintaining coconut plantations, producing value-added dairy products, and training farmers in integrated crop and livestock management. Lands vested under the Land Reform Law were handed over to the NLDB to establish farms for upgrading indigenous herds to high-producing dairy cattle, particularly through crossbreeding with Sahiwal and European breeds such as Friesian and Jersey. In 1992, thirteen underperforming farms managed by the Department of Animal Production and Health were transferred to the NLDB, requiring significant investment to restore their operations.
