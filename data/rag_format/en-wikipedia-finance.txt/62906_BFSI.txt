## History

The global BFSI Industry faced serious turmoil during the early 21st century, when a series of crises like the subprime mortgage crisis in the US, and the Great Recession worldwide, that began in 2008, gave a huge setback, resulting in negative growth. A 2013 report said that the industry was coming back on track.
