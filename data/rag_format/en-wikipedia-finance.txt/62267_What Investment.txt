What Investment


# What Investment



***What Investment*** was a British magazine last published monthly by Bonhill Group plc. The magazine was established in 1982. The publication is distributed through branches of W H Smith as well as directly to subscribers. The magazine also has an online presence in the form of a website which provides news for retail investors on funds, stocks, shares, and markets.

The online magazine has two weekly newsletters: *What Investment Trader* - which is sent to digital readers on a Monday focussing on direct equity investment, large cap stocks, and day trading (shares, spread betting, CFDs, Forex margin trading, and covered warrants). The traditional *What Investment Newsletter* concentrates on unit trusts, investment trusts, and exchange traded products. *What investment* was created by Gregory Thain, who was also the original publisher. It was an essential source of investment news to the small/medium size investor prior to internet. The magazine launched the extremely successful "joe blogs" column that was often the top performing share tipster in the'80.
