# Fondazione Banca Agricola Mantovana



**Fondazione Banca Agricola Mantovana** is an Italian charity organization based in Mantua, Lombardy. It was found by Banca Agricola Mantovana (BAM) and its parent company Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Banca MPS) in 2000. BAM was transformed from a cooperative bank to a limited company (*società per azioni*) circa 1999–2000.

According to its by-law, BAM had to pay the foundation 2 billion lire (€1.033 million) annually. Since the bank was absorbed into Banca MPS in 2008, Banca MPS inherited the responsibility instead. However, Banca MPS refused to honor the contract. In 2015 the foundation seek arbitration for the non-payment for three years.
