## Film

A film adaptation was released on February 17, 2023, distributed by Shochiku. It starred actor Sadao Abe. The film is an original story that unfolds differently from both the original novel and the TV drama, with its own unique characters.

In the original story, the protagonist of the story changes one after another and Nishiki goes missing in the middle of the story, but in the film version, Nishiki became the main character and played the role of finding out the truth of the case to the end. The film also added an original character, Hajime Sawasaki (acted by Akira Emoto), a guest with a strong personality.

The film was released on Friday, February 17, 2022. According to the weekend movie attendance ranking announced by Kogyo Tsushinsha, it recorded 172,000 attendance and 226 million yen in box-office revenue in the first three days.
By the 27th, the film had attracted 420,000 viewers and grossed 543 million yen, and on the 27th, Sadao Abe, the star of the film, gave a big hit thank-you speech on stage.

The film was nominated Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress at 47th Japan Academy Film Prize.


### Evaluation

On the film review site *Kinema Junpo Web*, film journalist Koremasa Uno criticized the film, saying that the direction of the film was problematic and did not bring out the best in the actors, and that the veteran actors' performances were what held the film together. On the other hand, film critic Reiko Kitagawa said that although the bank financial scandal the film deals with has no impact in itself, she enjoyed watching it because of the anticipation that the smiling lead actor, Sadawo Abe, is going to do something. Film journalist Ryo Kitaura found the interplay between veteran actor Sadao Abe and Akira Emoto very interesting, and recognized that the story had themes common to Jun Ikeido's works, which was a good thing.


### Synopsis (Movie)

**Masahiro Nishiki** is a veteran customer service representative at the Nagahara Branch of Tokyo Daiichi Bank. One day, one million yen in cash goes missing in the branch. While a manhunt is underway for the culprit, Nishiki's subordinate, **Airi Kitagawa**, is suspected, but it turns out to be a false accusation by a female co-worker who had a grudge against her. The bank is full of peculiar people with various circumstances. As Nishiki, together with Airi and his subordinate **Yoji Tabata**, investigates behind the scenes of the cash loss incident at the bank, they come to an unbelievable truth.
