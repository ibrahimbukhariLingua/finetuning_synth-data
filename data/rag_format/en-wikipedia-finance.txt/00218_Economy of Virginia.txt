Northern Virginia (once considered the state's dairy capital) hosts software, communications, consulting, defense contracting, diplomats, and considerable components of the professional government sector.

## Arms and aerospace

Virginia is home to a thriving arms and defense manufacturing industry, with a long history of producing some of the world's most advanced military technology. The state's strategic location on the East Coast of the United States, its robust transportation infrastructure, and its highly skilled workforce make it an ideal location for defense manufacturers.

One of the main reasons why Virginia has a big arms and defense manufacturing industry is its close proximity to Washington, D.C., the center of U.S. military and defense operations. Many defense contractors have established their headquarters or major operations in Northern Virginia to be near key decision-makers and the Pentagon.

In addition to its proximity to the nation's capital, Virginia is also home to several military installations, including the world-renowned Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval base in the world. The state also has several military research facilities, including the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

These military installations and research facilities have helped Virginia become a hub for defense contractors, who work closely with the military to develop and produce advanced technologies. Some of the top defense contractors with a significant presence in Virginia include Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and RTX Corporation.

Virginia's arms and defense manufacturing industry contributes significantly to the state's economy, providing thousands of high-paying jobs and generating billions of dollars in economic activity. In fact, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, the defense industry in Virginia contributes over $36 billion to the state's economy each year and supports over 300,000 jobs.

Overall, Virginia's strong ties to the military, its skilled workforce, and its supportive business environment have made it a leading destination for arms and defense manufacturing companies. As the world's geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, Virginia's position as a hub for military innovation and production is likely to remain secure for many years to come.


## Technology

According to the American Electronics Association, Virginia has the highest concentration of technology workers of any state. Computer chips became the state's highest-grossing export in 2006, surpassing its traditional top exports of coal and tobacco, combined. The Dulles Technology Corridor centered on the border of Fairfax County and Loudoun County near Dulles International Airport has a high concentration of Internet, communication technology and software engineering firms.

The state's biotechnology industry is not centralized, but growing, highlighted by the building of the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park biotech incubator in Richmond and the opening of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm in Northern Virginia.

Virginia's nanotechnology industry, centered in Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia, accounted for $1 billion in manufactured goods in 2006. Researchers in Hampton Roads, many of whom hold patents in the field, believe the region has an advantage in the commercialization of nanotechnology due to the amount of research, much of it spearheaded by NASA's Langley Research Center.

In September 2017, Amazon announced that it would be building a second headquarters in North America, and immediately, several cities in the United States and Canada began submitting their proposals. After much anticipation, Amazon announced in November 2018 that it had chosen two locations for its second headquarters, with one in New York City and the other in Arlington, Virginia. Amazon chose Virginia and opened its 2nd headquarters in Arlington, Virginia in 2023.

The decision to locate in Arlington, Virginia, was significant for several reasons. Firstly, the area had been a leading contender for the HQ2 project, with its proximity to Washington, D.C., and access to major transportation hubs, making it an attractive location for a major tech company like Amazon. The company announced plans to invest $2.5 billion and create over 25,000 high-paying jobs over the next decade, with a focus on hiring local talent and partnering with local universities to develop training programs.


## Finance and banking

Virginia is home to one of the largest banking and finance industries in the United States. The state's location on the East Coast and its proximity to the nation's capital make it an ideal location for financial institutions. Additionally, Virginia's business-friendly environment and highly educated workforce attract many financial companies to the state.

Two of the most prominent financial institutions located in Virginia are Freddie Mac and Capital One. Freddie Mac, which stands for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, is a government-sponsored enterprise that buys and securitizes mortgages in order to provide liquidity to the mortgage market. The company is headquartered in McLean, Virginia, and has been a major player in the mortgage industry since it was created in 1970.

Capital One is a Fortune 500 company that provides a wide range of financial products and services, including credit cards, loans, and banking. The company was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in McLean, Virginia. It has grown rapidly over the years and is now one of the largest credit card issuers in the United States.

In addition to Freddie Mac and Capital One, there are many other financial institutions located in Virginia. Some of the other major players in the state's banking and finance industry include:

* Virginia National Bank: This Charlottesville-based bank provides commercial and personal banking services to individuals and businesses in Virginia.
* TowneBank: Based in Virginia Beach, TowneBank is a community bank that provides a range of financial services to individuals and businesses in Virginia and North Carolina.
* Genworth Financial: This Richmond-based company provides mortgage insurance, long-term care insurance, and other financial products to individuals and businesses.

Virginia's banking and finance industry is a major driver of the state's economy. With companies like Freddie Mac and Capital One located there, as well as a host of other financial institutions, Virginia is well-positioned to continue to be a leader in this important industry.

## Taxation

Virginia collects personal income tax in five income brackets, ranging from 3.0% to 5.75%. The sales and use tax rate is 4%. The tax rate on food is 1.5%. There is an additional 1% local tax, for a total of a 5% combined sales tax on most Virginia purchases and a combined tax rate of 2.5% on food.
Virginia's property tax is set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the commonwealth. Real estate is taxed at the local level based on 100% of fair market value. Effective true tax rates on real estate vary and are set by locality. Tangible personal property also is taxed at the local level and is based on a percentage or percentages of original cost. Tangible personal property includes, but is not limited to, machinery and equipment, furniture, fixtures, and trucks and automobiles. The Virginia General Assembly exempted intangible personal property from taxation in 1984 by making the tax rate zero. Virginia does not collect inheritance taxes; however, its estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the Commonwealth imposes its own estate tax.
