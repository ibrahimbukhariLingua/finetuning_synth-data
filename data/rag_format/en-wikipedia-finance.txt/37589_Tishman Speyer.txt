The firm was founded in 1978 by Robert Tishman and Jerry Speyer.

In March 1988, the company announced its first project in Europe, the construction of a 70-story tower in Frankfurt, Germany, the Messeturm, the tallest tower in Western Europe.

In May 1988, the company acquired the headquarters of J. C. Penney for $350 million in partnership with Trammell Crow Real Estate Investors.

In 1996, the company entered into a joint venture to construct a $175 million, 36-story office building in São Paulo, Brazil.

In 1998, in partnership with The Travelers Companies, the company paid $230 million to acquire the mortgage secured by the Chrysler Building from Fuji Bank.

In 2000, in partnership with Lester Crown, the company acquired Rockefeller Center for $1.85 billion.

In 2002, the company sold Millbank Tower for £115 million.

In 2005, the company acquired the MetLife Building for $1.72 billion.
