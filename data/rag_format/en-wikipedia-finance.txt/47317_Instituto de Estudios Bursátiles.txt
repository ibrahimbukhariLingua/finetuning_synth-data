# Instituto de Estudios Bursátiles



The **Instituto de Estudios Bursátiles** (IEB) is a university and postgraduate training centre specialising in the financial sector and located in Madrid (Spain). Founded in 1989, it is sponsored by the Madrid Stock Exchange and attached to the Complutense University of Madrid and the King Juan Carlos University.


## History

The institution was created with the entry into force of the 1988 Spanish Securities Market Law, which broke the monopoly of the former stock exchange and stockbrokers, and opened financial markets to professionals trained in stockmarket studies.

It was founded by Benito Martínez-Echevarría, former director of the National Institute of Statistics, with the support of Nicolás Cotoner, Antonio Barrera de Irimo, José Ramón Álvarez Rendueles, José María Michavila and Manuel Pizarro. From the outset, the IEB received the support of the then dean of the UCM Law Faculty, José Iturmendi.

The first programme offered by the IEB was the Master in Stock Exchange and Financial Markets, unique at that time; and in 1994 it introduced the double degree for students studying Law at the Complutense University to study simultaneously with the Master in Stock Exchange and Financial Markets.

IEB was launched in 2003 in partnership with London School of Economics, Wharton School of Business, Fordham University, Chinese University of Hong Kong and Bayes Business School.


## Campus

In 2024 the IEB inaugurated a new campus in the Moncloa-Aravaca district of Madrid. Following the aesthetic line of the classical buildings of northern Spain in neo-Gothic architecture, the building attempts to emulate the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The campus, built on a one-hectare site with 4,000 trees, has 31 classrooms equipped with technology, collaborative study areas and green spaces. The library, inspired by the Harry Potter films,[⁸]houses an extensive collection of books on financial, legal and economic topics.

The campus has a BREEAM rating, which certifies compliance with environmental building regulations and energy efficiency.


## Academic programmes

It offers double diplomas: a B.A. in Law or in Economics combined with various M.A. degrees: in Stockexchange and Financial Markets, in International Relations or in Economic Analysis. The centre also offers further post-graduate M.A. degrees: Corporate Finance, International Finance or Auditing, and official Master's degrees such as Access to the Legal Profession and Procurement; training programmes to prepare for financial certifications, as well as training for companies and corporate clients, summer school and other specialisation programmes.

The different programmes are taught in Spanish and bilingually in Spanish and English. It uses the case method with the study of real current situations and the simulation system, taught by professionals in these fields.



## Research activities

Since 2010, research has been conducted through research observatories on financial advice, corporate finance, credit risk management, long-term savings and financial innovation and technology. Editorial work has resulted in publishing research derived from the various Observatories. The IEB publishes the academic journal The IEB AESTIMATIO, International Journal of Finance, whose editorial board is composed of internationally renowned professors, including two Nobel laureates: Harry Markowitz and Lawrence Klein.
