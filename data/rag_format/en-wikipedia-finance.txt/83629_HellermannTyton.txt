# HellermannTyton



**HellermannTyton** is a British registered company with affiliated companies in 37 countries manufacturing and supplying products for fastening, fixing, identifying and protecting cables and their connecting components. The company employs worldwide over 3,800 people. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Delphi Automotive in December 2015.
Delphi has since renamed and separated the part of its business that is focused on automated driving and electrification, calling the new entity Aptiv.


## History

The company was founded by Paul Hellermann and Jack Bowthorpe in Croydon as Hellermann Electric, a subsidiary of Goodliffe Electric Supplies, in 1938. It moved to a new manufacturing site at Crawley in Sussex in 1948.

In 1964 the company acquired Insuloid Manufacturing, a business which had been founded in 1933 by the Emery family in Hulme, Manchester manufacturing bus-bar insulations. It launched the Tyton system, a method for cable bundling in continuous system, in 1965 and established HellermannTyton Corporation in Milwaukee in 1969. Then in 1976 it expanded into the aviation market, offering cable management products for aeroplanes.

The company established operations at Järfälla in Sweden in 1982, at Hyogo in Japan in 1986 and in Wuxi and in Shanghai in China in 1998. It then began harmonising its branding under the single worldwide trademark *HellermannTyton* in 1999. After that, in 2000, it established a new plant at Tornesch near Hamburg with 15,000 m² of production and storage space.

The company was sold by its then owners, Spirent, to funds controlled by Doughty Hanson & Co for £289m in 2006. It was then the subject of an initial public offering in March 2013. In September 2013 Doughty Hanson & Co sold a further 20.9% stake in the company for £119.25m.

In July 2015 Delphi Automotive made an offer to buy the company for $1.7 billion. The acquisition was completed on 18 December 2015 and HellermannTyton became constituent part of Aptiv's Engineered Components Group division.


## Origin of name

The name HellermannTyton is a Portmanteau of the founders surname, Paul Hellermann, and the 1965 invented "Tyton System", a method for cable bundling in continuous system.
