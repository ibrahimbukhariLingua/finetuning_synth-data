## Development History


### Early Years (1959–2001)

In 1959, China Development Corporation was established through the collective efforts of the Economic Stabilization Committee of the Executive Yuan, the World Bank, and public capital as Taiwan's financial institution focusing on direct investments.

In 1999, China Development Corporation was restructured as China Development Industrial Bank (CDIB).

In December 2001, China Development Financial Holding Co., Ltd. (CDF) was established by way of a stock swap.

In 2003: On December 31, CDF merged Grand Cathay Securities and Elite Securities.

In 2005: CDF planned to acquire Jinding Securities, however CDF was not able to get Jinding Securities' original management team to agree. After four years of continuing to buy stocks, in 2009 CDF had finally held a 48% stake in Jingding Securities, but following five years of controversy CDF was ultimately unable to merge with Jingding Securities.

In 2012: CDF publicly acquired the second largest securities firm in Taiwan, KGI Securities, for NT$54.6 billion, with the largest merger in the history of Taiwan.

On June 22 of that same year, KGI Securities merged with Grand Cathay Securities Corporation with KGI being the surviving company.
