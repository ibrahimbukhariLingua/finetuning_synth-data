# InterTradeIreland



**InterTradeIreland** is an all-Ireland economic development agency. It connects and help businesses across the island to trade cross-border, collaborate, innovate and attract investment. Through its unique role it also identifies opportunities for North-South collaboration that accelerate economic growth and help deliver shared policy priorities.

With 25 years’ experience of working alongside businesses of every size in every county on the island of Ireland, InterTradeIreland’s trade, innovation and entrepreneurship pathways help businesses to access funding, advice, experts, and networks across the island to maximise their exports, productivity and growth. To date it has supported over 57,000 businesses and generated €1.8bn/£1.6bn in business development value.

As one of the cross-border bodies established under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, InterTradeIreland is funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the Republic of Ireland and the Department for the Economy (DfE) in Northern Ireland. It is the only organisation which has been given responsibility by both governments to boost North-South economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
