Kansas City SmartPort


# Kansas City SmartPort



**Kansas City SmartPort** is an economic development group for the existing logistics industry in Kansas City, Missouri and the attraction of logistics investments in the Kansas City metropolitan area. KC SmartPort is a non-profit, investor-based organization.


## History

KC SmartPort was born out of the Mid-Continent TradeWay Study, an analysis to "determine the feasibility and national benefits of establishing the Kansas City region as a place where international trade processing activities can be carried out". The study was jointly commissioned in 1998 by the Mid-America Regional Council, the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, and the Kansas City Area Development Council.


## International trade

The current proposal calls for officials from Mexico to inspect and tag cargo and before it is shipped via truck or train expedited through the international border to the Pacific deep water ports at Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán and Manzanillo, Colima, where the exports would be sent to Asia. It is claimed the port would be 15% cheaper than shipping exports to the California ports at San Diego and Los Angeles.
