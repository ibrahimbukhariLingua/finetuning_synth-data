## History

Equity Bank Kenya Limited was incorporated in 2014, as a result of the corporate restructure of its parent company Equity Group Holdings Limited. Prior to November 2014, Equity Group Holdings Limited operated both as a licensed bank and a holding company for its subsidiaries.

On 31 October 2014, Equity Bank announced its intention to incorporate a new, wholly owned subsidiary Equity Bank Kenya Limited, to which it would transfer its Kenyan banking business, assets and liabilities. By converting Equity Group Holdings Limited into a non-trading holding company (as defined under the Banking Act) that owns both banking and non-banking subsidiary companies and provides strategic, brand, risk and personnel management to its subsidiaries, the group would be better able to invest and develop the businesses.

During an extraordinary shareholders general meeting held on 24 November 2014, it was resolved to restructure the firm, leading to the formation of Equity Bank Kenya Limited.

## Controversies and fraud

Equity Bank has found itself in the midst of controversies, especially cyber fraud associated with its ATM cards, Equitel SIM cards, and Eazzybanking (a mobile banking platform) services that lead to the loss of clients' savings. Although the cases are scattered, they have been relatively consistent recently, prompting the bank to issue statements warning customers about the same and adding more security layers to its services. For instance, the bank introduced a one-time PIN to its mobile banking and internet banking services. It is also suspected that some cases are a result of inside job from unethical employees and agents and that refunds are not guaranteed with some clients reporting threats and intimidation when making followups.

In the past, Equity Bank employees have also been implicated in tax evasion scandals. In 2016, the bank surrendered two of its employees to the KRA for prosecution over their role in facilitating tax evasion, in which Ksh.124 million in import duty was lost.

In January 2021, Equity Bank Congo was embroiled in a controversy with the Congolese Central Bank after its merger with the country’s second-largest bank, Banque Commerciale du Congo (BCDC). In the middle of the controversy was a memo in which James Mwangi unilaterally announced plans to integrate BCDC's operations and data into Equity Group's database, set up an initial management committee, and appoint two managing directors. The Banque Centrale du Congo disapproved of the decisions arguing that the "Legal and regulatory requirements do not allow for two managing directors to oversee one institution" and that Mr. Mwangi had no capacity to make the decisions as he was only a "representative of a shareholder and has not been mandated by the acquiring company to make decisions on its behalf."

In May 2023, a customer sued the lender for an alleged breach of their privacy after the bank shared his information with an unauthorized third party without consent.

In April 2024, reports emerged that a 7-day hackers expedition made away with Ksh 179,677,736 from 551 customers through debit card fraud.
