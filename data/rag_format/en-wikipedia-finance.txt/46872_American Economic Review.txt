American Economic Review


# American Economic Review



The ***American Economic Review*** is a monthly peer-reviewed academic journal first published by the American Economic Association in 1911. The current editor-in-chief is Erzo FP Luttmer, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. The journal is based in Pittsburgh.

In 2004, the *American Economic Review* began requiring "data and code sufficient to permit replication" of a paper's results, which is then posted on the journal's website. Exceptions are made for proprietary data.

Until 2017, the May issue of the *American Economic Review*, titled the *Papers and Proceedings* issue, featured the papers presented at the American Economic Association's annual meeting that January. After being selected for presentation, the papers in the *Papers and Proceedings* issue did not undergo a formal process of peer review. Starting in 2018, papers presented at the annual meetings have been published in a separate journal, *AEA Papers and Proceedings*, which is released annually in May.


## History

The American Economic Association was founded in 1885. From 1856 until 1907 the association published the *Publications of the American Economic Association*. The first volume was published in six issues, from March 1886 to January 1887. The second volume in 1887â€“1888, and so on, until Volume XI in 1896. In that same year an issue with "General Contents and Index of Volumes I to XI" appeared. Most of the volumes contained only one text, for instance volume IV, issue 2 (April 1889) which contained an article by Sidney Webb, entitled "Socialism in England".

In December 1897, a new series started, with only two issues.

In 1900 the third series started, with four issues yearly; this lasted until 1908.

For the next three years the association published what was called *The Economic Bulletin.* It also appeared in four issues yearly. Every issue of the *Bulletin* contained a section "Personal and Miscellaneous Notes" and a number of book reviews.

In parallel with the *Bulletin*, during the years 1908 to 1910 appeared the *American Economic Association Quarterly.* Its header read "Formerly published under the title of Publications of the American Economic Association and the numbering continued as third series, volumes 9 to 11.

In March 1911, the first issue of *The American Economic Review* saw the light.
