**PT Digital Aplikasi Solusi**, traded as **Digiserve** (formerly known as **PT Teltranet Aplikasi Solusi** or **Telkomtelstra**), is a telecommunications company based in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was formed as a joint venture between Telkom Indonesia, the nation's largest fixed-line operator, and Australian telecommunications company, Telstra. Digiserve offers managed network services, WAN optimisation, managed cloud services, software as a service, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, unified communication and collaboration services, managed security services, and professional services. The joint venture was formed in October 2014, and has over 100 employees.


## History

The birth of Digiserve (then known as telkomtelstra) came from an initial meeting and MOU between two companies, Telkom Indonesia and Telstra, an Australian company. The joint venture agreement was finalized between the two companies’ parents on 29 August 2014. The idea was to select and jointly share specialised resources of the two companies in order to create a new joint venture to be the exclusive provider of network application services (NAS) to business clients in Indonesia, South-East Asia’s largest economy.

PT Teltranet Aplikasi Solusi (telkomtelstra) was established by notarial deed No. 36 in Jakarta. The deed of establishment was approved by the Minister of Justice of the Republic of Indonesia in his decision letter No AHU-31520.40.10.2014, dated 27 October 2014. Since its foundation, it has expanded to include a range of different services, and has been awarded “the most innovative partnership award” by the IDC.

On 30 September 2021, Telkomtelstra was rebranded as Digiserve after Telkom acquired Telstra's remaining shares.
