## History

Avation was founded in 2006 by Jeff Chatfield. The company was originally formed via a special dividend from Skywest Airlines Ltd with shares distributed in specie to all of the then Skywest Airlines Ltd shareholders.

The company was initially a narrow-body jet lessor which leased Fokker 100 and Airbus A320/A321 aircraft to Skywest Airlines Ltd and other airlines. In 2011 the Company ordered its first ATR72 aircraft and leased them to Skywest Airlines Ltd. On 11 April 2013 Virgin Australia Holdings completed its 100% acquisition of Skywest Airlines Ltd.

Since the Virgin Australia acquisition of Skywest Airlines Ltd, Avation has continued to grow organically as an independent aircraft leasing company. The Company developed its portfolio through a turboprop order book with ATR and has steadily added narrow-body and wide-body aircraft to its fleet. To fund these acquisitions Avation has issued bonds and shares on the London Stock Exchange.

In December 2019 Avation PLC procured the World's first certified aircraft green loan for a new commercial aircraft from Deutsche Bank. Sustainability indicator has been independently verified by the agency Vigeo Eiris.
