RecargaPay


# RecargaPay



**RecargaPay** is a Brazilian fintech company that provides online money services. It was founded in 2010 by Rodrigo Teijeiro, Alvaro Teijeiro, and Gustavo Victorica. The company has over 300 employees based mainly in São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Miami, USA.


## History

The company was founded in 2010 by brothers Rodrigo and Álvaro Teijeiro, currently CEO and CTO respectively, and Gustavo Victorica, current COO.

Recarga.com operated in Latin America and in the United States under the ownership of Fnbox, a technology holding company that manages various online businesses. By August 2012, the company had processed transactions in six countries for 110,000 customers across more than twenty mobile carriers.

In 2013, Fnbox began a process of dismemberment to focus exclusively on the mobile recharge business. Consequently, Recarga.com became RecargaPay, and diversified its product offering.

In February 2018 RecargaPay had raised $63 million in venture capital from a group of investors including IFC, TheVentureCity, DN Capital, Fabrice Grinda, Martin Varsavsky.

RecargaPay is considered the largest mobile payments and digital financial services ecosystem in Brazil. In September 2018 RecargaPay launched its first physical product: a prepaid card.


## Services

RecargaPay allows payments through credit card, debit card, Livelo points, PIX, or its wallet which can be loaded via boleto, deposit, or bank transfer. In the free plan, payments up to 500 reais have no extra charges, and in the Prime+ plan, it's up to 2,000 reais a month.

Some merchants resell RecargaPay's services to attract customers, using phone recharges and bill payments for incentives.

RecargaPay supports multiple carriers: Claro, TIM, Vivo, Oi, Correios, Sercomtel, Algar, and Surf Telecom. It offers scheduled recharges, and an Offline Recharge option for those without credits.

The service covers transportation cards from various cities, such as Bilhete Único and Cartão TRI, and offers cashback on the first recharge up to 20 reais with an automatic recharge option.
