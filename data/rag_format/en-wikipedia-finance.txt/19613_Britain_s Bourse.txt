## History

Inigo Jones submitted a design, but these were not used. It was built by Sir Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Building commenced on 10 June 1608. The site had previously been occupied by the stables of Durham House, now 52 to 64 Strand.

The building was briefly known as the Salisbury Exchange, but was renamed when James I opened the building on 11 April 1609. He was accompanied by his queen, Anne of Denmark, his son, later Charles I of England and daughter Elizabeth, later Queen of Bohemia. The opening included a theatrical production by Ben Jonson, *The Entertainment at Britain's Burse*.

Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany visited the premises during his visit to England in 1669 and described the building:
