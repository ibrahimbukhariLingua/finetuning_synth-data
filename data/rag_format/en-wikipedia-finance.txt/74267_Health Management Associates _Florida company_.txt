## 2012 Allegations of Medicare Fraud

In 2012, the CBS show, "60 Minutes," interviewed over 100 former employees of HMA. These former employees criticized HMA of implementing unethical for-profit measures. They alleged that HMA has established hospital admission goals of 20% or higher that their physicians must adhere to, or face termination. The former employees said that these goals had resulted in an admission of more than 50% of patients aged 65 or over, regardless of medical need. Paul Meyers, HMA's former director of compliance and a 30-year FBI veteran, accused the chain of Medicare fraud. The hospital chain is being investigated by the US Justice Department, Kroft added, which has subpoenaed records pertaining to emergency-room management and a software program used by ER doctors.


## 2014 Allegations of attempt to inflate bills

In 2014, The New York Times reported that the Justice Department had joined eight separate whistle-blower lawsuits against HMA in six states. The lawsuits alleged a wide-ranging strategy that attempted to inflate HMA's payments from Medicare and Medicaid by increasing hospital admissions. The Justice Department accused HMA of admitting patients to hospitals regardless of whether they needed hospital care and pressuring doctors to admit patients to the hospital. Page Vaughan, who is accused of pressuring doctors to wrongfully admit is working at a small rural hospital in Chester, South Carolina as of 2014.
