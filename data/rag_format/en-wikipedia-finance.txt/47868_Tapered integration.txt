Tapered integration


# Tapered integration



**Tapered integration** is a term from organization theory that refers to a mix of vertical integration and market exchange. Upstream, a producer might manufacture some of the input itself and buy the remaining portion from independent firms. Downstream, the manufacturer might sell a portion of its output through an in-house sales force and use independent sales forces to sell the remainder.

It is not documented when the term *tapered integration* was first used, though it can be found in law journals such as the Yale Law Journal as early as the 1950s, the first known use in academia being a case study by William King Norris.


## Examples

Examples for tapered integration are (1) Tim Hortons owning some of its retail outlets but also using franchising, (2) Coca-Cola and Pepsi both having integrated bottling subsidiaries while also relying on independent bottlers for production and distribution in some markets, or (3) BMW which uses both in-house market research from its Corporate Center Development and external market research from independent, specialized firms.


## Advantages/Disadvantages


### Advantages

* Use of internal cost information to negotiate contracts with market firms
* Motivation tool for both internal division and market firms
* Protection against holdup risk

### Disadvantages

* Both internal and external production may stay below minimum eff. scale
* coordination and monitoring problems
* Inefficient internal divisions may be kept when not efficient
