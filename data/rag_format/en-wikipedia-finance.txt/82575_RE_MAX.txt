## History


### Early history: 1970–76

RE/MAX was founded in January 1973 by Dave Liniger and Gail Main (who later married Liniger and became Gail Liniger) in Denver, Colorado.

The company was established with a maximum commission concept, meaning that agents would keep nearly all of their commissions and pay their broker a share of the office expenses, rather than paying their broker a share of the commission of each sale, which is common in residential real estate.

In 1975, Dennis Curtin purchased the first RE/MAX franchise outside of Colorado, in Kansas City, Missouri. The company grew to 100 franchises in two years. RE/MAX held its first convention in Las Vegas in 1976, which became an annual event.


### International expansion: 1977–98

RE/MAX opened its first office outside the United States in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1977, started by Don Fernie as **RE/MAX South**. By 1981, the company had 30 franchises in Canada,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and in 1987, RE/MAX became the top real estate company in Canada.

In 1978, the RE/MAX Hot Air Balloon—a red, white and blue hot air balloon—was introduced, taking its maiden flight at the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta in New Mexico. A year later in 1979, the balloon became the company's official logo.

In 1994, the company expanded outside North America with the establishment of **RE/MAX Europe**. Regional operations expanded in Germany, Italy, Spain, and South Africa.

In November 1994, the RE/MAX Satellite Network (RSN; renamed RE/MAX University in the 2000s)—a satellite training system for real estate—was launched in the US, debuting at the National Association of Realtors Convention in Anaheim, California. The RSN offered training, professional designation courses, and company news.

RE/MAX expanded to Australia and New Zealand in 1996.

In 1998, Liniger attempted the first manned balloon flight around the world in a stratospheric gas balloon. The flight was canceled due to design and weather problems.
