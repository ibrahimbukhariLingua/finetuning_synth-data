Canadian Silver Maple Leaf


# Canadian Silver Maple Leaf



The **Canadian Silver Maple Leaf** is a silver bullion coin that is issued annually by the Government of Canada since 1988. It is produced by the Royal Canadian Mint.

The Silver Maple Leaf is legal tender. The face value is 5 Canadian dollars. The market value of the metal varies, depending on the spot price of silver. The standard version has a weight of 1 troy ounce (31.1 grams).

The Silver Maple Leaf's obverse and reverse display, respectively, the profile of Charles III and the Canadian Maple Leaf. In 2014, new security features were introduced: radial lines and a micro-engraved laser mark.


## History

The Silver Maple Leaf is issued annually by the Government of Canada. Introduced in 1988 by the Royal Canadian Mint, there have been four subsequent standard editions and several special editions.

The Silver Maple Leaf's obverse displayed the profile of Elizabeth II up until 2023. There have been three subsequent versions of the Queen's profile:

* 1988–1989: Portrait by Arnold Machin.
* 1990–2003: Portrait by Dora de Pédery-Hunt.
* 2004–2023: Portrait by Susanna Blunt.

Canadian coins released to the public starting in 2024 now bear a new obverse of her successor King Charles III.

* 2024–Present: Portrait by Steven Rosati.

The Silver Maple Leaf's reverse displays the Canadian Maple Leaf. This design has remained unchanged since 1988. In 2014, however, new security features were introduced: radial lines and a micro-engraved laser mark. Also the obverse was affected by this.

The phrases CANADA and FINE SILVER 1 OZ ARGENT PUR are universal elements.

Granted a face value of 5 Canadian dollars, the Silver Maple Leaf has status as legal tender. It has also a market value that depends on the spot price of silver and that normally exceeds the nominal face value. With few exceptions and alike similar international bullion coins, the Silver Maple Leaf has a weight of 1 troy ounce (31.1 grams). The 99.99% silver content makes the coin among the finest official bullion coins worldwide.

Samples of the Silver Maple Leaf often carry a blemish that has a milky-white appearance, called a milk spot. This happens when a cleaning detergent is left on the coin when it goes into the annealing furnace.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ. This issue was addressed in 2018 with the RCM introduction of "MINTSHIELD" surface protection technology to prevent milk spots.

The Silver Maple Leaf was originally packaged in Mylar. Since 2009, due to increasing demand, it is packaged in semi-transparent tubes with a yellow lid bearing the RCM logo. Some special editions have tubes with an orange, red, blue, dark blue or grey lid. Each tube contains 25 coins. Furthermore, there exist boxes that contain 20 tubes each.
