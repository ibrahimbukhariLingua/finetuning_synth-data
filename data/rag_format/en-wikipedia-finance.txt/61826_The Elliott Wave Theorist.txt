The Elliott Wave Theorist


# The Elliott Wave Theorist



***The Elliott Wave Theorist*** is a monthly newsletter published by Elliott Wave International. The first issue of the *Theorist* was published in April 1976 and has been continuously in print on a subscription basis since May 1979. The publication includes Elliott wave analysis of the financial markets and cultural trends, plus commentary on topics that include technical analysis, behavioral finance, physics, pattern recognition, and socionomics. Robert Prechter is the publication's editor and main contributor.


## History

The *Theorist* began as Robert Prechter's vehicle for Elliott wave market opinions when he worked as a technical analyst at Merrill Lynch. The publication gathered a following, and Prechter continued to offer it via subscriptions after he left Merrill in 1979.
In the early 1980s, the *Theorist* issued an aggressively bullish stock market forecast; its prominence grew, and the number of subscribers eventually reaching some 20,000. That number declined in the 1990s (as did subscription levels among financial publishers generally), though the *Theorist* remains frequently cited on financial websites, in blogsᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, newsgroups, books, scholarly papers, and by major media.
The newsletter has earned several awards, including *Hard Money Digest's* "Newsletter Award of Excellence," and *Timer Digest's* "Timer of the Year." The *Theorist* has also included commentary for which contributors were criticized, including the forecast of a long-term bear market in the U.S. stock market.


## Distinction and controversy

The *Theorist* has featured several topics of distinction and controversy. Prechter's August 1985 *Theorist* essay "Pop Culture and the Stock Market" preceded a shorter version of the September 1985 cover story essay in *Barron's*, "Elvis, Frankenstein and Andy Warhol." Following Benoit Mandelbrot's 1999 *Scientific American* article "A Fractal Walk Down Wall Street," the *Theorist* ran detailed criticism of that article, saying that Mandelbrot took credit for ideas that "originated with Ralph Nelson Elliott, who put them forth more comprehensively and more accurately with respect to real-world markets in his 1938 book The Wave Principle." In recent years the *Theorist* has been credited with popularizing market indicators such as the “skyscraper indicator,” and been a forum for ideas and research regarding socionomics from Prechter and others, such as the 2006 essay, “Social Mood and Automobile Styling,” which received wide media coverage.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
