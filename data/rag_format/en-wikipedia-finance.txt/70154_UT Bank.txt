## History

In 1997, Joseph Nsonamoa and Prince Kofi Amoabeng co-founded Financial Services and then renamed it Unique Trust Financial Services. UT Financial Services was a non-bank financial services provider (NBFI) in Ghana, which was incorporated in 1997. Over time, the NBFI acquired subsidiaries and was listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange, under its holding company, UT Holdings Limited.

In 2008, UT (Unique Trust) Holdings Limited acquired majority shareholding in a Ghanaian commercial bank called BPI Bank. The bank was re-branded as UT Bank Ghana Limited and opened for business in May 2009.

In June 2010, UT Bank and UT Financial Services merged into one company called UT Bank Ghana Limited. Through a reverse listing on the Ghana Stock Exchange, the new bank's shares became listed and those of UT Holdings were de-listed. Its shares traded under the symbol UTB.

The bank's total assets in December 2011 were valued at approximately US$378.4 million (GHS:712.9 million), with shareholders' equity of approximately US$32.5 million (GHS:61.23 million).

On August 14, 2017, the Central Bank of Ghana issued a statement to the press indicating that the license of UT Bank had been revoked, along with that of another Ghanaian owned bank (Capital Bank). In the statement, the Central Bank also approved the take-over of UT Bank and Capital Bank by GCB Bank Limited. The first paragraph of the statement read, "The Bank of Ghana has approved a Purchase and Assumption transaction with GCB Bank Ltd that transfers all deposits and selected assets of UT Bank Ltd and Capital Bank Ltd to GCB Bank Ltd. The Bank of Ghana has revoked the Licences of UT Bank Ltd and Capital Bank Ltd. This action has become necessary due to severe impairment of their capital. The remaining assets and liabilities will be realised and settled respectively through a receivership process to be undertaken by Messers Vish Ashiagbor and Eric Nana Nipah of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)".

On the same day, the Ghana Stock Exchange announced that it had suspended the listing of UT Bank indefinitely.
