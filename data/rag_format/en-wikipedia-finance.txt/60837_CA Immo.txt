## History

CA Immo was founded in 1987 as part of Creditanstalt-Bankverein, an Austrian commercial bank and has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange [HC1] since 1988; since April 2007, CA Immo shares have been traded on the Prime Market.

With a stake of around 60% of the share capital, SOF-11 Klimt CAI S.à. r.l., Luxembourg, a company managed by Starwood Capital Group, is the Company's largest shareholder. The remaining approximately 40% of the shares are in free float (as of April 2023).

In 2008, CA Immo acquired the German Vivico Real Estate GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, including all non-operational land and brownfield sites of Deutsche Bahn as well as the branches in Munich, Berlin and Frankfurt, as part of its expansion plans in Germany. Since 2008, CA Immo has been one of the most active office developers in Germany

At the beginning of 2011, CA Immo acquired the property subsidiary of the Österreichischen Volksbanken Gruppe (ÖVAG) and thereby significantly expanded its portfolio in Eastern Europe.

The company employs more than 400 people in Austria, Germany and Eastern Europe (as of November 2022).

A longstanding goal of CA Immo was to merge with or take over its fellow ATX member Immofinanz. Merger negotiations failed in 2014, as did a takeover bid by CA Immo in spring 2015. In August 2016, CA Immo's then core shareholder O1 Group, controlled by Russian real estate billionaire Boris Mints and his son Dmitry Mints, sold its 26% stake in CA Immo to Austrian real estate investor Immofinanz, whose goal was also to merge the two companies. After this plan failed, Immofinanz sold its stake in CA Immo to Starwood Group at the end of September 2018.
