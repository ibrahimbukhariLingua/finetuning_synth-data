## History

Bergesen Worldwide started as Bergesen d.y. when it was founded by Sigval Bergesen d.y. in 1935. He built up a major tanking fleet and left the business to his grandchildren Petter C.G. Sundt and Morten Sig. Bergesen in 1976 and the company changed from primarily a tanker to a gas carrier operator. The company grew in the gas sector throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003 Bergesen was merged with World-Wide Shipping and became Bergesen Worldwide. The merger resulted in Bergesen Worldwide Gas to become demerged and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange in 2005.
