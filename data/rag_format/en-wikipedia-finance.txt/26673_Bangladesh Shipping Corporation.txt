# Bangladesh Shipping Corporation



**Bangladesh Shipping Corporation** is a state-owned, autonomous corporation in Bangladesh. It owns a number of ships and oil tankers, and also charters sea-going vessels from other operators.

## History

In 1971, Pakistan's National Shipping Corporation took all the merchant fleet. Beginning in 1972, Bangladesh inherited no merchant vessel registered under its flag. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman realized the importance of the shipping sector at that time. On 5 February 1972, he established 'Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) under the President Order no-10 of 1972. On 10 June of the same year, BSC acquired the first national ship 'Banglar Doot' which was the first registered ship in independent Bangladesh. Soon after, BSC acquired 'Banglar Sampad'

It purchased its first ship in 1974. The ship was named *Banglar Doot* (Ambassador of Bengal). As of 2001, the corporation owned 13 ships, two of which are oil tankers.

In March 2022, Bangladesh Shipping Corporation requested $22.4M from its insurer, Sadharan Bima Corporation, after its cargo ship Banglar Samriddhi was hit by a missile while docked at the Olvia port in Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
