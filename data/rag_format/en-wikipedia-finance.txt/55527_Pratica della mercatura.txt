Pratica della mercatura


# Pratica della mercatura



The ***Practica della mercatura*** (Italian for "**The Practice of Commerce**"), also known as the ***Merchant's Handbook***, is a comprehensive guide to international trade in 14th-century Eurasia and North Africa as known to its compiler, the Florentine banker Francesco Balducci Pegolotti. It was written sometime between 1335 and 1343, the most likely dates being 1339 or 1340. Its original title was the ***Book of Descriptions of Lands*** (**Libro di divisamenti di paesi**); its more common name is that from its first printing in 1766. Pegolotti's work is based on his own experience as a banker and merchant for the Bardi, and on various local documents, statutes and price lists available to him.


## History

No autograph survives. The sole surviving manuscript, used by all the printed editions, is that in the Biblioteca Riccardiana at Florence. It states that it was copied on 19 March 1472 by Filippo di Niccolaio Frescobaldi from a copy held by Agnolo di Lotti of Anella, who claimed it had been made from Pegolotti's original.

Pegolotti seems to have had access to an earlier, much more limited, compilation made at Pisa in 1279, now preserved in the Biblioteca Comunale at Siena, entitled *Memoria de Tucte le Mercantie*.

Pegolotti's work was probably used by the compiler of the Venetian trade manual *Tarifa zoè noticia dy pexi e mexure di luogi e tere che s'adovra marcadantia per el mondo* in the 1340s. It then served as a source for a later work which shares its title, the *Pratica della mercatura* compiled by Giovanni di Bernardo da Uzzano in 1442. Soon afterwards it was drawn on by the author of *Libro che tracta di mercatantie et usanze de' paesi*, compiled in 1458 probably by Giorgio Chiarini, afterwards incorporated in Luca Pacioli's *Summa de arithmetica*.
