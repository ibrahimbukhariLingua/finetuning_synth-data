2012 Irish budget


# 2012 Irish budget



The **2012 Irish budget** was the Irish Government budget for the 2012 fiscal year, the first budget of the 29th Government of Ireland. It was presented to Dáil Éireann in two parts on 5–6 December 2011, with the first part delivered by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin, and the second part delivered by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan. The budget contained tax increases, and spending cuts of €3.6bn for 2012.


## Before the budget

The budget was preceded by a rare televised national address by a Taoiseach when Enda Kenny spoke to the country two days beforehand. This was only the sixth time that a Taoiseach has addressed the nation, reflecting the gravity of the Irish economic condition, in what Kenny stressed were "exceptional" circumstances. The address drew the second highest television audience of the year on Irish television. The following day, Thomas Pringle TD replied on television in an address on behalf of the opposition technical group of TDs in Dáil Éireann.

In another departure from tradition, the cuts in public spending were announced the day before Budget Day by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report.
