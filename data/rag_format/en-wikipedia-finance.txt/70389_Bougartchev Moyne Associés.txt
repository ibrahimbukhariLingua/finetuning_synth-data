## History

The litigation firm Bougartchev Moyne Associés opened on January 2, 2017, in Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. The two founders Kiril Bougartchev and Emmanuel Moyne, both business crime lawyers for 30 and 20 years respectively, had previously worked for Gide and then Linklaters in Paris. Bougartchev Moyne Associés sponsored the International Bar Association (IBA) Anti-Corruption Conference in June 2017 in Paris.

In 2017, the *Chambers Europe* guide named the firm among its ranked lawyers, among band 1 law firms in white-collar crime and band 2 firms in corporate compliance and investigations. The firm was also granted awards by the French *Décideurs* magazine, which named Bougartchev Moyne Associés one of the "essential" Top 2017 Law Firms in France for business criminal law in 2017. It also named the firm "excellent" among the Top 2017 Law Firms in France for international investigation. The *Legal 500* guide named the firm among the best ones in two categories of its 2017 ranking, i.e. white-collar crime as well as commercial and corporate litigation. The partners of the firm participated in round-table discussions at the Global Anti-Corruption Summit organized by the Business & Legal Forum in March 2017. In September 2017, Chambers and Partners published *Anti-Corruption 2018*, with the "France" chapter written by the firm.

In January 2021, Bougartchev Moyne Associés named a third partner, Geoffroy Goubin. He has been an attorney at the firm since it was formed. He was previously at Debevoise & Plimpton, then at Linklaters, where an association with the two firm founders began.
