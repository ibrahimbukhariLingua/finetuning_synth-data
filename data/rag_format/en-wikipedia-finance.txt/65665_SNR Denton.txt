SNR Denton


# SNR Denton



**SNR Denton** was a multinational law firm co-headquartered in London and Washington, D.C. The firm operated in 60 locations across 43 countries and had around 1,250 lawyers. It was one of the 25-largest law firms in the world, with revenues of around $750 million in 2011/12.

SNR Denton was formed through the merger of the UK-based Denton Wilde Sapte LLP and the US-based Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal LLP in September 2010. The firm was structured as a Swiss Verein and had a single management board but the partnerships of the predecessor firms were not financially integrated. In March 2013, SNR Denton merged with the international law firm Salans and the Canada-based law firm Fraser Milner Casgrain, forming Dentons.

*The American Lawyer* estimated SNR Denton to be the 29th largest law firm in the world by number of lawyers and 43rd by annual revenue in 2012, its last full year of operation.


## History

In 1785, Thomas Wilde (1758-1821) and Samuel Archer Hussey founded a law firm that became Wilde Sapte. In 1788, Denton Hall Burgin was established by Sam Denton. In 1906, Edward Sonnenschein and partners opened a law firm in Chicago that eventually became Sonnenschein Nath Rosenthal.

In 2000, the City of London-based law firms Denton Hall and Wilde Sapte merged to form Denton Wilde Sapte. In 2009, 100 lawyers (including 40 partners) joined Sonnenschein from Thacher Proffitt & Wood, doubling the firm's number of lawyers in New York. In May 2010, Denton Wilde Sapte and Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal announced their intention to merge. On 30 September 2010, the merger between Denton Wilde Sapte and Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal was formally completed, establishing SNR Denton.

In January 2011, SNR Denton opened in Hong Kong following the assimilation of the Hong Kong office of Hammonds.

On 11 November 2012, SNR Denton, Salans and the Canada-based Fraser Milner Casgrain announced a three-way merger, forming a new law firm structured as a Swiss Verein and named Dentons. The partners of the three firms ratified the merger on 28 November 2012 and the new firm was planned to begin operations in early 2013.

In January 2013, SNR Denton entered into an association with the Kuwaiti law firm Jamal Ahmed Al-Shehab.

The merger between SNR Denton, Fraser Milner Casgrain and Salans was completed on 28 March 2013.
