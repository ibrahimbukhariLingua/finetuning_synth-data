Draghi report


# Draghi report



The **Draghi report** is a 2024 report addressing European competitiveness and the future of the European Union. Authored by former ECB president and former Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi, it was one of two widely anticipated reports on EU reforms in 2024, together with the Letta report on the EU internal market. Parts of the Draghi report's proposals have already been adopted by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for the work programme of her 2024–2029 Commission term.

### Competitiveness

Draghi's report urges the EU to foster more investment to increase European productivity. The report proposes new prudential rules for banking and institutional investors to facilitate risky investments. Draghi warned that if the EU failed to catch up with its rivals, it would face 'slow agony'. He wrote that the EU "needs far more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace economically with rivals the United States and China. The report was expected to affect transatlantic ties in the years to come.


### EU budget

The report supports joint borrowing, something von der Leyen and various member states immediately rejected.


## Reactions

The report was eagerly awaited by some, and initial reactions from think-tankers were mixed, while *The Economist* compared the plan's scope to the 1948 Marshall Plan. A report out of Chatham House opined that "Stark recommendations in the report risk being thwarted by a European leadership vacuum – and a lacking sense of urgency."

Critics pointed to a lack of representation of the consulted stakeholders to produce the report. Central and Eastern Europe as well as the civil society and trade unions were underrepresented, making the report focusing too much on core European countries and on business interests, and addressing social and ecological challenges with fewer points of view.

French economist Thomas Piketty welcomed the report as "going in the right direction" and "having the immense merit of overturning the dogma of fiscal austerity".
