## History

The need for an agricultural retailing system evolved through the mid-19th century; and, in 1896, the first Felleskjøp, Landhusholdningselskaberbnes Fællesinnkjøbsforening was founded, soon followed by more. Eventually they started to merge, and 2006 saw the merger between Felleskjøpet Trondheim and Felleskjøpet ØstVest to Felleskjøpet Agri, creating a company covering almost the entire country.
