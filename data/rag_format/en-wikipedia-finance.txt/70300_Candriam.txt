## History

The company was founded as Dexia Asset Management, a branch of Dexia S.A, in 1996. Following its acquisition by New York Life Investments in February 2014, the company changed its name to Candriam, which supposedly stands for "**C**onviction **AND** **R**esponsibility **I**n **A**sset **M**anagement", representing two of the company's core values.

The company received the award of "European Asset Manager of the Year" for two years in a row in 2015 and 2016 and was listed among MacKay Williams's top ranking for future leading names in asset management in 2016.

In 2018 the company successfully acquired a 40% equity stake in London-based real estate manager Tristan Capital Partners, as well as ABN-Amro's direct management unit, representing €8bn in AUM.

In September 2019 the company announced it was carbon-neutral with all carbon emissions generated being offset. Including scope 1 (fuel, mainly vehicles), scope 2 emissions (energy for buildings) plus business travel as well as supplier related emissions (as part of scope 3).

In June 2020, the company signed an agreement to transfer Rothschild & Co Asset Management Europe's alternative multi-asset management business to Candriam. The transaction concerns open-ended funds domiciled in France and Luxembourg and dedicated institutional funds, representing total assets under management of almost 350 million euros.

Candriam has been a pioneer in Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI) since 1996. The company states that investment opportunities and risks can't be fully evaluated using traditional financial measures alone and that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria should be taken into consideration.
