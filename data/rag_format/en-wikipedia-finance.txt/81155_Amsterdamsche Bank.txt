Amsterdamsche Bank


# Amsterdamsche Bank



The **Amsterdamsche Bank** was a significant bank in the Netherlands, founded in 1871. In 1964, it merged with Rotterdamsche Bank to form AMRO Bank (for AMsterdamsche & ROtterdamsche).


## Overview

Amsterdamsche Bank was established on 5 December 1871 by a group of mainly German investors led by the Bank für Handel und Industrie (Darmstadt), in the context of German financial expansion following its victory of the Franco-Prussian War. It expanded rapidly from its base in Amsterdam to other cities in the Netherlands. In 1948 it took over Incasso Bank [nl] (est. 1891), which it fully absorbed in 1956.

Its elegant Art Nouveau head office building on Herengracht 597–601, designed by Eduard Cuypers and completed in 1897, was demolished in 1966. A subsequent head office building [nl] on Rembrandtplein, designed by Bert Johan Ouëndag and completed in 1932, is a notable Art Deco landmark of Amsterdam.
