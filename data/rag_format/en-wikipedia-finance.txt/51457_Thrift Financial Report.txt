Thrift Financial Report


# Thrift Financial Report



All regulated financial institutions in the United States are required to file periodic financial and other information with their respective regulators and other parties. Thrifts are required by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), among other requirements, to file a key quarterly financial report called the **Thrift Financial Report** (**TFR**) to be filed electronically with the OTS. In 2007, there had been a proposal that thrifts convert to filing a similar report, the *Report of Condition and Income* commonly referred to as the Call Report, which banks prepare and file with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Since thrifts continue to file TFRs today, the proposal was dismissed or set aside for the time being.

Specifically, OTS regulation 12 CFR 563.180 requires the completion of the TFR by all savings associations as defined in 12 CFR 561.43. The TFR is filed electronically on a quarterly basis and is due no later than 30 days after quarter end, except for Schedule HC, Thrift Holding Company, and Schedule CMR, Consolidated Maturity and Rate, which are due no later than 45 days after quarter end.

The TFR contains 17 schedules, which include financial statements and supplemental information filed for the reporting savings association consolidated with its subsidiaries. Information on the TFR, including income and expense and cash flow data, is reported for the quarter, not year-to-date, with the exception of Schedule FS, Fiduciary and Related Services, in which fiduciary and related services income is reported for the calendar year-to-date. Most information on the TFR is available to the public for individual institutions; however, certain information is considered proprietary and is not released. All data are released in aggregate form. See this list of TFR schedules and their availability to the public. TFRs, and Call Reports filed are publicly available at the FDIC website; TFR schedules for an institution can be viewed (htm pages) or can be downloaded as text (.txt) files to be viewed or manipulated as desired with programs such as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word.

With the implementation of the Dodd Frank Act and the sunset of the OTS on July 21, 2011, all thrift institutions are required to submit Call Reports instead of TFR effective March 2012.
