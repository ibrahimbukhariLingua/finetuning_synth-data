In 2005 one of Ford's companies signed another major contract that quickly went awry. Vulcan Energy Solutions signed a $64 million contract with Iraq's minister for electricity, Aiham Alsammarae, to fix the Mulla Abdullah power plant in Kirkuk. An employee, J.C. Adams, was at the meeting and had worked on some of Vulcan's subcontracts in Iraq, and later testified that he was owed $150,000 in unpaid salary. Adams testified that he had been told he would finally be paid his salary if Vulcan won the Mulla Abdullah contract and that Ford Graham told a group of employees that he had agreed to include a $3 million “engineering fee” in the final contract as a bribe to get the contract.


## History

Vulcan Capital Management (not to be confused with Vulcan Inc. and its investment arm Vulcan Capital founded by Paul Allen) was founded in May 1997 by Ford Graham and Kevin Davis, and maintains principal offices in New York, NY, and Houston, TX. Since its founding in 1997, Vulcan has completed over 35 transactions worldwide, with a value exceeding $800 million through its family of partner funds and portfolio firms.

Ford Graham, 56, a 1986 alumnus of Princeton University, and his wife, Katherine Graham, 55, were arrested on Nov. 21 and remanded to the Bureau of Prisons and taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. Graham, a former Princeton resident accused in a lawsuit of running a $5 million Ponzi scheme, has been released from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan after spending more than two months there. Graham, together with his wife, Katherine, had been ordered jailed by federal judge Loretta A. Preska for failing to provide documents related to an earlier fraud case that dates back to 2003. The couple are being sued by Susan Flannigan, who worked for one of Ford Graham's companies, Vulcan Power Group. She successfully sued Graham for $2 million in unpaid commission and salary but has not collected the judgment. (U.S. 1, December 4, 2019.) Katherine Graham was released after six days, and on January 24, Preska ordered Ford Graham released under the conditions that he lives 100 miles or less from the courthouse in New York, comply with discovery demands, and help recover certain documents related to the case.
