The family moved to Haskell, Texas in the early 1900s, where Troy was born.


## Education and military service

During World War II he served in the military and after returning he formed a stock life insurance company, which is an insurance company owned by its shareholder's who elect a board of directors to conduct company business. Post's shrewd business acumen propelled the startup company to the forefront of the insurance business.


## Founder of Insurance Company

Post married, Maurine Shook (1906–1990), of Fort Worth, Texas, in 1926 at the age of 20, and fathered a son, Troy Victor Post, Jr., who was born in 1930. In 1930, the family moved to Dallas, Texas, where he got his first full-time job with the First National Bank of Fort Worth. Post had shown an interest in banking and insurance, after he obtained the First National Bank position, and at the age of 27, Post formed his own insurance company in his hometown of Haskell, Texas. Post started his company with his meager savings of US$130.00. Post and his first wife divorced in 1935, and he moved to Houston, Texas.

## Greatamerica Corporation

In 1962, Post formed Greatamerica Corporation, one of the nation's largest insurance conglomerates, that purchased controlling interest in Dallas based Braniff Airways, Inc., in 1964. Post was the principal shareholder of Greatamerica's stock and the company was headquartered on the top floor of Jim Ling's LTV Tower in downtown Dallas.

In 1964, Mr. and Mrs. Post gave Lovers Lane United Methodist Church three acres to complete a nearly 10-acre parcel that became the church's home on the northeast corner of Northwest Highway and Inwood Road.


## Braniff Airways, Inc.

On July 8, 1964, Greatamerica Corporation, one of the nation's largest life insurance and financial management companies, contracted to purchase the shares of Braniff's three largest shareholders that included a group of Dallas businessmen. The group, headed by J. Erik Jonsson, a cofounder and Mayor of the City of Dallas, had purchased a controlling interest in Braniff from former Texas Senator William A. Blakley. Senator Blakley, a close associate of Tom Braniff and developer of Exchange Park in Dallas, became the custodian of the Blakley-Braniff Foundation, after Mr. Braniff's death. The foundation owned all of Mr. and Mrs. Braniff's shares that they held in Braniff as a result of provisions in Mr. Braniff's Last Will and Testament.

Greatamerica purchased 57.5 percent of Braniff outstanding shares which gave the insurance giant controlling interest in the Dallas-based international airline by a wide margin. The company paid approximately US$41,000,000.00 for 1,665,000 shares of Braniff's stock. Greatamerica initially purchased 629,629 share of Braniff Airways Common Stock for the price of US$25.00 per share. The company was able to purchase an additional 1.1 million shares, which gave it controlling interest, for the same US$25.00 price per share.

On August 12, 1964, the Braniff Airways, Inc., board of directors elected Troy Victor Post as chairman of the board. Post was chairman and president of Greatamerica Corporation, who had purchased controlling interest in Braniff in July 1964. As a result of gaining controlling interest in Braniff Airways, he was elected to the Braniff board along with two other Greatmerica officers.


## Ling Temco Vought Buys Greatamerica

Dallas, based Ling Temco Vought, Inc, made tender offer to Greatamerica to purchase all of its stock on August 4, 1967. The acquisition was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board, on November 17, 1967, with stipulations that LTV greatly limit its business activities with Braniff International beyond ownership of the growing airline. At the time of the merger, Troy Post stepped down from the position of chairman of the board of Braniff Airways, Inc., and also relinquished his board position. Braniff president Harding L.
