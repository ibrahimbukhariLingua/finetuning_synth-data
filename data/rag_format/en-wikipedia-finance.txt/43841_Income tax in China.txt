Income tax in China


# Income tax in China



The **Individual Income Tax in China** (commonly abbreviated **IIT**) is administered on a progressive tax system with tax rates from 3 percent to 45 percent. As of 2019, China taxes individuals who reside in the country for more than 183 days on worldwide earned income. The system is separate from the income tax system of Hong Kong and Macau, which are administered independently.

The taxpayers of individual income tax include both resident taxpayers and non-resident taxpayers. A resident taxpayer who has the obligation to pay taxes in full must pay individual income tax on all income derived from sources within or outside China. The non-resident taxpayer shall pay individual income tax only on the income derived or sourced from China.

Individual income tax is a kind of income tax levied by the state on the income of citizens and individuals living in the country and the income derived from the country by individuals outside the country. In some countries, individual income tax is the main tax, accounting for a large proportion of fiscal revenue, and has a great impact on the economy.

A draft amendment to the individual income tax law is submitted to the third session of the 13th National People's Congress standing committee for deliberation on June 19, 2018. It is the seventh overhaul of the tax law since it was introduced in 1980. The draft decision of the NPC standing committee on amending the individual income tax law was submitted to the fifth session of the 13th NPC standing committee for deliberation on August 27, 2018. According to the draft decision, the basic standard for deducting expenses is to be set at 60,000 yuan per year, or 5,000 yuan per month, with the new tax rate range from 3% to 45% unchanged.

On August 31, 2018, the decision to revise the individual income tax law was passed, with the minimum threshold of 5,000 yuan per month and the latest threshold and tax rate implemented from Oct 1, 2018.


## Development history

During the period of the Republic of China, China used to levy income tax on salaries and interest on securities deposits.

In 1950, the executive principles for the implementation of the tax administration promulgated by the state council listed the types of taxes levied on individual income, which were then called "income tax on remuneration". However, due to the low level of productivity and per capita income, China implemented a low-wage system, and although taxes were set up, they were never levied.

On September 1, 1980, the third session of the fifth National People's Congress adopted and promulgated the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China. China's individual income tax system was thus established.

On September 10, 1980, the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China was adopted by the third session of the fifth National People's Congress.

After 1980, in order to adapt to China's policy of invigorating itself internally and opening up to the outside world, China formulated the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China, the provisional regulations of the People's Republic of China on income tax for urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households, and the provisional regulations of the People's Republic of China on individual income regulation tax. After the promulgation and implementation of the above three tax laws and regulations, they have played a positive role in adjusting personal income level, increasing national fiscal revenue, and promoting economic and technological cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries. However, some problems have also been exposed.

In September 1986, in response to the great changes in China's domestic personal income, the state council promulgated the "provisional regulations of the People's Republic of China on personal income regulatory tax", which stipulates the unified collection of personal income regulatory tax on the personal income of Chinese citizens.

To unified tax, fair tax burden, tax system, on October 31, 1993, the eighth session of the standing committee of the National People's Congress four conference passed the standing committee of the National People's Congress on amending ‘the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China’ decision ", on the same day issued a new modification of the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China "(hereinafter referred to as the tax law).

On January 28, 1994, the state council issued the regulations for the implementation of the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China.

On January 1, 2002, individual income tax income was divided between the central and local governments in proportion.

In July 2003, the institute of fiscal science of the ministry of finance of China released a report entitled "China's resident income distribution status and fiscal and tax adjustment policies", which proposed to reform the current individual income tax system, moderately increase the threshold of individual income tax, and adopt a low tax rate policy for middle-income groups.

On October 22, 2003, the ministry of commerce of the People's Republic of China proposed to abolish the collection of interest tax and increase the exemption amount of individual income tax.

On October 27, 2005, the 18th session of the standing committee of the 10th National People's Congress, the third amendment, voted through the NPC standing committee on the amendment of the individual income tax law decision, the exemption amount of 1600 yuan from January 1, 2006.

On December 29, 2007, the 31st session of the standing committee of the 10th National People's Congress, as amended in the fifth session, raised the exemption amount of individual income tax from 1600 yuan to 2000 yuan from March 1, 2008.

At the 21st meeting of the standing committee of the 11th National People's Congress on June 30, 2011, the sixth amendment was made. Subsequently, the state council issued the order No. 600, and the revised regulations for the implementation of the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China came into effect on September 1, 2011.

The fifth session of the standing committee of the 13th National People's Congress, which was amended for the seventh time, was held on Aug 31, 2018. The revision opens up the parallel mode of the comprehensive and classified taxation of individual income tax in China, which combines the income from wages and salaries, remuneration for labor services, remuneration for manuscripts and royalties into the comprehensive income for comprehensive declaration, and the deduction amount of individual income tax expense is adjusted to 5000 yuan. Subsequently, on December 22, 2018, the interim measures for special additional deduction of individual income tax issued by the state council [2018] No. 41 and the revised decree of the state council No. 707 were issued, together with the regulations for the implementation of the individual income tax law of the People's Republic of China.

In June 2018, China's National People's Congress (NPC), adopted an amendment to reform the ITT. The tax authorities had published draft implementing rules and amending measures for comment. Dwyer told China Briefing: "The changes are profound and will have an impact on expatriates as well as Chinese nationals. Mr. Dwyer also warned that expatriates and their employers should be vigilant: "The authorities are likely to strengthen their oversight of TII - especially for expatriate executives or companies employing large numbers of expatriates".

On 31 August 2018, the NPC passed the Draft Amendment to the People's Republic of China (PRC) IIT Law, and it takes its effects on 1 January 2019.
