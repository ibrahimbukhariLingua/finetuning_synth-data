# Coinslot



***Coinslot International*** is a UK trade magazine that caters for the 'pay-to-play' leisure sector, generally known as 'coin-op' before the widespread introduction of electronic means of payment. It is published weekly with a 'double' issue over the Christmas/New Year period.

*Coinslot* originated as a section of the ***World's Fair*** newspaper, published by the eponymous publishing house based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, before becoming a separate title. The magazine was first published in 1974.

## Ownership history

In 2000, the title was purchased by ATE Ltd, the organiser of the UK trade's major exhibition ATEI. In 1999 Coinslot, edited by Chris Murphy, successfully led the campaign against US-firm TOIC's proposals to purchase ATE from the industry's trade association BACTA (British Amusement Caterers Trade Association). Many in the industry believed that Coinslot played an instrumental part in blocking the sale of the exhibition company, which eventually purchased the newspaper. BACTA eventually sold ATE in June 2005 for £13.5m to Clarion Events, a deal that included Coinslot in the package. It was subsequently acquired by GB Media, which also publishes leading gaming titles iGaming Times and International Casino Review, for an undisclosed sum.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
