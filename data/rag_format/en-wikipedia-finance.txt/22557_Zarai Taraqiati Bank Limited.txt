## History

Zarai Taraqiati Bank's history goes back to 1952 when Agricultural Development Finance Corporation was founded under a Central Act for the purpose of expanding financial facilities and promoting the development and modernisation of Agriculture in Pakistan. In 1957, the Agricultural Bank of Pakistan was established and advanced both short and long-term loans. It commenced operations in January 1959 in East Pakistan and in April 1959 in West Pakistan, following exemptions from certain restrictive Provincial Debt Laws. Subsequently, the Agricultural Development Bank Ordinance was enacted on 18 February 1961. It facilitated the merger of the Agricultural Development Finance Corporation and the Agricultural Bank of Pakistan, based on recommendations from the Credit Enquiry Commission. By 1961, the bank operated 73 branches, divided between 38 in West Pakistan and 35 in East Pakistan.

On 14 December 2002, the Government of Pakistan renamed the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) as Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd (ZTBL). ZTBL was registered under the Companies Ordinance 1984, and all assets, liabilities, and proceedings of the former were transferred to and vested in the ZTBL with effect from 14 December 2002.
