Ministry of Foreign Trade (Costa Rica)


# Ministry of Foreign Trade (Costa Rica)



The **Ministry of Foreign Trade** (Spanish: *Ministerio de Comercio Exterior*, **COMEX**) is the government ministry of Costa Rica responsible for defining and directing the country's external trade and foreign investment policy, as well as handling non-contentious international administration and representing the Costa Rican state abroad in trade and investment matters.


## History

During the 2000s, the Ministry of Foreign Trade in Costa Rica operated without a formal legal framework, which posed a challenge in trade negotiations, as most countries already had a dedicated ministry, secretariat, or specialized department in place. There were three institutions tasked with managing different export incentive programs and promoting investments: the National Investment Council, the Center for the Promotion of Exports and Investments (CENPRO), and the Export Free Zone Corporation.

On December 29, 1995, during José María Figueres Olsen's government, 15 members of the National Liberation Party's parliamentary group presented a bill with the aim of creating the Ministry of Foreign Trade (COMEX) and the Costa Rican Foreign Trade Promoter (PROCOMER). They noted that in the previous years, foreign trade had been the main driver of Costa Rica's economy, but the legislation governing the institutional framework was outdated.

The initial bill formally established the Ministry of Foreign Trade and merged the Permanent Delegation of Costa Rica to the World Trade Organization with the trade representatives stationed in diplomatic delegations. Additionally, it gave rise to PROCOMER as the executing arm of the policies set forth by the ministry, bestowing upon it the status of a non-state public entity operating as a public limited company.

The proposal was referred to the Special State Reforms Commission, and it received unanimous approval on April 23, 1996. During the first reading, the bill garnered 38 votes in favor and 2 against, with the opposing votes coming from left-wing party deputies Gerardo Trejos Salas (Democratic Force) and Rodrigo Gutiérrez Schwanhauser (New Democratic Party). The second reading saw 36 votes in favor and 9 against.

The bill was sent to the Presidential House, where it received the signatures of both President José María Figueres Olsen and the Minister of Foreign Trade, José Rossi Umaña, becoming Law 7638 on October 30, 1996.
