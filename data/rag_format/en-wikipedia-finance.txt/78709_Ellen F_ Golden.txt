## Career

In 1978 Golden joined Coastal Enterprises, Inc.

She directed the CEI Women's Business Center, established with seed funding from the United States Small Business Administration, which offers "business counseling, training, and access to financing" for women entrepreneurs, and was managing director of CEI Investment Notes, which furnishes loans for small businesses.

In 1986 she received a $15,000 grant from the Maine Bureau of Vocational Education to survey women business owners across the state and evaluate their needs. This led to the establishment of a series of seminars for women in business the following year, with the participation of Maine's technical college system. The survey also led to the 2007 publication of *Telling Their Stories: Women Business Owners in Western Maine*, a 62-page pamphlet detailing the history of businesses started by women entrepreneurs in the state. In 2004 Golden was one of six women selected by Women Impacting Public Policy to query United States presidential candidate John Kerry on the subject of women in business during a national conference call heard by 2,000 female entrepreneurs.

Golden retired in December 2015 after 37 years at Coastal Enterprises.
