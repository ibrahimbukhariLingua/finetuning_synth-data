## Origins

The Ministry of Economy was not included as such in the first four Croatian Governments. The Cabinet of Stjepan Mesić and the Cabinet of Josip Manolić included the minister for social planning (Croatian: *društveno planiranje*; post held by Stjepan Zdunić) and the minister of energy and industry (Croatian: *energetika i industrija*; Božo Udovičić). In the Cabinet of Franjo Gregurić, the former minister became the minister of economic development (Croatian: *gospodarski razvitak*), and there was also a minister of trade (Croatian: *trgovina*; Petar Kriste, Branko Mikša). The Cabinet of Hrvoje Šarinić in turn included the minister of industry, shipbuilding and energy (Croatian: *industrija, brodogradnja i energetika*; Franjo Kajfež) and the minister of tourism and trade (Croatian: *turizam i trgovina*; Branko Mikša).

In the Cabinet of Zlatko Mateša, the prime minister also talked of renaming the ministry of economy back into the ministry of industry and energy. In the Cabinet of Andrej Plenković in October 2016 the Ministry of Economy was merged with the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Crafts into the Ministry of Economy, Small and Medium Entrepreneurship and Crafts.
