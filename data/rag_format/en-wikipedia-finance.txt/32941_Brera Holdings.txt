Brera Holdings completed the purchase of Mongolian football club Ilch FC in October 2023, expanding into Asia for the first time.

The following month, it was announced that minority stakeholder and Executive Chairman Daniel J. McClory became majority shareholder in the company with 54.5% ownership.
