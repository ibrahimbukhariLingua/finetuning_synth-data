## History

Since incorporation in 1996, HDIL has developed 23 projects covering approximately 19,290,000 square feet (1,792,000 m²) of saleable area, including approximately 12,730,000 square feet (1,183,000 m²) of land sold to other builders after Land Development, primarily in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. HDIL also have constructed an additional 1,900,000 square feet (180,000 m²) of rehabilitation housing area under slum rehabilitation schemes.

HDIL's residential projects generally comprise groups of apartments, towers or larger multi-purpose "township" projects in which individual housing units are sold to customers. The commercial projects are a mix of office space and multiplex cinemas. The retail projects focus on shopping malls. They usually follow a "build and sell" model for the properties they develop.

HDIL also undertakes slum rehabilitation projects under a Government scheme administered by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), whereby developers are granted development rights in exchange for clearing and redeveloping slum lands, including providing replacement housing for the dislocated slum dwellers.

Although historically HDIL has focused on real estate development in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, as part of their growth strategy they are considering projects in other locations, including Kochi and Hyderabad. They also are considering expanding into hotel projects, special economic zone(SEZ) developments and "mega-structure" complexes, which are large-scale mixed-use retail, commercial and residential developments.

In 2020, the Mumbai Police filed a case against the former bank management and promoters of HDIL in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank) case and said a special investigation team will be probing the case. The bank's former chairman Waryam Singh, managing director Joy Thomas and other senior officials, along with the director of HDIL, Wadhawan, have been named in the FIR. Explaining the modus operandi of the case, the FIR said HDIL promoters allegedly colluded with the bank management, to draw loans from the bank's Bhandup branch. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
