Public Eye on Davos


# Public Eye on Davos



The **Public Eye on Davos**, held every year between 2000 and 2015, was a counter-event to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The project involved non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from around the world and was coordinated by Swiss organizations Erklärung von Bern (EvB, renamed "Public Eye" in 2016) and Greenpeace Switzerland. The Public Eye is a platform for substantial criticism of "purely profit-oriented globalization". The focus of the Public Eye Awards since 2005 has been on corporate social responsibility. In 2009, the Positive category was for the first time awarded for a courageous employee for his or her exemplary contributions.


## History

The Public Eye was first held in the year 2000 to accompany the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos critically. Together with the newspaper WOZ, they organized an event under the name ″Who rules the world″ and organized a public discussion with the president of the WEF, Klaus Schwab. In the following year, the Public Eye was extended to a multiple day counter-conference with 20 participants from NGOs and critical scientists. They also followed the WEF to New York in 2002, where the President of the Swiss Confederation, Kaspar Villiger, opened the conference.

In 2005, they introduced the Public Eye Awards as a renewal of the event, which was in future the main event of the Public Eye on Davos. In 2007, after Pro Natura stopped working on the event because the use of the event was too one-sited on the organizers of the WEF, Greenpeace was beside Erklärung von Bern the new organizing partner of the event. The Public Eye celebrated its ten-year anniversary on 28 January 2009. In 2015, Davos was for the last time the venue of the Public Eye Award with Chevron Corporation as winner of the lifetime award.
