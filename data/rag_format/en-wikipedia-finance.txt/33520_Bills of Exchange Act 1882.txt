# Bills of Exchange Act 1882



The **Bills of Exchange Act 1882** (45 & 46 Vict. c. 61) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that codified the law relating to bills of exchange. Bills of exchange are widely used to finance trade and, when discounted with a financial institution, to obtain credit.

The act was drafted by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers, who later drafted the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (56 & 57 Vict. c. 71) and the Marine Insurance Act 1906 (8 Edw. 7. c. 41).

## Provisions

Section 3 of the act provided a formal definition of a bill of exchange:

> An unconditional order in writing addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time a sum certain in money to order or to bearer.

Expressing this in less formal language, it is a written order from one party (the drawer) to another (the drawee) to pay a specified sum on demand or on a specified date to the drawer or to a third party specified by the drawer.

Section 3 of the act also required that bills of exchange be written and signed in order to be enforceable.
