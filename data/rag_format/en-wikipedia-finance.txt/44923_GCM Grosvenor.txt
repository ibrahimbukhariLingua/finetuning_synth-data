## History

GCM Grosvenor was founded in 1971 by Richard Elden and managed the first fund of hedge funds in the United States. In 1973, Elden brought on a partner, Frank Meyer, who had been a colleague at A.G. Becker. Elden left GCM Grosvenor in 2006 to start Lakeview Investment Manager, which runs an activist fund of hedge funds, and Meyer retired from the business. Michael Sacks, who joined the firm in 1990, is the current Chairman and chief executive officer of the company.

In January 2014, GCM Grosvenor completed its acquisition of the Customized Fund Investment Group (CFIG) from Credit Suisse Group AG. CFIG was Credit Suisse's third-party private equity business, investing some $20 billion with outside private equity managers.

In August 2020, GCM Grosvenor announced it will become a public company through a merger with CF Finance Acquisition Corp. (“CFAC”) (NASDAQ: CFFA), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading global financial services firm. GCM Grosvenor began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker “GCMG” on November 18, 2020.
