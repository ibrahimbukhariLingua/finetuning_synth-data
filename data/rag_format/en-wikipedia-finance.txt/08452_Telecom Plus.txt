# Telecom Plus



**Telecom Plus plc** is a British multi-utility supplier of gas, electricity, home insurance, and landline, broadband and mobile services to residences and businesses. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.


## History

The company was founded in 1996 as a telecommunications business. Its first product, launched in 1997, was a least cost call routing 'Smart Box', a gadget that plugs into a phone socket and routes the calls to alternative networks at a cheaper rate than British Telecom.

In 2017 the company sold its 20% stake in Opus Energy to Drax Group.

In October 2023, the company had over 949,000 customers.


## Key people

Andrew Lindsay, a world-class rower who was a member of the gold medallist British team at the 2000 Olympics, joined Telecom Plus in 2007. He was the chief operating officer in 2009 and was promoted to chief executive officer in July 2010. Lindsay held the CEO role jointly with Stuart Burnett from 2021, and in 2023 the company announced that Lindsay would step down at the 2024 AGM.


## Operations

The company has two subsidiaries:

* Utility Warehouse (branded as UW) operates a landline telephony service, mobile telephony (as an MVNO on the EE network), supplies broadband, gas and electricity and offers home insurance. UW also offers a pre-paid debit card which pays a "cashback" percentage on purchases (given as a credit against the monthly bill for other UW services) in return for a monthly fee. The cards are operated by Mastercard and issued by PSI-Pay Ltd, a privately-held company.
* Telecommunications Management Limited provides a landline telephony service to small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) customers, as well as operating the **1pMobile** consumer MVNO.
