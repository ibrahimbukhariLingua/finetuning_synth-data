## Commercializing Forestation in Iran

Inspired by the Chinese method of using genetically modified trees in fighting desertification and commercial afforestation, he began a campaign to improve Iran's pollution, deforestation and green city planning problem using commercial forestation with the genetically modified Paulownia tree.

The effort would be supported by a series of greenhouses which replicated genetically modified trees in a dozen locations across Iran. During this campaign Aras Green Economic Dawn (Persian: عصر اقتصاد سبز ارس), was established to manage the commercialization of forestation in Iran and cut down on the import of paper into the country which amounted to a billion dollar industry in 2013.

The campaign had many setbacks in areas outside of Tehran, but succeeded in making artificial forests commercially viable in Iran. By utilizing modified trees he pushed a countrywide project for commercial forestation.
