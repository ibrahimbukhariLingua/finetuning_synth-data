## Controversies


### Opposition to Carmichael mine

The Carmichael coal mine project has faced environmental protests across Australia since the mine was proposed in 2010. The pressure from environmental groups forced international banks and financial institutions to not lend to the project, and resulted in a long delay in securing environmental clearances. In 2018, Adani Group scaled down the mine's capacity and self-financed the project. An indigenous group of the region went to court seeking invalidation of the indigenous land use agreement which was approved by its representatives, but the appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court in 2019. The mine made its first coal shipment in December 2021.


### Allegations of stock manipulation

Hindenburg also disclosed that it was holding short positions on Adani Group companies. Bonds and shares of companies associated with Adani experienced a decline in value after the accusations. Adani denied the fraud allegations as unfounded and ill-intentioned. On 26 January 2023, Adani Group expressed its intention of taking legal action against Hindenburg.
