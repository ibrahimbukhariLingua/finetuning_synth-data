# Cherokee Nation Businesses



**Cherokee Nation Businesses, LLC (CNB)** is an American conglomerate holding company headquartered in Catoosa, Oklahoma that oversees and manages several subsidiary companies. CNB is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cherokee Nation, the largest Native American tribe by population in the United States. CNB operates in the following industries: aerospace and defense, hospitality and entertainment, environmental and construction services, information technology, healthcare, and security and safety.


## History

Cherokee Nation Businesses was established on June 16, 2004. CNB is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cherokee Nation. The tribe exerts control over the operations of CNB through the Board of Directors. Upon its establishment, CNB became responsible for providing "strategic direction" to all Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma-owned businesses, to diversify the Cherokee Nation business holdings, and to act as a holding company for some Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma business investments. CNB receives revenues from its subsidiaries in order to fund the expansion of existing firms and the acquisition of new ones. CNB was established to diversify the business interests of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. At its establishment, pursuant to the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma *Corporation Reform Act of 2002*, 25% of all CNB profits were to be reinvested with the Tribal Government as dividend payment.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Cherokee Nation *Jobs Growth Act of 2005*, CNB became the holding company for all business enterprises, including Cherokee Nation Entertainment (CNE) and Cherokee Nation Industries (CNI). CNE was transferred to CNB ownership in 2006 and CNI was transferred in 2008. Prior to these transfers ownership of CNE and CNI were held directly by the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. At its establishment, CNB was governed by its own board with both CNE and CNI governed by separate boards of their own. In 2010, the separate boards were dissolved and consolidated into a single CNB board. The same year, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma enacted the *Dividend Act of 2005*, which increased CNB's annual dividend payment to the Tribal Government from 25% to 30% of a total profits.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

CNB established its Environmental and Construction Division in March 2005 with the establishment of Cherokee CRC. The Division provides environmental consulting, construction engineering and management services, environmental remediation services, and scientific research and development (including laboratory testing) for government agencies as well as for chemical, oil and gas, manufacturing and waste companies. The Division was expanded in 2008 with the establishment of *Cherokee Nation Construction Services'* to offer construction management services. In February 2010, CNB announced the closure of CNB Manufacturing Division's construction unit due to constant financial problems. The unit's assets were moved from CNB's Manufacturing Division into its Environmental Division. The CNB Manufacturing Division's defense contracting mission was expanded in August 2008 with the acquisition of Alabama-based *Aerospace S.E., Inc.*, which provides aerospace product distribution and supply chain services for the United States Department of Defense.

In August 2010, in order to implement the provisions of the Jobs Growth Act of 2005, CNB consolidated its various internal support and administrative service operations into a single structure located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The new office complex houses several of CNB's operating divisions as well as CNB-wide corporate support staff offices. CNB's Manufacturing Division remained headquartered in Stilwell, Oklahoma, with CNB's gaming operations and corporate headquarters remaining centered in Catoosa, Oklahoma.

CNB established its Security and Defense Division in July 2010. The Division provides security services, including property surveillance and guard services. Additionally, through the acquisition of Kellyville, Oklahoma-based *Cherokee Nation Red Wing*, the Division serves as a defense contractor by manufacturing and assembling electronic parts for the United States Department of Defense and the aerospace industry. In July 2012, the Manufacturing and Distribution Division's telecommunications group expanded with the acquisition of a 143,000-square foot building at the MidAmerica Industrial Park in Pryor, Oklahoma, establishing the **CNB Distribution Center** in the process.

CNB completed the acquisition of *Mobility Plus*, a Muskogee, Oklahoma-based supplier of health care equipment, in November 2011, expanding CNB's Healthcare Division in the process. That same month, CNB purchased expanded its Technology Division through the purchase of two Colorado-based companies: *ETI Professionals Inc.* (which was renamed *Cherokee Nation Government Solutions*) which offers strategic technology project management and staffing solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ, and *ITX Inc.* (which was consolidated into *Cherokee Services Group*) which provides full-service computer and information technology services to United States federal government and commercial entities.

In November 2011, at the request of Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma Bill John Baker, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma enacted the *Corporate Health Dividend Act of 2011*, which increased CNB's annual dividend payment to the Tribal Government from 30% to 35% of a total profits. The 5% is earmarked to support the provision of healthcare services to Cherokee citizens. In March 2012, CNB sold its corporate airplane at the request of Chief Baker. Baker had promised the sale of the plane as part of his 2011 election campaign. The proceeds of the sale (approximately $1.5 million) was given to the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma to supplement its funding of healthcare services for Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma members.

CNB purchased a 298,000 square foot building in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, in November 2012 in order to allow for future expansion of its manufacturing operations.


## Corporate affairs

The Cherokee Nation Principal Chief, with the approval of the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council, appoints all members of the Board of Directors of CNB. The current Chairman of the Board is Sam Hart, having served in that position since February 14, 2012.

The current chief executive officer of CNB, Chuck Garrett, has been CEO since August 2019, replacing Shawn Slaton, who had served as CEO since 2011.
Garrett is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma and Harvard Law School. A native of Muskogee, with family ties in Adair County, and a Cherokee Nation citizen, Garrett worked in real estate investment, asset management and investment banking prior to returning to Oklahoma to join CNB in 2013.

For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, Cherokee Nation Businesses reported a net income of $91.5 million on $653.5 million of revenue (a 14% profit margin).
