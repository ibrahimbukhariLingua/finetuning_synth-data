## History


### Founding

The company was founded in 1924 under the name of Fiducia Accounting and Auditing Institute AG in Karlsruhe. The name “Fiducia” is Latin, meaning trust, reliability and assurance. In 1958 Fiducia came to the supervised banks with the idea of a merger into a reservation community. Fiducia took over the organization as a new business. During the following years, mainly punched cards were used. Over the course of the 1960s, a gradual transition took place to other media, such as journal strips, magnetic tapes and magnetic disks.


### Fiducia online system

In the 1970s, Fiducia began to establish subsidiaries and participating interests in other companies, to serve the expanded customer base with industry-specific solutions and services. The Fiducia online method for interactive traffic was launched.


### ATMs in dialog system

In the 1980s Fiducia supported automation of payments by installing ATMs in the dialogue system, started the development of a banking application procedure. The firm merged with the cooperative information center GIC, Mutterstadt, Information Center for Fiducia AG and inclusion of the reservation community Saar eG, Saarbrücken.


### Agree bank workplace

After a further merger in 1999 with the GRK BG data center Kassel GmbH, and the RWG Rechenzentrale Wurttembergischer cooperatives GmbH, Stuttgart in 2001, Fiducia AG Karlsruhe / Stuttgart developed the Fiducia banking procedures together with the rbg Rechenzentrale Bavarian cooperatives eG. This bank method was based on the previous system NBS Fiducia, and united the parallel banking systems Rubin (GRK), GEBOS (CT) and GENOS (rbg) acquired from the many mergers. Therefore, it was called *Agree* (from the English word) and was released in 2003 for the first time in version 1.0. In the same year, the merger between Fiducia IT AG and rbg took place.


### Other banks

In the following years, an increasing number of private banks joined the cooperative banks. According to market research firm Gartner in 2004, Fiducia developed into the seventh-largest IT service provider in Germany. In 2006 the PSD Bank made a decision to gradually migrate from Sparda (SDV) to agree, which happened by July 2008. In the same year, Fiducia introduced the mobileTAN procedure (mTAN). The locations of Kassel, Erfurt, Saarbrücken, and Nuremberg were closed.


### Completion of migrations

Since 25 June 2007, all of the Fiducia IT AG supervised banks had migrated to the agree system. On 25 August, Fiducia put a newly designed IT center into operation, which met the guidelines of BS7799 and ISO17799. In September Fiducia received the Silver Safety Award from Baden-Württemberg for "outstanding projects of occupational safety". This was awarded for the Security Awareness campaign with the name of "Security Cup 2007".

On 21 February 2008, Fiducia put their new data center in Rheinstetten near Karlsruhe into operation. As of March 17, 2008, the first 15 banks of PSD (PSD Bank Nord eG) were successfully migrated to agree and were using the Fiducia eBanking system.


### Merger with GAD eG

In early 2006, exploratory talks began with the IT service provider GAD eG about a possible merger, which failed. Subsequently, in January 2008, a merger in 2010 was promised.

With massive pressure from the owners of both companies and with the objective of saving costs, merger talks began again in September 2011. The Federal Cartel Office approval of the merger was announced in late May 2012, however, talks ended in July 2012 due to differences in company valuation. Fresh talks began at the end of 2013, resulting in the successful merger in 2015.
