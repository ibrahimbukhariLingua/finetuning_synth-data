## History

Liberty House was founded by Sanjeev Gupta in 1992, when he was a student at Cambridge University.

In 2013, Liberty House Group was a surprise buyer for a steel mill in Newport, South Wales, Mir Steel UK, that had got into financial difficulties. Companies owned by Gupta and his family went on to make further acquisitions in the UK. Together with the SIMEC Group, part of the GFG Alliance, Liberty purchased the Lochaber aluminium smelter plant as well as the Laggan Dam from Rio Tinto in November 2016. In February 2017, LHG agreed to purchase the specialty steel division of Tata Steel Europe for £100 million. The purchase included the division's facilities in Rotherham, Stocksbridge, and Brinsworth in South Yorkshire and Wednesbury in the West Midlands.

In July 2017, LHG purchased South Australian steelmaker and iron ore miner Arrium, which owned Whyalla Steelworks but had entered voluntary administration in April 2016. The company was rebadged LibertyOneSteel for the first year of ownership, later being renamed Liberty Steel.

In October 2019, GFG Alliance promised to merge its steel assets into Liberty Steel Group by year end.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

In 2020, LHG received European Union approval to purchase the plant of aluminium smelter operator Aleris in Duffel, Belgium, which cleared the way for the purchase of Aleris by Novelis.

On 19 February 2021 ThyssenKrupp ended discussions with Liberty Steel, which had proposed to take over the former's steel unit. ThyssenKrupp had sought €1.5 billion for its steel assets but, given ThyssenKrupp's €960 million EBIT loss in 2020, Liberty had sought to acquire the unit for a reverse payment.

On 31 March 2021 Credit Suisse filed insolvency proceedings against Liberty Commodities (a LHG subsidiary) in a London court. The action was brought by a unit of another bank, Citigroup, which was acting under instruction from Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse were on the hook for a $10 billion fund, part of which was invested in Greensill Capital which had placed $3.6 billion in LHG parent company GFG, part of which had funnelled down to LCL. The balance sheet of Credit Suisse would absorb significant damage as a result.ᶠᵘʳᵗʰᵉʳ ᵉˣᵖˡᵃⁿᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 2 April 2021, Gupta claimed that none of its plants would close under his watch, as he tried to refinance his business after the collapse of financial backer Greensill. Liberty Steel had 3,000 employees, while GFG Alliance had another 2,000 in other UK metals and engineering businesses. In April 2021, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Kwasi Kwarteng rejected a request to bail LSG out. In February 2022, HM Revenue & Customs sought winding-up petitions against four LSG subsidiaries.

In November 2024, Liberty Steel initiated a restructuring plan for its UK-based Speciality Steel division (SSUK) in a bid to reduce its significant debt load. Despite potential impacts on creditors, it was reported that the plan would not affect the 1,500 employees of SSUK.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ
