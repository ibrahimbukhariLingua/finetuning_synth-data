Hospitality industry in New Zealand


# Hospitality industry in New Zealand



The **hospitality industry in New Zealand** is a major industry operating around the country. It is one of the largest employment sectors in the country, contributing about 1.7% of GDP, equivalent to NZ$5 billion annually.

Businesses in the sector can be divided into four broad categories: Quick Service Restaurants; Takeaways; Pubs, Taverns and Bars; and Cafes and Restaurants. More than half of the sector's workforce work in cafes and restaurants, and more than half of sales occur in the Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington regions.

The sector has a long-term shortage of workers, particularly skilled chefs and managers. Workers do not require formal qualifications, but require customer service skills and may require certificates to manage premises and sell alcohol. The shortage of workers has been made worse due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


## History

In 2019, 39.1% of sales were in the Auckland region, 12.3% of sales were in the Canterbury region, and 10.6% of sales were in the Wellington region.

Between January 2020 and January 2021, the sector recorded double digit revenue declines across all categories due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. Spending on businesses including cafes, restaurants, takeaway food, and bars was 95% lower in April 2020 than in April 2019.

In the late 2021 Auckland lockdown, the sector recorded a further 60% reduction in national activity.
