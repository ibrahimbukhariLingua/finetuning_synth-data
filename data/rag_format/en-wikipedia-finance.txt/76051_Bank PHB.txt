## Bank PHB Group

Bank PHB was a member of the Bank PHB Group, headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, with subsidiaries in the Gambia, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Uganda.


## History

Bank PHB was formed in 2005 by the merger between **Platinum Bank Plc** and **Habib Nigeria Bank Plc**. Since its inception, the bank pursued a strategy of expansion by the acquisition and creation of subsidiaries within and without its home country of Nigeria. (See Bank PHB Group).


## Failure and closure

On August 5, 2011, the Central Bank of Nigeria revoked the operating licence of BankPHB along with that of Afribank and Spring Bank as they had not shown capacity and ability to recapitalize before the September 30, 2011 recapitalization deadline.

Keystone Bank Limited was created on August 5, 2011, by taking over all the assets (including subsidiaries) and liabilities of the now defunct BankPHB, whose commercial banking license had been revoked on the same day.
