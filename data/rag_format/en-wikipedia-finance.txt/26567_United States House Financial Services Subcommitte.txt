## Members, 112th Congress

In December 2010, *Bloomberg Businessweek* reported that incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner was considering ways to prevent Ron Paul, who has long been a critic of Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve System, from becoming chair of the subcommittee or restrict his authority. Paul has stated that he will use the position to draw attention to the Fed's policies and what he perceives to be its negative consequences.
