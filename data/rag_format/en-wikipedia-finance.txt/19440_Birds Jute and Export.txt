On 10 October 2018, the Union Cabinet convened in a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During this meeting, a decision was made to initiate the closure of the financially struggling National Jute Manufactures Corporation Limited (NJMC), including its subsidiary, Birds Jute and Exporters Ltd.
