United Artists Releasing


# United Artists Releasing



**United Artists Releasing, LLC** (**UAR**) was an American film distribution joint venture between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Annapurna Pictures and the successor to United Artists (UA) that operated from October 31, 2017 to March 4, 2023.

Founded by former MGM CEO Gary Barber and Annapurna founder Megan Ellison on October 31, 2017, it operated within the offices of the headquarters of the respective companies in West Hollywood and Los Angeles in California and offered alternative services to the major film studios and streaming media companies with 10â€“14 films released annually. The venture rebranded as **United Artists Releasing** on February 5, 2019, to commemorate 100 years since the founding of United Artists.

On May 26, 2021, online shopping and technology company Amazon acquired MGM Holdings, the former parent company of MGM, for $8.45 billion which closed on March 17, 2022, and consequentially placed UAR under the control of Amazon Studios. Amazon then folded United Artists Releasing into MGM on March 4, 2023, in a push towards cinematic/theatrical film distribution alongside their staple media releases on their video on demand service Amazon Prime Video.


## History

American media companies Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures (MGM) and Annapurna Pictures announced the formation of a local film distribution joint-venture and a film releasing entity under the name Mirror to release third-party films in cinemas/theaters. This marked the return of MGM to domestic distribution 7 years after its closure following the 2010 bankruptcy and subsequent reorganization, in which approximately 6 to 8 films would be released commencing on March 2, 2018 with the release of *Death Wish*.

The initial staff of the joint venture composed of those of Annapurna's own distribution division. By January 31, 2019, the venture released eight titles in total, none of which were released under the touted *Mirror Releasing* banner.

The joint venture took on a name on February 5, 2019, **United Artists Releasing**, in commemoration of a century (100 years) of the creation of the original United Artists, with the rationale being to "better compete against the major studios, especially with respect to their tentpole films that dictate the release calendar".

Former Screen Gems executive Pam Kunath was appointed to be its chief operating officer and one of MGM's subsidiaries, Orion Pictures, added its films and staff from its distribution division to the venture. A board of directors consisting of executives from the partner companies was created to oversee the three UAR executives; Kunath, David Kaminow and president of Annapurna's distribution and marketing, Erik Lomis.

The inaugural film release post-rebrand was the 2019 stop-motion animated film *Missing Link*, which won the company its inaugural and only Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film.

On October 7, 2020, MGM revived the American International Pictures label for the digital and limited theatrical release of acquired films with UAR to local theaters, beginning with the 2021 film *Breaking News in Yuba County*.

On May 11, 2021, online shopping and technology company Amazon entered negotiations to acquire MGM's former parent company, MGM Holdings, principally green-lighted by MGM board chairman Kevin Ulrich whose company, Anchorage Capital Group, is a major MGM shareholder. A week later, the proposed acquisition by Amazon was officially announced, pending local and global regulatory approvals, for $8.45 billion and completed on March 17, 2022. Later that same day, Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Amazon Studios and Amazon Prime Video, emphasized at a town hall meeting that his company will continue to partner with its new division United Artists Releasing, which will remain in operation post-acquisition.

On March 4, 2023, *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed that Amazon folded UAR into MGM due to Amazon's optimism of the feasibility of theatrical distribution. The announcement was on the same day *Creed III* was released, which is also the first film distributed by MGM itself under Amazon's ownership.
