Specially designed conditions, such as regulation in accordance with the highest international standards, a robust financial infrastructure, an autonomous judicial system, and an emphasis on innovation and expertise, are employed to enable businesses to attract capital.


## History

Nursultan Nazarbayev announced the “100 Concrete Steps” Plan of the Nation to implement the five institutional reforms, designed to provide a strong national platform needed to achieve country's ambition of joining the top 30 developed countries by 2050. As part of the Plan of the Nation, the AIFC was established with a special legal status to be based on the EXPO-2017 International Specialized Exhibition infrastructure.

The Astana International Financial Centre is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative's financial infrastructure.¹⁵⁴ It increases financial connectivity among Central Asia, China, Russia, and the Arab world.

As of August 2024, over 3 000 companies are registered with AIFC, reaching a historical maximum of over 600 new registrations in 2023 alone, including leading financial firms, global service providers, cryptocurrency exchanges, venture capital companies and regional development banks. Prominent firms such as KPMG, EY, PwC, Deloitte, Binance, Bybit, Most Ventures, Amicorp, China Construction Bank Corporation, and China Development Bank are part of the AIFC’s ecosystem.

AIFC has steadily emerged as a significant platform, not only for Kazakhstan but for the entire Central Asian region, establishing itself as a dynamic hub for finance and investment. In particular, as of the latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) 35, the AIFC ranked first in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, solidifying its position as a leading financial centre in the region. Additionally, topping the region in the Global Green Finance Index (GGFI) 12 showcases our commitment to sustainable finance and environmental responsibility.
