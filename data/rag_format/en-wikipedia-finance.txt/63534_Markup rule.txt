Markup rule


# Markup rule



A **markup rule** is the pricing practice of a producer with market power, where a firm charges a fixed mark-up over its marginal cost.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Derivation of the markup rule

Mathematically, the markup rule can be derived for a firm with price-setting power by maximizing the following expression for profit:

Profit maximization means that the derivative of {\displaystyle \pi } with respect to Q is set equal to 0:

This yields:

or "marginal revenue" = "marginal cost".

By definition {\displaystyle P'(Q)\cdot Q/P} is the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand (or {\displaystyle 1/\epsilon }). Hence

Letting {\displaystyle \eta } be the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand,

Thus a firm with market power chooses the output quantity at which the corresponding price satisfies this rule. Since for a price-setting firm {\displaystyle \eta <0} this means that a firm with market power will charge a price above marginal cost and thus earn a monopoly rent. On the other hand, a competitive firm by definition faces a perfectly elastic demand; hence it has {\displaystyle \eta =0} which means that it sets the quantity such that marginal cost equals the price.

The rule also implies that, absent menu costs, a firm with market power will never choose a point on the inelastic portion of its demand curve (where {\displaystyle \epsilon \geq -1} and {\displaystyle \eta \leq -1}). Intuitively, this is because starting from such a point, a reduction in quantity and the associated increase in price along the demand curve would yield both an increase in revenues (because demand is inelastic at the starting point) and a decrease in costs (because output has decreased); thus the original point was not profit-maximizing.
