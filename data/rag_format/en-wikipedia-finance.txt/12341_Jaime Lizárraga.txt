### Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

President Joe Biden nominated Lizárraga to replace Democrat Allison Lee as a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 2022. He was confirmed by the United States Senate in June 2022. He was sworn into office on July 18, 2022.

Following the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Lizárraga indicated in a speech that he agreed with SEC chair Gary Gensler's view that most crypto tokens should be regulated as securities. He argued that the "problems in the digital asset market are worse than those in the traditional finance system, because they occur in a largely unregulated space".

Lizárraga resigned from the SEC in January 2025.
