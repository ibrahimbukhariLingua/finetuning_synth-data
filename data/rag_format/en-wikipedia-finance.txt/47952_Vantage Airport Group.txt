# Vantage Airport Group



**Vantage Group** (or **Vantage**, formerly known as **Vantage Airport Group**, and/or **Vancouver Airport Services** or **YVRAS**) is an airport management, development and investment company with 13 airports in Canada, the United States, Cyprus, The Bahamas and Jamaica.


## History

Vantage Group (Vantage), formerly known as Vantage Airport Group, was formed in 1994 as Vancouver Airport Services (YVRAS), a subsidiary of Vancouver Airport Authority. Vancouver Airport Authority and Vantage Group have a strategic partnership agreement that allows for the sharing of best practices and expertise. YVRAS was part of a consortium that was going to privatize Midway Airport in Chicago. In April 2009 the deal fell through.

Vantage led the LaGuardia Gateway Partners consortium bid to operate and redevelop LaGuardia Airport's Terminal B. On May 28, 2015, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted to move forward on the Central Terminal Building Redevelopment Project, announcing LaGuardia Gateway Partners as preferred proposer.

On June 1, 2016, LaGuardia Gateway Partners assumed the lease of Terminal B, commencing a $5.1B terminal redevelopment plan, the largest aviation infrastructure P3 in the U.S.

In March 2018, Vantage and RXR Realty were selected by JetBlue Airways as the preferred development partner for the airline's terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).

Vantage is wholly owned by Corsair Capital Infrastructure Partners. On February 4, 2019, Corsair announced the closing of a fundraising initiative for Vantage.

JetBlue Technology Ventures announced on April 25, 2019 that Vantage had joined its International Partnership Program to scout new startups and technologies to improve the travel experience.
