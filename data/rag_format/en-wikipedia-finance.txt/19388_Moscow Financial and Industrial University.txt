Since 2023, the university has been the largest in Russia in terms of the number of students.


## History

The university's roots can be traced back to 1995, when Y.B. Rubin, a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Education, founded the Moscow Higher School of Banking. The same institution was later rebranded to the Moscow International Institute of Econometrics, Informatics, Finance and Law (MIEEIFP) in 1998, and by 2000, it had nearly 8,000 students enrolled.

Since 2001, AMBA has accredited the Master's programs of the university's Business School six times; the most recent was in 2016. Since 2003, the university has been a member of the European Foundation for Management Development, known as «Sinerghia» in English.

The MMIEIFP was converted into the Moscow Financial and Industrial Academy in 2005. Approximately 15 thousand students enrolled in the university every year since 2005. The Moscow Financial and Industrial Academy received the first E-Learning Quality Assurance accreditation granted to a Russian university in 2009. In 2010–2011, a yearly average of 20,000 individuals enrolled at the Moscow Financial and Industrial Academy which, in 2011, was recognized as a university after receiving state certification and renamed as the Moscow Financial and Industrial University Synergy.

From 2013 to 2017, Synergy University actively absorbed small universities in the regions that lost their licenses and grew intensively. The university actively promoted the transfer of students from other universities, including those who lost their accreditation.

In 2016, students of the Arkhangelsk Institute of Management, deprived of a license, received mass messages offering to continue their studies at Synergy through social networks. One of the heads of a large university that had claims from Rosobrnadzor told about the employees of Synergy: "They traveled to the regions, offered money to the directors so that they could persuade students who could stay on the street to switch to Synergy.

By 2017, the total number of students at MFPU Synergy exceeded 50,000. MFPU Synergy was one of the pioneering universities in Russia to introduce the «Startup as a Diploma» programme in 2017. Under the programme, students defend their diploma thesis by presenting a business project that has been formalized as a functional legal entity. The project can be carried out individually or in a group by the students.

The university was the first in Russia to open the Faculty of Internet Professions in 2017. This faculty provides training for computer game development, application and software development, programming, game design, cybersports, and targetologists. Synergy University also established the Faculty of Theatre, Film, and Television in the same year.

In 2019, MFPU participated in the national project «Small and medium-sized entrepreneurship and support of individual entrepreneurial initiative». The university won the competition organized by the Ministry of Economic Development and was awarded a grant of over 1 billion rubles to promote entrepreneurship and develop programs.

## Protection of reputation in court

**The university's lawsuit against the publication "Novaya Gubernia"**

In 2022, IFPU "Synergy" brought to justice the online publication "Novaya Gubernia" for spreading false information discrediting the business reputation. As it was established by the court, in 2021, in the publication "Where to go to study and how much does higher education cost today?" the publication published untrue information and, in accordance with the court's decision, published a refutation.

An article with information discrediting the reputation of the university was posted almost unchanged on their websites by 4 more electronic media, referring to the original source. According to the publication Days.The placement of identical materials in several publications at once is one of the signs that the articles are of a custom nature and often represent the so—called "black PR", and the Federal Press publication suggested unfair competitors who initiated these publications. After the court's decision on the university's claim, all 4 publications that hosted the article "Novaya Gubernia" deleted it.

The court found a number of phrases and statements to be untrue and defamatory, for example, the statement "In 2015, Synergy University and its top management were accused of raiding the Vladimir Institute of Business. The raider seizure of the only private university in Vladimir happened when its rector was on a business trip." Earlier, The Insider also reported on the "raider seizure" of the Vladimir Institute of Business. But, as it turned out in court, the owner of this institute has been Synergy University since 1995, which was confirmed by an extract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities (USRLE).

The court also found the statement to be untrue: "In the summer of 2019, the work of this university was suspended, and the university's current accounts were blocked by the tax inspectorate. Such actions of the tax authority indicate the financial insolvency of the educational institution." The Bell newspaper wrote about the alleged blocking of university accounts some time ago. As it was established by the court, the university's accounts have never been blocked, and the university itself has a stable financial position. These facts were confirmed by the Federal Tax Service in response to a corresponding request, as the defendant also writes in the refutation.

The court found the statement "Synergy is famous for its very low quality of education — the university is trailing the entire educational system of the country" to be defamatory and untrue. The court found that Synergy University in 2021 ranked 58th in the uniRank Top Universities in Russia-2021 ranking, and is included in the international university ranking QS EECA University Rankings, where 117 out of 750 Russian universities are represented, which refutes the claim of low quality of education.

**The university's lawsuit against blogger Alexander Yasyutin**

In 2021, the Vologda City Court considered the claim of Synergy University against blogger Alexander Yasyutin, who was previously convicted of possession of narcotic substances on a large scale, and found that on his YouTube video hosting channel he distributed defamatory and untrue information about the rules of admission to the university, the quality of education, retaking exams, and the cost of participating in events "Synergy" and the lack of useful information on them. The blogger's statements that there is a certain computer program at the university that influences students' passing exams through the choice of arbitrary answers also did not find their confirmation in court: Yasyutin could not provide evidence for his words.

The Vologda Online edition suggested that Yasyutin acted out of selfish motives. The university did not make any material claims against the blogger. The court ordered the blogger to post a rebuttal, delete the content and pay a state fee.

**Pre-trial claim against blogger Alexander Gorbunov**

In 2020, Synergy University sent a pre-trial claim to wheelchair user and blogger Alexander Gorbunov demanding the removal of two videos from Gorbunov's YouTube channel. In the videos that the university demanded to be deleted, the blogger said that the university had previously received more than 1 billion rubles from the budget to promote entrepreneurship, and that Synergy University had previously been fined for illegally collecting fingerprints from schoolchildren.

The university's claims related to information voiced by the blogger, previously published in the Russian media. The allocation of more than 1 billion rubles from the budget for business promotion and popularization of entrepreneurship was reported by the Rambler/Novosti portal, Kommersant, TASS, Delovoy Kvartal. In 2019, Kommersant reported on the illegal collection of fingerprints by Synergy from schoolchildren and the subsequent imposition of a fine on the university, and in 2020 — Vedomosti.

In a claim sent to the blogger, Synergy University threatened the blogger with criminal prosecution under Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (libel), as well as suing in the amount of 5 million rubles.


## High-profile cases

**Issuance of certificates for evading mobilization**

In October 2022, the media reported that employees at Synergy University had been identified selling certificates granting the right to deferral from conscription as part of partial mobilization. RBC, with reference to the Moscow news agency, reported that more than 800 facts of issuing fictitious certificates to avoid mobilization had been established. The cost of one certificate was 180 thousand rubles. The university management, together with law enforcement agencies, identified employees who sold certificates; criminal cases were initiated against them under part 3 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Document seizures and searches were carried out at the university and at the place of residence of the suspects.

**Refusal of admission to the university to the prodigies Teplyakov**

In July 2022, the father of nine-year-old Alice Teplyakoy submitted documents for the admission of his daughter and eight-year-old son Heimdall to Synergy University. The father applied for admission of nine—year-old Alice to five faculties at once: management - project management, banking, information systems and technologies, teacher education. Yevgeny Teplyakov submitted the documents of his eight—year-old son for admission to the faculties of general management - project management, business informatics, economics. Alice Teplyakova passed the Unified State Exam at the age of eight and enrolled in paid studies at the Faculty of Psychology of Moscow State University in 2021. After Yevgeny Teplyakov's fight with the head of the department, Alice did not attend classes at Moscow State University.

The University of Synergy refused to accept Teplyakovs for a paid department. Earlier, Alice was unable to pass the probation exam for budget places and Yevgeny Teplyakov submitted documents for paid tuition. Teplyakov was refused admission of children for education and the conclusion of a contract. The rector of the university, Artyom Vasiliev, motivated his refusal by the fact that students have been interning since the first year, and the labor code allows children to work only from the age of 14. In addition, Vasiliev appealed to the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation with a proposal to consider the possibility of amendments to the Federal Law "On Education" and to legislatively determine that admission to higher education institutions is possible only from the age of 15. Earlier it became known that Teplyakov was refused admission by the Moscow Innovation University.

After receiving a refusal to admit children to the university, the children's father, Yevgeny Teplyakov, insulted the rector of the university and the university itself on social networks, after which the university sent Teplyakov a pre—trial claim with demands to remove offensive materials and reserved the right to go to court for spreading deliberately false information, as well as public insults.

**The story on the TV channel Russia-1**

In February 2012, a video report "Darkness of Knowledge" was shown on the Rossiya-1 TV channel in the Vesti of the Week program, telling about the activities of the IFPU. In particular, in an interview with journalist Boris Sobolev, an MFPU student talked about buying exams, which was confirmed by shooting with a hidden camera.

The university itself denied the apology and stated that most of it was "skillful editing".

Later, a video produced by Synergy TV appeared on the network, in which the same student refuted what was said to the reporter. Later, the student again retracted his words.
