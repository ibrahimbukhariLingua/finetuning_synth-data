## Major programmes

Staged twice a year, EnviroSeries Conference aims to provide a cross-sector forum to discuss and address key issues related to Hong Kong's environmental sustainability.

To align with Hong Kong’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal, the rebranded Net-zero Carbon Charter, which was formerly launched as the BEC Low Carbon Charter in March 2019, aims to make a collective effort among businesses and organisations, urging them to set targets and actions for a net-zero future through a pledge. Under the framework of the Charter, BEC designs and hosts events and programmes to guide companies in formulating, executing, and achieving their objectives. As of June 2024, there is a total of 75 Charter Signatories, in which 20 are the Science-aligned Signatories, while the remaining 55 are Action Signatories.


## Major members
