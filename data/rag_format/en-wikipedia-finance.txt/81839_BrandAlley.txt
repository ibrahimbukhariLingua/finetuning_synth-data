## History

BrandAlley UK was launched as a joint venture between News International and BrandAlley France, in 2008. In 2013, the company was sold in a management buyout to CEO Rob Feldmann and Chairman Bruce MacInnes.

In 2010 BrandAlley sponsored ‘The Naturally Fashionable Garden’ at Chelsea Flower Show designed by British landscape designer Nicholas Dexter.

BrandAlley went on to sponsor subsequent gardens at Chelsea Flower Show in 2013 and 2014, both designed by award-winning gardener Paul Hervey-Brookes.

The business received investment from a Chinese e-tailer Vipshop in 2015 for a minority stake in the company. BrandAlley were shortlisted for a Drapers award in 2017, under the Pure Play E-tailer Of The Year category, alongside ASOS, The Outnet and Boohoo.

In February 2018 BrandAlley purchased homeware and beauty e-tailer Achica in a cash deal from the Dunelm Group. The deal added 200 new beauty, homeware and furniture brands to the BrandAlley business. Under the deal BrandAlley acquired 33 Achica staff, bringing the total number of UK employees to 85.
