North German thaler


# North German thaler



The **North German thaler** was a currency used by several states of Northern Germany from 1690 to 1873, first under the Holy Roman Empire, then by the German Confederation. Originally equal to the **Reichsthaler** specie or silver coin from 1566 until the *Kipper und Wipper* crisis of 1618, a *thaler* currency unit worth less than the *Reichsthaler specie* was first defined in 1667 and became widely used after adoption of the Leipzig currency standard of 1690.

After the 1840s, the different North German states made their thalers equal in value to the *Prussian thaler*; these thalers were then made par to the *Vereinsthaler* in 1857. The various North German *thalers* and *vereinsthalers* were all replaced in 1873 by the *German gold mark* at the rate of 3 marks per *thaler*.

Several old books confusingly use the same term **Reichsthaler** for the *specie silver coin* as well as the *currency unit*. This is disambiguated by referring to the full-valued coin as the *Reichsthaler specie* and the lower-valued currency unit as the *Reichsthaler currency (courant, kurant)*.


## History


### The *Reichsthaler* specie

In 1566 the Holy Roman Empire first introduced the *Reichsthaler* specie as a standard silver coin of all German states, minted 9 to a Cologne Mark of fine silver, or 25.984 g. It was divided in 24 *gutegroschen*, with each *gutegroschen* divided into 12 *pfennig*. Its value versus the currency unit, the *guilder*, rose from 1.2 gulden after 1566 to 1.5 gulden in 1618 just before the Thirty Years' War and *Kipper und Wipper* financial crisis destroyed the value of the *gulden* as well as Germany's financial system.


### Lower-valued *thaler* after 1630

After 1630 the different North German states reconstructed their currency systems with a *Thaler* worth 24 *gutegroschen* or 1+1⁄2 *gulden*, but little is on record with regard to the mint systems until after 1667. They were thus on a *de facto thaler* currency system with some uncertainty in the thaler's value versus the *Reichsthaler specie*. A currency trial done in 1665 indicated a lower prevailing (and unofficial) rate of 14+1⁄4 *gulden* or 9+1⁄2 *thaler* to a Cologne Mark.

Here is a summary of the evolution of standards of the *North German thaler* from 1667 to 1873 in grams of silver, together with the *Reichsthaler* specie (or *Conventionsthaler* specie after 1753), the *Austro-Hungarian florin* and the *South German gulden*.

### *Zinnaische* Standard, 1667

The *Zinnasche* currency standard was agreed upon in 1667 by Saxony and Brandenburg at Zinna, defining for the first time *de jure* a North German thaler currency issued at 10+1⁄2 to a Cologne Mark of silver, lower than the standard for the *Reichsthaler specie* at 9 to a Mark. While this system was implemented by the more financially able North German states (most notably by Hamburg, Lubeck & Denmark), it would not be widely adopted until introduction of the Leipzig standard of 1690.


### Leipzig Standard, 1690

The Leipzig standard was first introduced in 1690 by Saxony, Brandenburg, Brunswick and Lüneburg; in a few years this standard prevailed all over the Holy Roman Empire in the form of the *North German thaler* and the *South German gulden*. It defined the *thaler* and *gulden* currency units in relation to the *Reichsthaler specie* coin, as follows:

* The *Reichsthaler Specie* is issued 9 to a Cologne Mark of fine silver, or 25.984 g;
* The *North German Thaler* currency of 24 *gutegroschen* is 3⁄4 of specie, or 12 to a Mark, or 19.488 g silver; and
* The South German & Austrian *Gulden* of 60 *kreuzer* is 1⁄2 of specie, or 18 to a Mark, or 12.992 g silver.

At the same time this standard was introduced the gold florin or Rhenish gulden of 2.5036 g was advanced to a value of 2+56⁄60 gulden or 1+23⁄24 thaler – hence, 1.2784 g fine gold per thaler and a gold-silver ratio of 15.2. This would be Germany's new predominant currency system entering the 18th century.


### Unofficial Gold Standard, 1730s

The Leipzig currency system entered another era of crisis and fragmentation in the 18th century due to the War of Spanish Succession of 1700–1714 and the War of Austrian Succession of 1740–1748. In 1726 France devalued the *livre tournois* from 8.31 g to 4.505 g silver, and the gold-silver ratio went down from 15 to 14.5.

For the stronger states in Northern Germany & Austria this meant the opportunity to reissue their thaler and *gulden* currencies from silver to cheaper gold – hence an unofficial gold standard. By the 1730s the gold florin of 2.5036 g was valued at 3 Austrian florins or 2 North German thaler; hence each thaler was worth 1.2518 g fine gold or 18.15 g fine silver at France's gold ratio of 14.5 (vs 19.488 g silver originally). In 1741 Frederick the Great of Prussia issued the 6-gram gold *Friedrich d'or pistole* for a value of five thalers. It made the thaler even cheaper at 1.2 g gold or 17.4 g silver, and several North German states also came up with their own five-thaler pistoles.

For the South German states neighboring France, though, the need to lower their currencies even more has become much more acute, resulting in a *South German gulden* of lower value than the Austro-Hungarian florin which was made official after 1753.


### Austrian Convention Standard, 1753

The Austrian Convention currency standard (*Konventionsfuß*) was first introduced in 1750 to the territories of the Austrian Empire and in 1753 to the rest of Germany without taking measures to secure the cooperation of the other circles of the Holy Roman Empire. It restored the Reichsthaler's silver footing at a rate 10% lower than the Leipzig standard, as follows:

* The new *Conventionsthaler specie* coin, issued 10 to a Cologne Mark of fine silver; hence 23.3856 g.
* The *North German thaler* of 24 *gutegroschen* = 3⁄4 of *Conventionsthaler*; hence 13+1⁄3 to a Mark, or 17.5392 g
* The *Austro-Hungarian florin* of 60 *kreuzer* = 1⁄2 of *Conventionsthaler*; hence 20 to a Mark, or 11.6928 g.

Several other states did not comply with this footing, however. The Southern German states settled on a lower-valued *South German gulden* worth 24 to a Cologne Mark fine silver or 9.744 g. The *Prussian Thaler* was also set lower at 14 to a Cologne Mark or 16.704 g.

Most of the North German thalers were divided into 24 *gutegroschen*, with each *gutegroschen* equal to 12 *pfennig*. Silver coins minted for circulation include the *Conventionsthaler* worth 32 *gutegroschen* or 1+1⁄3 *thalers*; *guldens* worth 16 *gutegroschen* or 2⁄3 *thaler*, and smaller coins worth 8, 4, 2 and 1 *gutegroschen*. The *pistole* of 6 grams fine gold, together with double- and half-pistole coins, became (along with the ducat) the preferred gold currency in Northern Germany, with each pistole trading at five thalers plus a variable *agio* (premium) after gold prices rebounded in the second half of the 18th century.


### Prussian *Thaler* and *Vereinsthaler* after 1840

The final task of currency unification in Germany was completed by Prussia between 1837 and 1873 after the Napoleonic Wars. The *Zollverein* customs union of 1834 unleashed a more vigorous adoption of the *Prussian thaler* of 14 to a Cologne Mark (16.704 g fine silver). In 1837 the Southern German states fixed the *South German Gulden* at 1+3⁄4 gulden to the Prussian thaler, or 24+1⁄2 gulden to a Mark. After the 1840s the different Northern German states fixed their respective *thalers* at par with the Prussian thaler also at 14 to a Mark.

Concurrent with this switchover is a change in coin subdivisions, with the *thaler* now divided into 30 *silbergroschen*. New silver coins were issued for 10 *silbergroschen* worth 1⁄3 thaler, as well as smaller coins for 5, 2+1⁄2 and 1 *silbergroschen*.

In 1857 all German states and Austria agreed to mint the *Vereinsthaler* of 16+2⁄3 grams fine silver, of marginally smaller weight than the Prussian thaler's 16.704 g, but still accepted at par with the Northern German *thaler*. Austria also lowered its *gulden* to 2⁄3 of the *Vereinsthaler* or 11+1⁄9 g.


### Gold Standard

All North German *thalers* and *Vereinsthalers* were retired after 1873 in favor of the German gold mark, with each mark containing 100⁄279 gram of fine gold, at the rate of 1 thaler = 3 marks, or a gold ratio of 15.5. While new silver coins issued under the mark were limited legal tender for payments under 20 marks, the *Vereinsthaler* retained full, unlimited legal tender status until it was demonetized in 1908.


## Other

Thaler currencies identical to the North German *thaler* include the *Hesse-Kassel thaler*, *Saxon thaler* and *Stolberg thaler*, though not all may be divided into 24 *gutegroschen*.

Currencies identical to the *Vereinsthaler*, and all divided into 30 *silbergroschen*, include the *Prussian vereinsthaler*, *Hanoverian vereinsthaler*, *Hesse-Kassel vereinsthaler* and *Mecklenburg vereinsthaler*.

A number of North German states followed both the Leipzig standard after 1690 and the unofficial gold standard after 1730, but did not follow the Austrian Convention standard of 131⁄3 to a Cologne Mark (or 17.539 g fine silver) after 1753. The most notable of these are as follows:

* The *Prussian thaler* adopted the *Graumannscher Fuß* (Graumann footing) of 1⁄14 of a Cologne Mark, or 16.704 g fine silver. After 1840, however, several North German states lowered their *thalers* to match this standard.
* The *Bremen thaler* retained the gold standard until German unification in 1871, with five *thalers* to a *Friedrich d'or pistole*, or about 1.2 g fine gold per thaler. It was also divided differently, into 72 *grote*. After 1857 this standard was defined more exactly at 8.4 *thalers* per 10 grams fine gold, or 1+4⁄21 g gold per thaler.
* The *Hanoverian thaler* reverted to the Leipzig standard of 1⁄12 of a Cologne Mark after the rise in gold prices in the second half of the 18th century. It was also divided differently into 36 *mariengroschen*. In 1834 Hanover phased out this stronger standard in favor of the Prussian thaler.
* Currencies of identical value to the *Hanoverian thaler* include the *Mecklenburg thaler* and the *Westphalian thaler*.

Currencies whose standards differed from the North German thaler after 1690 include:

* The *Hamburg mark* and the *Lübeck mark*.
* The *Danish rigsdaler*, *Norwegian rigsdaler* and *Swedish riksdaler*. They were also issued in multiple versions labeled *species* or *courant*.
* All *écus* and *thalers* issued in Switzerland listed here: *Swiss franc#Before the Helvetic Confederation*
