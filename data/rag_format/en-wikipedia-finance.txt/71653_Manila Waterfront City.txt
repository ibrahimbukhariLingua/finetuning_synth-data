## History


### Approval and construction

In March 2021, the project gained the approval of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), the first reclamation project to be approved by PCC. On August 18, 2022, the Philippine Reclamation Authority granted the request of WMPDI to start its reclamation works. On February 22, 2023, National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) released an advisory about the start of sand piling works from February 21, 2023 to August 19, 2023, thereby officially starting the MWC's land reclamation works.


### Opposition from the US Embassy

The US Embassy in Manila has opposed the project as it would eventually surround the embassy compound, citing reasons such as worsening the flooding around the embassy and the detrimental effects to American interests and reputation of the China-backed project.
