## Structure

Bigger law firms in the Netherlands are often organised as a partnership, private limited liability company (B.V. or Dutch: *besloten vennootschap*), public company (N.V. or Dutch: *naamloze vennootschap*)) or cooperative. It is common for a law firm to have notaries attached to it. Smaller law firms sometimes opt for a maatschap, where all lawyers run their own offices, but share the costs of rent, employees and marketing.
