# Hitachi Consulting



**Hitachi Consulting Corporation** was an American international management and technology consulting firm with headquarters in Dallas, Texas. It was founded in November 2000 as a subsidiary of the Japanese corporation Hitachi, and employed approximately 6,500 people in the US, Japan, Brazil, China, India, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, the UK, Germany, and Vietnam.


## History

Hitachi Consulting was founded in November 2000 when the Japanese multinational corporation Hitachi acquired Grant Thornton LLPâ€™s Chicago based information technology and strategy consulting practice. Three former Grant Thornton principals (Chuck Scoville - COO, Mike Driessen - Sales/Marketing, and Dan Raskas - Delivery of Services) were the founding leadership team along with 18 former Grant Thornton partners and principals.

Since then, the company has acquired a number of consulting competitors including WaveBend Solutions from BDO Seidman (June 2001), Tactica Technology (November 2001), Aspirity (April 2004), Dove Consulting (August 2005), Navigator Systems (February 2006), Impact Plus through the subsidiary Hitachi Consulting UK (April 2007), Iteration2 (June 2007), and JMN Associates (March 2008). After the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, 23 partners and 370 consultants of Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC) also joined the company in June 2002.

At the time of its initial acquisition from Grant Thornton, Hitachi Consulting was named Experio Solutions. This name remained until an agreement was reached to license the Hitachi name in 2003. In April 2006, Exsurge, a Hitachi-owned Japanese consulting firm, was accordingly renamed Hitachi Consulting Co., Ltd.
