Mileage Plan


# Mileage Plan



**Mileage Plan** is the frequent-flyer program of Alaska Airlines. Members accrue program "miles" by flying Alaska Airlines and partner-operated flights, using co-branded credit cards, and booking vacation and hotel packages, among other methods. Mileage Plan miles can be redeemed for award flights on Alaska Airlines and partner carriers and provide eligibility for elite status with Mileage Plan.


## History

In June 1983, Alaska Airlines introduced their frequent-flyer program, Gold Coast Travel. In 1987, Alaska Airlines acquired Jet America Airlines, which offered a frequent-flyer program that awarded credit by flight segments (number of flights taken), compared to Gold Coast Travel, where members earned credit based on the mileage of flights taken. After acquisition by Alaska Airlines, participants of Jet America's frequent-flyer program were enrolled in Gold Coast Travel, and in September 1989, Gold Coast Travel was renamed Mileage Plan. Alaska Airlines also purchased regional commuter airline Horizon Air in 1986 and incorporated the carrier into Mileage Plan.

In 2016, Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America, which offered a revenue-based accrual program, Elevate. On January 1, 2018, Elevate was discontinued, with all remaining accounts converted to Mileage Plan accounts.


## Oneworld Membership

Alaska Airlines is a member of the Oneworld airline alliance. Passengers can book codeshare and interlining itineraries on all Oneworld airlines through Alaska Airlines. Mileage Plan miles may be redeemed for flights on Oneworld carriers, and Mileage Plan elite status is reciprocally recognized by member airlines.

In February 2020, Alaska Airlines announced its intention to join the Oneworld alliance in the summer of 2021. This would add seven new airline partners, including Iberia, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, and SriLankan Airlines. In October 2020, Alaska announced its Oneworld membership date had been moved to March 21, 2021.

In December 2020, Oneworld member Qatar Airways established a mileage partnership with Alaska prior to the commencement of nonstop service from Seattle to Doha.

On March 31, 2021, Alaska Airlines officially joined the Oneworld alliance. Alaska temporarily suspended its partnership with S7 Airlines on March 1, 2022, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In September 2024, Alaska Airlines' purchase of Hawaiian Airlines was finalized and closed, with the latter retaining its independent branding. A combined loyalty program was announced as forthcoming, with Hawaiian Airlines also projected to join Oneworld in 2026, after merging into one operating certificate.

Alaska Airlines flights, including Horizon Air flights, have been bookable as part of Oneworld Global Explorer fares since 2008.

Mileage Plan includes 30 partner airlines that comprise the Alaska Global Partners, with two additional partners pending. Partner airlines include Oneworld, SkyTeam, and Star Alliance members, as well as unaffiliated airlines.

### Future Partners

Oman Air is projected to be a partner when it becomes a full Oneworld member in 2024, and is currently a partner airline eligible for Mileage Plan award redemptions.

Hawaiian Airlines' purchase by Alaska Airlines was closed in September 2024, with a combined loyalty program was announced as forthcoming. Airline status recognition, mileage balances, mileage accrual, and award redemptions are expected to be combinable, interchangeable, and reciprocal under Mileage Plan, and Hawaiian Airlines' 'HawaiianMiles' program in the interim.


### Former Partners

Delta had been a mileage partner from 2004 until 2017, when it established Seattle as a hub city. The partnership with Delta was preceded by a partnership with Northwest Airlines in 1995, prior to the merger of the two airlines. Alaska Airlines was also a former mileage partner with other SkyTeam members, including Aeromexico, from 2013 until 2017, and Air France and KLM, from 2007 until 2018.

Emirates ceased to be a partner in 2021, shortly after Alaska joined the Oneworld alliance and became partners with regional rival Qatar Airways. The two airlines had a mileage agreement starting in 2012.


## Award Mileage Accrual

Mileage Plan miles may be used to redeem award flights on Alaska Airlines and eligible Global Partner airlines.

On all scheduled Alaska Airlines flights (including flights operated by Horizon Air and SkyWest), members accrue miles based on the actual flight miles flown. In Economy class, members accrue at least 1 mile per mile flown (except when booked in Saver class, where accrual is 30% of miles flown). In First class, members accrue at least 1.5 miles per mile flown.

On flights under 500 miles, a minimum of 500 miles are awarded. Miles can also be accrued by flying eligible flights on Alaska Global Partners. When flying partner airlines booked on Alaska Airline's website, accrual ranges from 1 mile (economy) to 3.5 miles (first class) per mile flown. When flying partner airlines booked elsewhere, accrual ranges from 0.25 miles (discount economy) to 1.5 miles (first class) flown.

Beginning in 2015, most airlines in the United States switched to revenue-based accrual programs, where credit is awarded based on the fare paid. Alaska Airlines has previously indicated that retaining a distance-based accrual program is a competitive advantage over other carriers. Among major carriers in the United States, only Hawaiian Airlines also accrue one mile per mile flown. No other major airline offers a minimum accrual amount (e.g. 500 miles) for passengers lacking elite status.


## Membership Elite Tiers

Mileage Plan's elite tiers for frequent travelers are MVP, MVP Gold, MVP Gold 75K, and MVP Gold 100K. These elite tiers also confer corresponding Oneworld elite status.

Members in elite tiers receive benefits compared to non-elite members, including complimentary upgrades to First and Premium Class, increased mileage accrual, priority check-in and boarding, discount or free lounge access, complimentary checked bags, and other benefits.

Starting in 2024, MileagePlan elite status is only earned through accrued 'Elite Qualifying Miles' (EQMs). EQM accrual matches earning rates for award flight miles, while including additional accrual methods. There is no minimum spending requirement, nor is there a minimum number of Alaska Airlines flights required to be flown to receive elite status in Mileage Plan.

Additionally, members who fly 1,000,000 miles on Alaska Airlines are granted MVP Gold status for life. Members who fly 2,000,000 miles are granted MVP Gold 75K status for life. Members reaching these thresholds may also nominate a household member to receive the same status.

Members also receive one-time perks when reaching 11 specified EQM milestones in a year, such as bonus miles; complimentary meals, wifi, lounge access, or upgrades; gifting status to another person; or rolling over EQMs to the next year. Milestones include 10K, 20K, 30K, 40K, 55K, 75K, 85K, 100K, 150K, 200K, and 250K.

Members are awarded elite status at the following EQM thresholds:

| Alaska Elite Tier | MVP | MVP Gold | MVP Gold 75K | MVP Gold 100K |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Oneworld Elite Tier | oneworld Ruby | oneworld Sapphire | oneworld Emerald | oneworld Emerald |
| Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) Required | 20,000 | 40,000 | 75,000 | 100,000 |

EQMs may be accrued through these methods:

| Accrual Method | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Flying Alaska Airlines * Saver * Economy * First | * 0.3 EQM per mile flown * 1 to 1.5 EQM per mile flown * 1.5 to 2 EQM per mile flown |
| Flying partner airlines (booked on Alaska's website) | 1 EQM (discount economy) to 3.5 EQM (international first) per mile flown |
| Flying partner airlines (booked elsewhere) | 0.25 EQM (discount economy) to 1.5 EQM (international first) per mile flown |
| Award travel (booked with Mileage Plan, any airline) | 1 EQM (all classes) per mile flown |
| Alaska Airlines-branded Visa Cards | 1 EQM per $3 spent (up to 30,000 EQM per year) |
| Mileage Plan (non-airline) partners | 1000 EQM per 3000 miles earned |

* **^1** Includes flights operated by Alaska Airlines, Alaska Horizon Air, Alaska SkyWest.

## Additional Benefits

Mileage Plan members are eligible to check in one case of wine (up to 12 bottles) for free when flying domestically, if departing from one of 32 airports in California, Idaho, Oregon, or Washington.

In March 2016, Alaska Airlines introduced a temporary, promotional award where Mileage Plus members could redeem 10,000 miles to cover the $85 cost of a TSA PreCheck screening application charged by the Transportation Security Administration.


## Club 49

Members who are residents of the State of Alaska, or military personnel permanently stationed in Alaska are eligible to participate in Alaska Airlines' *Club 49* program.
Benefits include:

* Two complimentary checked bags on flights to or from Alaska, for participants and all passengers traveling on the same reservation
* Two Travel Now annual discounts for 30% off refundable one-way Y-class economy fares to, from, or within Alaska on Alaska Airlines, when booked within four days of departure
* Weekly fare sales via email for destinations within and outside Alaska

## Huaka‘i

In late 2024, Hawaii residents will be eligible to join the Huaka'i program, providing benefits such as 10% off one inter-island booking per quarter, a free checked bag, and exclusive network-wide deals each month. Hawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard cardmembers will receive 20% off one inter-island flight per quarter, on top of the existing cardholder benefit of two free checked bags.


## Recognition

As of 2022, Mileage Plan has been the recipient of the U.S. News & World Report Best Airline Reward Program for seven consecutive years since 2015, based on an airline's overall evaluation of six criteria: ease of earning a free round-trip flight, benefits, network coverage, flight volume, award flight availability and airline quality ratings.
