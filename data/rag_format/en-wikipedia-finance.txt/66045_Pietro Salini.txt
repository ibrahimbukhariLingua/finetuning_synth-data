## Biography

After graduating from La Sapienza University in Rome, in 1987, in Economics and Business, Salini joined the Salini Group – a construction company founded in the 1930s – taking on important roles in management and international development. In 1987 Salini embarked on his professional career at Salini Costruttori SpA, implementing strategies to foster international growth.

In 1994, Salini was appointed chief executive officer of Salini Costruttori. 2009 saw the acquisition by Salini of Todini Costruzioni Generali SpA (from 60% to 77,71% of ownership interest) making Salini Costruttori the third largest construction group in Italy behind fellow competitors Astaldi and Impregilo.

In 2010, Salini was appointed as chief executive officer of Todini Costruzioni Generali SpA. 2011 saw further external growth by Salini through the acquisition of an equity stake (15%) in Impregilo SpA. In July 2012, after both a proxy fight and a board meeting aimed at changing current management, Salini was appointed chief executive officer of Impregilo.

In April 2013, after a voluntary public tender offer for Impregilo, Salini Group took over 92% of Impregilo, paving the way for the formal merger of Salini into Impregilo. In 2014 Salini was appointed as chief executive officer of the new Salini Impregilo group. Today the Salini Impregilo Group boasts a construction portfolio above €29bn with operations in over 50 countries across 5 continents, employing approximately 31,000 people.
