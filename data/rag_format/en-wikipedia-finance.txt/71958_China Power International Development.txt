## History

China Power International Development Limited was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2004. Its predecessor and direct parent company, another Hong Kong incorporated company, China Power International Holding Limited (Chinese: 中國電力國際有限公司; lit. 'China Power International Co.', ' Ltd.'), was founded in 1994. It is ultimately controlled by the State Power Investment Corporation (previously China Power Investment Corporation), one of the five large national power generating groups that were administered by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. CPID is engaged in developing, constructing, owning, managing and operating large power plants in China.

CPID was listed in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on 15 October 2004. It was the only red chip company among the big 5 electric power generation companies of the Mainland China, the other three were H shares companies as well as dual listed in the Mainland China. The last listed subsidiary, was listed only in the Mainland China stock exchange.

In 2009 CPID acquired 63% equity interests in Wu Ling Power making hydroelectric power 18.73% of its total installed capacity, the highest of any of the Chinese IPPs. This protects the company from the costs of coal power in China, and makes its overall profile cleaner.
