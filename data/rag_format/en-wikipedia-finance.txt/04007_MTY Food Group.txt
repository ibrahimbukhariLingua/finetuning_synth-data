MTY Food Group


# MTY Food Group



**MTY Food Group Inc.** is a Canadian franchisor and operator of numerous casual dining, fast casual, and quick service restaurants operating under more than 70 brand names, some of them through wholly owned subsidiaries. Headquartered in the Montreal borough of Saint-Laurent, Quebec, the number of outlets carrying MTY brands reached 5,500 in 2017. Stanley Ma is the group founder, President and CEO. Some of MTY Food Group's brands include Thaï Express, Country Style, Groupe Valentine, Vanelli's, Extreme Pita, Taco Time, Yogen Früz, and the Canadian branch of TCBY.

Since opening the first Tiki Ming restaurant in 1984, MTY launched ten brands and acquired more than twenty others. Four of the restaurant chains—Vanelli's, Caferama, Sukiyaki, and La Cremiere—also operate in the Middle East. There used to be a computer and technology division named Gold Tech Computer Systems Ltd., but it was spun off in 2003, renaming itself MTY Food Group Inc.

In 2017, most of its restaurants were located in shopping malls and cinema food courts with others located in convenience stores. But by 2019, only 22 percent of its stores were in food courts. The company owes much of its growth to corporate takeovers (in 2013, 80 percent of the company's revenue growth was attributable to acquisitions). It operates in Canada, United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Morocco and in 2009 revenue from franchise fees increased 75 percent. It joined the Toronto Stock Exchange as a debt-free company in June 2010. Prior to this it traded on the TSX Venture Exchange for 15 years under four different names.

Of its 2,700 Canadian units, 98 percent are franchisee owned.


## History

In 1979, 29 year old Stanley Ma opened a restaurant called Le Paradis du Pacifique on St. Martin Blvd in Laval, 11 years after he arrived in Canada from Hong Kong. In 1984, he opened the first of 56 Tiki Ming restaurants in Canada in Mount Royal's Rockland Centre. In 1986, the predecessor company was incorporated as Golden Sky Resources Inc. and publicly traded on the Vancouver Stock Exchange (now the TSX Venture Exchange) in February 1989. The company first went public in 1995, there were 70 locations at the time. The name of the company was later changed to Golden Sky Ventures International Inc. in 1994, then to iNsu Innovations Group Inc. in 2000, and then to its current name MTY Food Group Inc. in 2003. It moved from the TSX Venture Exchange to the TSX exchange under the symbol MTY in May 2010 one year after it acquired Country Style Food Services.

On November 30, 2010, the company created two new subsidiaries when it combined five former ones. Country Style Food Services Holdings Inc., Buns Master Bakery Systems Inc. and Melody Farms Specialty Foods & Equipment Limited were regrouped into one subsidiary, the other came from Mrs. Vanelli's Restaurants Limited and MTY Tiki Ming Enterprises Inc. The move improved short term cash flow by enabling it to take advantage of non-capital tax losses quicker.

On May 21, 2010, president, CEO, and chairman of MTY Food Group Stanley Ma opened the Toronto Stock Exchange.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ

In 2016, in a bid for faster expansion, MTY offered to buy the Quebec-based St-Hubert chain of restaurants with its rich chicken product menu. MTY's offer was rejected in favour of the purchase of St Hubert brand by Ontario-based Cara Operations.

In December 2017, however, MTY announced that it was finishing a purchase deal of Imvescor Restaurant Group Inc., a Canadian company with restaurants and food outlets under the five brands Toujours Mikes, Pizza Delight, Scores Rotisserie, Bâton Rouge, and Ben & Florentine. The purchase tag is reportedly $248 million CAD in a stock-and-cash deal, and will add another 262 existing outlets of the said brands with a reported annual sales figures of 416 million Canadian dollars. The purchase was finalized by the end of February 2018. Imvescor chairman Francois-Xavier Seigneur said joining forces with MTY creates opportunities for Imvescor shareholders from an offer he described as representing a "full and fair value." The combined company is expected to generate about $2.9 billion in annual sales.

In February 2018, MTY announced that it was acquiring two new brands, Timothy's and Mmmuffin.
