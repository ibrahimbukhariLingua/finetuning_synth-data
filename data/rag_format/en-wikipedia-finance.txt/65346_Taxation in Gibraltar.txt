**Taxation in Gibraltar** is determined by the law of Gibraltar which is based on English law, but is separate from the UK legal system. Companies and non residents do not pay income tax unless the source of this income is or is deemed to be Gibraltar. Individuals pay tax on a worldwide basis on income from employment or self employment if they are ordinarily resident in Gibraltar. There is no tax on capital income.

In Gibraltar there is no capital gains tax, wealth tax, sales tax or value added tax. Import duty is payable on all items at 10%. The main tax for companies is Corporation Tax, and Social insurance contributions. There are also stamp duties on certain transactions, and property taxes ('rates'). Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade, offshore banking, and its position as an international conference center. It is a well known and regulated international finance centre and has been a popular jurisdiction for European offshore companies. The financial sector, tourism, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods generate revenue. Non-resident companies can take advantage of a number of offshore regimes in order to reduce taxation, although in line with the elimination of unfair tax practices this is being phased out. Individuals pay quite high taxes on their income in Gibraltar unless they are able to take advantage of high-net-worth individual status or gain exemption as an expatriate executive. Import duties are quite high on some items.

Assessment and collection of tax is administered by the Commissioner of Income Tax; the tax year runs from 1 July to the following 30 June.

## Import duties

Import duties are levied on goods imported into Gibraltar, mostly at rates of 0% - 12%. As of 1 July 2010, import duty on pedal cycles, electric cars, solar paneling and related equipment has been reduced to 0%.

With effect from 1 January 2011, a new rate of 10% will apply to all companies except energy and utility providers, which will pay a 10% surcharge and thus incur a rate of 20%. These will include electricity, fuel, telephone service and water providers.

As an anti-avoidance provision, it will not apply in respect of any commercial activity being carried out before 25 June 2009 and that is reorganized by the taxpayer in the name of a different entity for the purpose of benefiting from the scheme.

## Income tax rates

Gibraltar has two tax systems, one based on gross income which does not provide any allowances, and another with different rates which does. The choice of which system to apply is made by the taxable person.


### Gross Income Based System

1. Persons on gross income up to £16,000

| Income | Rate | Payable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - £10,000 | 8% | £800 |
| £10,001 - £16,000 | 20% | £1200 |

2. Persons on gross income £16,000 to £25,000

| Income | On first | Rate | Balance at 20% | Payable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| £16,001 - £17,000 | £6000 | 0% | £10,001 - £11,000 | £2,000 - £2,200 |
| £17,001 - £18,000 | £5,000 | 0% | £12,001 - £13,000 | £2,400 - £2,600 |
| £18,001 - £19,000 | £4000 | 0% | £14,001 - £15,000 | £2,800 - £3,000 |
| £19,001 - £20,000 | £3000 | 0% | £16,001 - £17,000 | £3,200 - £3,400 |
| £20,001 - £25,000 | £2000 | 0% | £18,001 - £23,000 | £3,600 - £4,600 |

3. Persons on gross income between £25,001 and £35,000

A rate of 20% applies less tapering relief on gross income between £25,001 and £26,000. With the tapering relief on gross income of £25,000, there is a tax-free amount of £2000 that reduces by £2 for every £1 increase in gross income.

4. Persons on gross income between £35,001 and £100,000

The effective (average) tax rate is reduced by 0.5% from the previous year using a complex formula to give a maximum effective tax rate of 26.25% on gross income of £100,000. The tax liability is arrived at by first calculating using the previous year's tax band (i.e. 20% for tax bands of £0 - £25,000 and 29% for £25,001 - £100,000), then reducing it by 0.5% and finally applying the resulting rate of taxable income (gross income less tapering relief). With the tapering relief on gross income of £35,001, there is a tax-free amount of £3284 that reduces by £2 for every £1 increase in gross income.

5. Persons on gross income between £100,001 and £353,000

A rate of 20% on the first £25,000 of gross income applies, with the balance taxed at 29%. With the tapering relief on gross income of £100,001, there is a tax-free amount of £1722 that reduces by £2 for every £1 increase in gross income.

6. Individuals on Gross Income over £353,000

| Taxed As Follows | Tax Rate |
| --- | --- |
| First £25,001 | 20% |
| £25,001 - £353,000 | 29% |
| £353,001 - £704,800 | 20% |
| £704,801 - £1,000,000 | 10% |
| Excess over £1,000,000 | 5% |


### Allowance Based Scheme

| Bands | Tax Rate | Tax on band |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 - 4,000 | 17% (reduced rate) | £680 |
| 4,001 - 16,000 | 30% (standard rate) | £3,600 |
