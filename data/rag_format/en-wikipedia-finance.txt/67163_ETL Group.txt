# ETL Group



The **ETL Group** is a multinational group of companies providing tax, legal, auditing and management consultancy services. It is Germany's largest tax advisory company, with an annual turnover of over €950 million (2019), putting it among the top five auditing and tax advisory companies in the Federal Republic.

The ETL Group employs 10,000 partners and staff, including more than 1,500 tax advisors, lawyers, auditors and management consultants. Currently, the group has some 200,000 clients in about 870 offices across Germany. Additionally, the ETL Group operates in almost 50 countries throughout the world under the "ETL Global" brand.


## History

At the beginning of the 1970s, Franz-Josef Wernze and Klaus F. K. Schmidt joined forces to open a tax advisory office. The services they offered were soon extended beyond mere tax advice. Wernze and Schmidt took a holistic approach that combined tax advice with auditing and legal services in a one-stop consultancy package. Since 1995, the group of companies providing these services has been operating under the "ETL" brand.


## Services

The ETL Group offers consultancy services for private individuals, freelancers as well as small and medium-sized enterprise. These services are available for all questions regarding tax, legal, economic, organizational and financial issues. Customized consultancy and strategy concepts have been developed for petrol station proprietors, health care professionals, hotel and restaurant owners, farmers and foresters, franchising, senior citizens and professional athletes.

The felix1.de AG Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, launched in 2014, focuses on target groups with a higher affinity for the online world and complements classical consultancy services with digital components such as online identification.
