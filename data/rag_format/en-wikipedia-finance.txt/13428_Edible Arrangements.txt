## History

The company was founded by Tariq Farid and Kamran Farid, and the first Edible Arrangements store opened in East Haven, Connecticut in 1999.

The first official franchise location opened in Waltham, Massachusetts. However, the first store was in Hamden, Connecticut.

In 2009, Edible Arrangements announced the signing of master franchisee agreements in Rome, Italy, and Hong Kong. The Rome master franchise was purchased by VPF International Ltd, and the franchise for Hong Kong was purchased by D.T. Hong Kong Ltd, which is owned by Sanja Dujic.

## Franchisee lawsuit

The issue began in 2010 when Edible Arrangements faced dissatisfaction from some of its franchisees. In January 2010, more than 270 franchisees presented Farid with individual letters expressing opposition to corporate policies and practices that they considered to be harmful to their individual franchised businesses. The franchisees formed the Edible Arrangements Independent Franchisee Association (EAIFA) and hired an attorney to represent them in possible litigation. On September 20, 2010, the group filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of 170 franchisees, alleging that several changes the company made in its franchise agreements were unfair or violated contractual obligations to the franchisees. Edible Arrangements International responded to inquiries about the lawsuit by saying that they strongly disagreed with the accusations and would vigorously defend the complaint. The company subsequently initiated a motion in the courts to dismiss the case, but this attempt was denied by a District of Connecticut judge on July 19, 2011, and the franchisees were granted authority to pursue the case on all claims. In 2013, after months of negotiations, Edible Arrangements and EAIFA settled the lawsuit out of court.


## Sponsorship and awards

Edible Arrangements has established a charitable gift giving program with National Breast Cancer Research Foundation in national and local level as a part of Breast Cancer Awareness month each October. Stores located throughout the United States and Canada have established a relationship with the Breast Cancer Society of United States and Canada. In the United States, during the months of September and October 2010, 10% of the purchase price from the Awareness Celebration, Breast Cancer Awareness Bouquet and Heels for Healing Bouquet was donated to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.
