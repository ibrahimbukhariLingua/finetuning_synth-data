## Career

Kirk was admitted to the bar in 1980, becoming the only attorney in Bland, Virginia, and began a practice he ran until 1990.

Kirk and his partners would go on to sell the business to Henry Schein, Inc. for $65 million in 1998.

In 1996, Kirk founded New River Pharmaceuticals, where he served as chairman and CEO and took the company public in 2004.

Kirk became involved with biotechnology company Intrexon in the 2000s. He was named chairman of its board in 2008 and became CEO in 2009. Kirk took Intrexon public in 2013, taking the company's market cap to $2.5 billion with the IPO. In early 2020, Intrexon adopted the name of its subsidiary, Precigen, and narrowed its focus to human gene editing. With the change in name the CEO of subsidiary Precigen, Helen Sabzevari, took over leadership of the company from Kirk.
