## Recycling

Paper for recycling is a major source of the paper industry's raw material, which is why the industry pushes for new heights for the European recycling rate. The recycling rate reached 71.5% in 2015 - exceeding the voluntary target of 70% that was set by the industries declaration in 2011 - along the paper value chain (ERPC). The total amount of paper collected and sent to recycling in paper mills in 2015 was almost 56 million tonnes, an increase of 28.1% since 2000. 18.2% was exported for recycling in third countries.


## European Paper Week

European Paper Week is the annual event that unites representatives globally from the European paper industry. It normally takes place at the event of the year in Brussels, Belgium.

The High-Level session is the key event at European Paper Week presenting high-level speakers not only from the industry, but also from the European institutions and other sectors. It focuses on the big issues shaping the European industry's future and discusses the future of the pulp and paper industry in the context of EU policy and the effects of globalisation.

A number of other key meetings and seminars are organised in the course of European Paper Week by industry sectors and organisations along the paper chain.
