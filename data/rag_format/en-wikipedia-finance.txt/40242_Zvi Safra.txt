## Research

Safra's body of work is in the fields of individual choice under risk and under uncertainty, bargaining, and social choice. His main contribution to decision theory is the rigorous analysis of the preference reversal phenomenon and the demonstration that for individuals who violate the independence axiom, the Becker, DeGroot and Marshack mechanism of utility elicitation may fail.

His contribution was cited hundreds of times, including by several Nobel prize winners in economics: Daniel Kahnman, Alvin Roth in his Handbook of Experimental Economics, Richard Thaler and Vernon Smith.

Other contributions to decision theory include the pioneering analysis of risk aversion in the rank-dependent model, the first analysis of auctions without expected utility, and the discovery that not only expected utility, but all known models of decision under risk are vulnerable to Matthew Rabin's calibration criticism.

His main contribution to bargaining theory is the extension of the axiomatic Nash bargaining solution to ordinal and non-expected utility preferences. His main contributions to social choice theory include an axiomatization of individual behavior that is motivated by an intrinsic sense of fairness, and an extension of Harsanyi's impartial observer model that can accommodate concerns for fairness and different individuals’ risk attitudes, and that yields the Prioritarian social welfare function as a special case.
