More Money Than God


# More Money Than God



***More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite*** (2010) is a financial book by Sebastian Mallaby published by Penguin Press. Mallaby's work has been published in the *Financial Times*, *The Washington Post*, *The New York Times*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and the *Atlantic Monthly* as columnist, editor and editorial board member. He is a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The book is a history of the hedge fund industry in the United States looking at the people, institutions, investment tools and concepts of hedge funds. It claims to be the "first authoritative history of the hedge fund industry." It is written for a general audience and originally published by Penguin Press. It was nominated for the 2010 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award and was one of *The Wall Street Journal*'s 10-Best Books of 2010. The *Journal* said it was "The fullest account we have so far of a too-little-understood business that changed the shape of finance and no doubt will continue to do so."

In a review in *The New York Times*, the book was called a "smart history of the hedge fund business" that explains "how finance’s richest moguls made their loot," and "argues that the obsessive, charismatic oddballs of the hedge fund world are Wall Street’s future — and possibly its salvation."
