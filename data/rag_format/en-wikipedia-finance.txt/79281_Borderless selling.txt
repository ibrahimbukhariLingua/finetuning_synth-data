**Borderless selling** is the process of selling services to clients outside the country of origin of services through modern methods which eliminate the actions specifically designed to hinder international trade. International trade through "borderless selling" is a new phenomenon born in the current "globalization" era.


## Definitions

**Borderless selling** is the process of performing sales transaction between two or more parties from different countries (an exporter and an importer) which is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and import quotas.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Background

International trade, which is the exchange of goods and services across international borders, has been present throughout much of history of economics, society and politics.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

It is assumedᵇʸ ʷʰᵒᵐ? that offshore outsourcing gave birth to "borderless selling". The selling of services by offshore outsourcing service providers to foreign clients is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and import quotas. This is largely because most of the services are sold or delivered electronically from the offshore service provider to the foreign client. This phenomenon gave birth to borderless selling.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

There is a high correlation between outsourcing and exporting activity.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ However, borderless selling is different from free international trade or selling. Under the belief in mercantilism, most nations had high tariffs and many restrictions on international trade for centuries. In the 19th century, a belief in free trade became paramount in the west, especially in Britain and this outlook has since then dominated the thinking of western nations. Traditionally international trade was possible between only those countries which regulated international trade through bilateral treaties. Borderless selling is possible between any two countries of the world because services can be exported using modern telecommunication networks without the need to regulate trade.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
