## Partnerships


### China

In October 2024, the Chinese company CNOOC Limited announced that it signed an Exploration, Development & Production Contract (EDPC) with the company. CNOOC has won a bid to explore an oil block, Block-7, located in Diwaniyah province, Iraq. This marks a significant shift in Iraq's oil industry as it moves away from technical service contracts and adopts a profit-sharing model with international partners.


### Pakistan

In October 2024, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) has reached a settlement with Iraq's Midland Oil Company regarding their expired exploration and production contract for Block-8 in Iraq. This marks the end of their partnership in this particular project.
