John Harrington reviewed *Wall $treet Raider* and *Wall Street Wizard* for *Games International* magazine, and gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that "In the end, choosing between the two may come down to that hoary old question of what is preferable: game or simulation. *Wizard* puts the emphasis on fun and plays better than *Raider* as a solo game, and would therefore better suit the 'seat of the pants' style of player.."

The reviewer from *Aktueller Software Markt* felt that people playing stock market games just for fun would enjoy *Wall Street Wizard* thanks to the lively design.

The reviewer from German magazine *ST Computer* felt that the game did a good job of emulating the market atmosphere, and liked its many options and features, commenting that the graphics were good for a strategy game but bemoaned the lack of sound.

The reviewer from German magazine *Joystick* felt that it was a well done and realistic real time German stock market simulation, and that the comprehensive German manual included with the software package was really helpful.
