### "25 standard deviations" quote

On 13 August 2007, The Financial Times reported Viniar's explanation of why two large hedge funds managed by Goldman Sachs had both lost over a quarter of their value in a week, requiring the injection of $3 billion to support them. Viniar ascribed the events to a series of exceptional events: "We were seeing things that were 25 standard deviation moves, several days in a row". This has since been used to illustrate the problems of inappropriate mathematical models in finance, especially those based on the assumption of Normality. Kay & King (2020, p.Â 68) refer to the 'Viniar problem': 'He confused a probability as calculated within a model with a probability in the world of which the model claimed to be a representation. To make a statement about probability in a real world it is necessary to compound the probability derived from the model itself with the probability that the model itself is true. And there is no means of knowing whether the model is true."


### Senate testimony

Viniar testified in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on Tuesday, April 27, 2010 regarding the role of investment banks in the financial crisis that began in 2007 and, specifically, the role of Goldman Sachs in that crisis.
