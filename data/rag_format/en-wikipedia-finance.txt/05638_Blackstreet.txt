# Blackstreet



**Blackstreet** (often stylized as **BLACKstreet**) is an American R&B group founded in 1991 by record producers Chauncey "Black" Hannibal, and Teddy Riley. The group released four albums with Interscope Records between 1994 and 2003. They achieved relative commercial success leading up to their 1996 single "No Diggity" (featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen), which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks.


## History

In 1991 the group was formed by Riley with Chauncey "Black" Hannibal Joseph "Street" Stonestreet and Levi "Lee" Little who were session singers for Bobby Brown's third album *Bobby*, an album that was mostly produced by Riley who recruited them all to be background singers for the album which led them work with writers & producers like Bernard Belle,Walter Mucho Scott, Shock G, Wreckx-N-Effect, The Neptunes,& Tammy Lucas.

They released song for the soundtrack of the Chris Rock film *CB4* which was their first hit called "Baby Be Mine" in 1993 which charted at number one on the top 40 charts and number three on the billboard charts for first three weeks of the songs release. After they finish recording the first half of the album in January of 1994 , Joseph "Street" Stonestreet left the group due to creative differences business & lifestyle disputes with Teddy Riley and was replaced by former Force One Network singer Dave Hollister in 1994. Then they re-recorded "Baby Be Mine" for their self-titled debut, Hollister's vocals were added on the album version of the song.

Their debut album, *Blackstreet*, featured the singles "Booti Call", "Before I Let You Go" and "Joy". "Booti Call" and "Before I Let You Go" were both Top 40 hits, with "Before I Let You Go" hitting the Top 10. In 1996, they released their second album *Another Level*. It was a breakthrough success due to the top single "No Diggity" (with Dr. Dre), which was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1996. In 1998, Blackstreet won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

*Another Level* eventually went four times platinum in the United States and peaked at No. 3 on the *Billboard* chart. "No Diggity" was later ranked at No. 91 on *Rolling Stone* and MTV: 100 Greatest Pop Songs. *Another Level* featured Mark Middleton and Eric Williams in place of Dave Hollister and Levi Little. Both Middleton and Williams were in groups prior to joining Blackstreet. Middleton was part of the short-lived Motown Records group Brik Citi. Williams was part of the trio The Flex, a group that sang on songs produced by their mentor Marley Marl. The success of *Another Level* landed them a guest appearance on Jay-Z's "The City Is Mine" and they teamed with Mýa and Mase for the hit "Take Me There" from the *Rugrats* soundtrack. The success of *Another Level* would also land them a spot on New Edition's 1997 Home Again reunion tour.

Blackstreet had a top ten album with *Finally*. The first single from the album, "Girlfriend/Boyfriend", was a collaboration with Janet Jackson featuring Ja Rule and Eve. Riley recorded a reunion album with Guy in 2000 and subsequently began working on material for his first solo record. Riley had second thoughts about disbanding Blackstreet and patched things up with Hannibal. Middleton and Williams returned to restore the *Another Level* lineup, and Riley's solo project became a Blackstreet reunion. After rumors of legal action and a preemptive countersuit, the group re-banded and released *Level II*.


### Later years

After several failed attempts to keep Blackstreet together, all members eventually continued with solo careers for a time. However, in 2014, it was announced that past members Black, Little, Middleton, and Williams were back together under the Blackstreet moniker. They continue to perform with this lineup currently, and embarked on their second Australian tour in April 2015.

In 2015, Middleton and Williams were backing vocalists for Eurovision Song Contest 2015 North Macedonia entry "Autumn Leaves" performed by Daniel Kajmakoski.

Joseph Stonestreet AKA Street died on June 25, 2018 at the age of 56.
