## History

Ohio Business College was founded in 1903 as Lorain Business College, a private, co-educational college focused on higher adult education. The college was located in downtown Lorain, Ohio. From 1913 to 1980 the school was operated under the management of C. L. Bair. Programs offered included Junior accounting, secretarial, comptometer, stenographic, and keypunch.

In 1980, the Julia Corporation purchased Lorain Business College, and the Lorain campus moved to North Ridge Road in Lorain, Ohio. Curriculum at the time consisted of executive secretarial, business administration, accounting, secretarial, and junior accounting.

On September 27, 1982, Ohio Business College opened a satellite campus in Sandusky, Ohio. The school was located in the Sandusky Plaza, but later moved to the San Marco Plaza off of State Route 250 in Sandusky. In 1993, the Julia Corporation changed the name of both campuses from Lorain Business College to Southeastern Business College to better fit with the schools owned in the southern part of the state.

In October 1997, Tri-State Educational Systems Inc. purchased the colleges from the Julia Corporation and officially changed the name to Ohio Business College in April 1998. In order to accommodate student growth, Tri-State Educational Systems, Inc. relocated both campuses to newly constructed buildings in Sandusky and Sheffield Village, Ohio.

In September 2010, Tri-State Educational Systems, Inc. dissolves Tri-State Semi Driver Training, Inc. and introduces Ohio Business College Truck Driving Academy offering Class A and Class B CDL training for Ohio residents with training sites in Middletown, Ohio.
