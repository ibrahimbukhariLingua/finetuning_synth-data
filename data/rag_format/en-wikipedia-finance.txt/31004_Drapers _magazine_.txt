# Drapers (magazine)



***Drapers*** is a business-to-business magazine and website covering the fashion retail sector. It was founded on 6 August 1887 to cover the women's clothing retail trade, but today spans the whole fashion retail sector, including wider retail issues such as digital transformation, technological advances and the management of supply chains.

Drapers also hosts a series of conferences, events and awards ceremonies throughout the year to recognize the best-performing businesses and to share learnings.

The publication is owned by Metropolis.


## History

*Drapers* was founded on 6 August 1887. Former editors of the magazine and website have included Freddie Offley, Sally Bain, Josephine Collins, Lauretta Roberts, Jessica Brown, Caroline Nodder, Eric Musgrave and Keely Stocker. The current editor is Kirsty McGregor.

In 1961, *Drapers Record* was bought along with the *Illustrated London News*, *Men's Wear* and *Tatler* by the Thomson Corporation and formed into the new Thomson Publications business. Thomson sold *Drapers Record* in 1985, along with the *Illustrated London News*, *Family Circle*, *Living*, and *Construction News*. From 1988 to 1992, it was known as *DR The Fashion Business*, but from 1992 it returned to its original name *Drapers Record*. EMAP acquired the magazine in 1993.

In 2002, *Drapers Record* merged with sister title *Men's Wear*, which had been launched in 1902, to become simply *Drapers*. In November 2006, Emap started making a version of the magazine available digitally every week. The website was relaunched in 2009.

The *Drapers* website was refreshed and re-launched in 2014. The magazine has undergone regular redesigns over the years, with the most recent in January 2017.

Often referred to as the "fashion industry bible", *Drapers* has broken many of the biggest stories impacting the sector and has interviewed many of the key players including Tommy Hilfiger, David Reiss, Alex Baldock, Michael Ward, managing director of Harrods, and Topshop managing director Mary Homer.

It was one of 13 titles acquired from Ascential by Metropolis International in a £23.5m cash deal, announced on 1 June 2017.
