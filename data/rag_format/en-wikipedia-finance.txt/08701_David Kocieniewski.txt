## Acclaim

According to Glenn Kramon – Assistant Managing Editor at The New York Times – Kocieniewski is “a relentless, meticulous, fair-minded reporter with the patience to learn one of the most complicated beats in journalism. Many businesses and wealthy Americans count on the fact that people find taxes too difficult and boring, and therefore won’t be watching when they try questionable means of avoiding them. David helps ensure that attention will be paid.”

According to Charles Kaiser – judge for the Sidney Awards in 2011 when Kocieniewski's article won – this was “a classic piece of investigative reporting. Kocieniewski demonstrates that G.E.’s experience is emblematic of the way more and more giant American corporations have figured out how to reduce their annual tax bills to something close to zero.”
