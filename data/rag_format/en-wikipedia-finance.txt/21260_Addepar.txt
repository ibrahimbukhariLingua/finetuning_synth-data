# Addepar



**Addepar, Inc.** is a cloud based American wealth management software platform for RIAs (registered investment advisors) specializing in data aggregation, analytics, and portfolio reporting. Addepar's clientele is primarily high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and companies.


## History


### Origin

In 2003, Peter Thiel founded Palantir Technologies along with four other founders, including Joe Lonsdale. In 2009, Lonsdale launched Addepar with Jason Mirra, another Palantir employee. One of their earliest clients was Mark Zuckerberg. The company name is based on a line in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* meaning “Add a little to a little and you’ll have a great amount.”.


### Management transition

In 2013, Addepar sought to transition out of start-up mode, replacing Lonsdale with new CEO Eric Poirier previously of Palantir and hiring a COO to start building out the company's management.


### Funding and expansion

In 2017, Addepar received a $140 million round of funding from Valor Equity Partners. The same year, Addepar partnered with Morgan Stanley, providing software that consolidated information and tailored reporting about the assets of high net-worth Morgan Stanley clients.

In May 2017, Addepar acquired AltX, a machine learning platform aimed at alternative investments.

In 2019, Addepar launched a mobile app for its portfolio management software.


## Products and services


### Open API

In September 2016, Salesforce.com announced their partnership with Addepar for Salesforce's Wave Financial Services Cloud for financial advisers, making it easier to see across asset classes and produce a single visual for their clients. One month later, Addepar released their Open API to provide "a programmatic solution to tie Addepar’s data and calculations into a multitude of other products and systems."
