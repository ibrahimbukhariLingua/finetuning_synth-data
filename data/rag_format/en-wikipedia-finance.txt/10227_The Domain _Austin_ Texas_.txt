The Domain (Austin, Texas)


# The Domain (Austin, Texas)



**The Domain** is a high-density office, retail, and residential center in northwest Austin, Texas, United States that has been described as being "Austin's second downtown." It primarily consists of 5-over-1 construction. The initial phase of the project was completed in March 2007.

It is owned and operated by Endeavor Real Estate Group, Cousins Properties, Simon Property Group, and Stonelake Capital Partners. It is bordered on the west by Union Pacific Railroad, on the west and north by Loop 1, on the south by Braker Lane, and on the east by Burnet Road.

As of April 2022, The Domain has more than 5,000 apartment units and about 3.5 million square feet of office space.


## Site history

On December 10, 1966, IBM unveiled its intentions to build a 200,000 sqft manufacturing plant for the IBM Selectric typewriter on the land that currently houses The Domain. The plant opened on July 31, 1967 with 500 employees.

In July 1989, after three decades of expansion in Austin, IBM announced its intentions to build 1 million sqft of office space east of Burnet Rd on the property now known as Broadmoor. By this time IBM occupied 543 acres and had more than 7,000 employees in Austin, the majority of which worked on the IBM PS/2.

In December 1999, IBM sold off 235 acres of land that would eventually become The Domain for US$60 million and leased back more than half of the 2.5 million sqft office space that the property by then had. An additional 70 acres came from Multech (whose land had been purchased from IBM in 1997). Buying the land was Endeavor Real Estate Group with the financial assistance from Blackstone Group and JER Partners. The initial plan had been to create a campus for the dot-com industry but those plans fell through when the dot-com bubble burst.

In 2003, the Simon Property Group and the Endeavor Real Estate Group entered into a collaborative partnership to develop Phase I of The Domain's retail area. 2004 saw the demolition of Century Oaks Park, a multi-purpose recreational facility for IBM employees and their families, and the start of construction on the initial 57 acres (23 ha) Domain: Phase I.

Additional land for The Domain was reclaimed from vacant IBM manufacturing and administrative buildings, as well as driveways and parking lots that were once part of the original IBM campus.

The developers were granted tax subsidies in 2003 from the City of Austin and Travis County. Total developer compensation is a maximum of a net present value of $25 million. The developer keeps 80 percent of the city's sales tax for the first five years and 50 percent for the next 15 years. Plus, 25 percent of the property tax is rebated back to the developer for the entire 20-year period. The city of Austin expects to take in about $40 million in sales and property taxes over the 20 years of the incentive agreement.


## First phase

The first phase of the project, The Domain, opened on March 9, 2007, and includes 700,000 square feet (65,000 m²) of restaurants, office space, upscale retail stores, apartments, and a hotel. The retail portion of the project has attracted many retailers and restaurants new to the Austin market. An 80,000 sq ft (7,400 m²). Neiman Marcus and a Macy's anchor (with Macy's fulfilling an earlier commitment by Foley's), along with 70 specialty stores, including an Apple Store, a Barneys New York CO-OP store, Burberry, Victoria's Secret, Tiffany & Co., BCBG Max Azria, Calypso Christiane Celle, Anne Fontaine, Lacoste, Lilly Pulitzer, Betty Sport, and a Microsoft store. The shopping center notably is also one of the short list of locations containing outlets for two new store concepts — Abercrombie & Fitch Co.'s RUEHL 925, targeting affluent young professionals, and American Eagle Outfitters' adventure-oriented Martin + Osa. Both of those stores had closed as of late 2010, and have become locations for Anthropologie (in the former Ruehl location), and Lids (in the former Martin + Osa location). Restaurants include McCormick & Schmick's, Fleming's, Daily Grill, Jasper's, Kona Grill, The Steeping Room, and California Pizza Kitchen.


## Second phase and additional expansion

After the Simon Property Group acquired the 45 acres (18 ha) property that would become The Domain II (Domain Crossing) they bought Endeavor's portion of The Domain I. This second phase, located directly south of The Domain, opened in 2016.

Domain Crossing added an additional 350,000 square feet (33,000 m²) of retail stores, restaurants, and apartments, as well as a theater - Gold Class Cinema - and other entertainment options.

Simon Property Group announced that a 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m²), three-story Dillard's would open during spring 2009 in the primary portion of the project. Nordstrom signed a letter of intent for a two-story, 149,000-square-foot (13,800 m²) store to open in The Domain's phase III. Saks Fifth Avenue also signed a letter of intent for Phase III.

Whole Foods opened a 55,000 square feet (5,100 m²) square foot location in The Domain in January 2014.

Simon Property Group opened up a "great lawn venue" in Phase 2 that hosts live bands from 6 to 9pm on weekends, and food trucks.


## Third phase

The Domain's third phase consists of 1.4 million square feet of retail, residential and hotel space.

## Opposition

Austin businessman and civic activist, Brian Rodgers, leader of Stop Domain Subsidies, sued the City of Austin and Endeavor Real Estate Group in 2004, claiming Endeavor purposely misled the city in order to receive what he argued amounted to $65 million in tax subsidies. The suit was settled out of court, with the settlement allowing the City of Austin to back out of deal with no penalties. Eventually, the local newspaper verified that the original claim that the subsidy was only $25 million was false and that, according to their figures, it could amount to $57 million.

Stop Domain Subsidies launched a petition drive in 2007 to put an initiative on the city ballot to stop the city from granting any city tax subsidies for developments with retail uses. The charter amendment, which would have prevented the city from giving tax incentives to retail projects, appeared on the ballot for the November 2008 election as Proposition 2, but was ultimately narrowly defeated at 48%.

In the run-up to the election, in September 2008, a political action committee named Keep Austin's Word was started by Betty Dunkerley, a former member of the Austin City Council. The group, named to resemble the slogan "Keep Austin Weird", was primarily funded by the developers of The Domain, including Simon Properties, the largest mall developer in the United States. Then Austin Mayor, Will Wynn, appeared on TV ads paid for by the Keep Austin's Word PAC, to the tune of nearly $400,000, urging that Austin "keep its word."ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Another citizen's petition drive in 2012 in Austin passed, replacing Austin's all at-large voting system to single-member districts (geographic representation) and Austin's independent citizens commission (ICRC) to draw the lines. The ICRC remains the only one as of 2021 in Texas.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
