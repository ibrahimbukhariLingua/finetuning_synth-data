Department of Economic Development, Tourism and the Arts


# Department of Economic Development, Tourism and the Arts



The **Department of Economic Development, Tourism and the Arts** (DEDTA) was the Tasmanian Government department tasked with making Tasmania a prosperous, vibrant, and healthy community. The department's core mission was to lead industry and community development, implement marketing and development programs for Tasmanian tourism, and provide policy and planning for the arts and culture sectors.

DEDTA was the initial point of contact for companies wishing to establish, relocate, diversify, or expand in Tasmania. It facilitated connections between government entities and the private sector to market Tasmania's unique attributes, provided funding for events, artists, and arts organizations, supported the upkeep of the state's cultural heritage collections, and promoted opportunities for all Tasmanians to engage in sports, recreation, and physical activities.

On 1 July 2014, DEDTA was merged with the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources, forming the Department of State Growth.
