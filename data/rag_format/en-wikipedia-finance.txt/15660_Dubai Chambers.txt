Dubai Chambers’ key responsibilities include delivering value-added services to the business community, driving effective advocacy to enhance Dubai’s business environment, strengthening international trade, assisting local companies to expand into new global markets, and attracting foreign businesses and investments to Dubai.


## Overview

Dubai Chambers provides a comprehensive support to members of Dubai Chamber of Commerce through essential trade documents, business services, policy advocacy, and networking opportunities. The organisation oversees programmes and initiatives designed to strengthen international partnerships, advance global trade, and accelerate the growth of the digital economy.


## History

The roots of Dubai Chambers can be traced back to 1965, when Dubai Chamber of Commerce was established. Over the past six decades, the organisation has evolved significantly to enable businesses to maximise the opportunities created by Dubai's accelerated development as one of the world’s fastest-growing cities.
Dubai Chambers was restructured in 2021 to support the emirate's plans to boost non-oil foreign trade to AED 2 trillion by 2025 and reinforce Dubai's position as a dynamic global business hub. The organisation now encompass three highly focused entities: Dubai Chamber of Commerce, Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy, and Dubai International Chamber.

Together, these entities drive the growth of the local business community, foster international collaborations, and accelerate the growth of the digital economy, ensuring Dubai remains a premier destination for business, trade, and investment.


## Structure

Dubai Chambers operates as an umbrella organisation overseeing three distinct chambers:

* Dubai Chamber of Commerce represents, supports, and protects the interests of Dubai's business community while promoting the emirate as a highly competitive commercial hub. It serves as a bridge between the business community and Dubai's government, acting as a powerful advocate for the emirate's business interests.
* Dubai International Chamber enables Dubai-based businesses to expand into global markets, while attracting foreign direct investments into the emirate. The chamber is supported by a network of more than 30 international representative offices worldwide.
* Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy aims to position the emirate as one of the world's most agile and diversified technology-enabled digital hubs.

In addition to operating as individual entities, the three chambers work collaboratively to achieve their shared objectives and enhance Dubai’s position as a global hub for business, trade, and investment.
