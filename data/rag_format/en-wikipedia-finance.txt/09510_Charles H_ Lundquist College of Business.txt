## About

The Lundquist College of Business draws strength from its links to the Pacific Rim and the distinctive qualities of Oregon culture: innovation, sustainability, active lifestyles, and financial stewardship.

The college is accredited through the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Roughly 5% of the world's business schools have this accreditation. Additionally, the accounting program is also accredited though AACSB.

The college is housed in the Lillis Business Complex. Completed in 2003, the facility's then state-of-the-art lighting system was once featured in a Wall Street Journal article. The college's current dean is Bruce Blonigen. Blonigen joined the Lundquist College as dean on July 15, 2022.

The college is home to four centers of excellence (Center for Sustainable Business Practices, James H. Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship, and Cameron Center for Finance and Securities Analysis) that advance an "experiential learning" approach to business education. The Warsaw Sports Marketing Center was the first program of its kind housed within a U.S. college of business. Founded in 1993, the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center provides a platform for both research and education focused on the $500 billion sports business industry. The most recent *Sports Business* global rankings of sports master's programs published in September 2021, placed the Oregon MBA's sports business track (coordinated by the Warsaw Center) among the top seven programs in the world.

Each year, the college's Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship presents the New Venture Championship, an investment competition for graduate students that draws competitors from all over the world.

The Department of Accounting offers a one-year Masters of Accounting (MAcc) program allowing accounting students to earn enough credits for CPA eligibility in the State of Oregon. In addition, the Beta Alpha Psi Chapter is the second oldest in the nation.
