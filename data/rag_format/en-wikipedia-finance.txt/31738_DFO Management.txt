## Founding and management

In 1998, Michael Dell recruited John C. Phelan and Glenn R. Fuhrman to form MSD Capital to manage his family's wealth.

Phelan continued as chief investment officer until his retirement in June 2022.

In December 2022, MSD Capital was restructured to form DFO Management.
