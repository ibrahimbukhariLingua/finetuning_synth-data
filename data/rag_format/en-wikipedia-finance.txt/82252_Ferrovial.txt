## History


### 20th century

Ferrovial was founded by Rafael del Pino y Moreno in 1952 as a company focused on railway construction. Its first works consisted of the renovation of tracks for Renfe and operating railroad tie sleeper workshops.

The company received its first international project, a railway project in Venezuela, in 1954. Two years later, it renovated the railway between Bilbao and Portugalete.

In the 1960s, Ferrovial focused on the road market through the Redia Plan11 and the concession of the Bilbao-Behobia Highway, the first toll road tendered with private financing and management in Spain. During 1974, the company obtained its second concession in Spain, the Burgos-Armiñón highway, which linked Burgos with Bilbao and the French border of Behobia. In the late 1970s, it began building 700 kilometers of roads in Libya, with completion in 1986.

In 1985, Ferrovial acquired Cadagua, an engineering and construction company for water treatment plants established in 1971. It was began building the High-Speed Train between Madrid and Seville, as well as numerous infrastructure projects for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona and the World Expo of Seville in 1992.

By following the internationalization and diversification strategy, Ferrovial acquired a 20% share in the Sydney Airport in the airport sector in 2002. One years later, it also acquired two urban services companies, the British company Amey and Spanish company Cespa.

## Criticism


### The Palau Case

As part of the Palau Case investigation, Anti-Corruption discovered "sufficient evidence" of Ferrovial Agroman paying illicit commissions to the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) party through the Palau de la Música Catalana to ensure that public works such as the City of Justice and the unfinished line 9 of the Barcelona Metro station would be awarded to them.

On 15 January 2018, the Provincial Court of Barcelona issued a judgment in the Palau Case, acquitting the two executives related to Ferrovial Agroman. The prosecution appealed that acquittal, but the appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
