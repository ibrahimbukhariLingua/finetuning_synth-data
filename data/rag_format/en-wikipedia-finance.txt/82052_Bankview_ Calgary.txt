# Bankview, Calgary



**Bankview** is a neighbourhood in the southwest quadrant of the city of Calgary, Alberta.

The neighbourhood is bounded by 17th Avenue SW on the north, 26th Avenue SW on the south, 14th Street SW on the east and 19th Street SW on the west. It is a residential neighbourhood located southwest of the high density Beltline district of the inner city.


## History

William Nimmons purchased the lands of the present day Bankview neighbourhood from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1882, for ranching and farming. He established the *3-D-Bar Ranch* on these lands, and later a sandstone quarry and a theater (the *Mount Royal Theatre*). The Nimmons residence, built in 1884, is now a heritage building, and still stands in the northeast corner of Bankview.

By 1902, during a housing shortage due to 1900s economic boom, Nimmons divided the land, and begun selling plots to newly arrived settlers. In 1908, the remainder of the land was bought by the City of Calgary, and was divided in the traditional grid system.

Bankview was established as a neighbourhood in 1908. The district saw a major redesign in 1950, allowing for higher density apartment buildings and the community now has an area redevelopment plan in place.
