Communitybuilders


# Communitybuilders



**Communitybuilders** is a Â£70 million programme in the United Kingdom that aims to strengthen the resilience of multi-purpose, inclusive community-led organisations that operate at the neighbourhood level (sometimes referred to as community anchors).


## Background

Government responsibility for Communitybuilders lies jointly with the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Office of the Third Sector.

In June 2009, a consortium, led by the Adventure Capital Fund (ACF) and including Futurebuilders England and the Community Alliance (Development Trusts Association, BASSAC and Community Matters) was appointed to deliver the programme.


## Purpose

Communitybuilders takes forward a commitment within the *Communities in Control: Real People, Real Power* white paper to build more cohesive, empowered and active communities.

The aim of the Communitybuilders programme is to help community anchor organisations work towards long-term financial stability so they can meet the needs of their communities for generations to come. Communitybuilders provides a mix of loans, grants and non-financial support at different stages of the project cycle, supporting both existing organisations and newly formed organisations
