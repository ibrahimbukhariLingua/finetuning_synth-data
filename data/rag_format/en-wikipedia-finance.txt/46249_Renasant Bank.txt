## History

Renasant began as The Peoples Bank and Trust Company in 1904. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the bank grew by acquiring small local banks in Mississippi. In 2005, it acquired Heritage Bank of Decatur, Alabama, and Renasant Bancshares of Memphis, Tennessee and assumed the new Renasant Bank moniker. In 2007, Renasant acquired Capital Bank of Nashville, Tennessee. In 2010, as part of the financial crisis, it acquired the failed Crescent Bank and Trust of Jasper, Georgia and later the American Trust Bank of Roswell, Georgia, both suburban Atlanta banks. Additional acquisitions followed in the 2010s, Merchants and Farmers Bank of Kosciusko, Mississippi in 2013, Heritage Bank of the South in Albany, Georgia, in 2015, and Keyworth Bank of Johns Creek, Georgia. In the third quarter of 2018, Renasant acquired BrandBank of Lawrenceville, Georgia, adding 13 more locations. In 2024, Renasant Corporation and The First Bancshares, Inc. headquartered in Hattiesburg, Mississippi jointly announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger, pursuant to which The First will merge with and into Renasant in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $1.2 billion. The Merger will create a six-state Southeastern banking franchise with approximately $25 billion in total assets, $18 billion in total loans and $21 billion in total deposits and add an additional 116 locations.
