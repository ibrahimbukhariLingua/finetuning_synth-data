Renewable energy in Belarus


# Renewable energy in Belarus




As of 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, there is little renewable energy in Belarus. 7% of primary energy in Belarus was from renewables in 2019, mostly biofuels.⁴⁰ As there is a lot of district heating, more renewables could be integrated into the heat distribution system,⁴⁴ but this is hindered by fossil fuel subsidies.⁶²


## Policy

A 2021 study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) recommended:¹¹–¹⁴

1. Revising renewable energy targets
2. Improving the quota allocation for renewables
3. Designing renewable energy auctions
4. Harnessing renewable energy potentials in heating
5. Developing an energy sector master plan with higher shares of renewables
6. Adopting a grid code for renewables
7. Improving variable renewable power generation forecasting
8. Improving de-risking mechanisms for renewable energy investments
9. Standardising power purchase agreements
10. Building human and institutional capacities for renewable energy development

## Producers

About half of the energy is produced by independent power producers.³⁴


## Economics

In 2019, energy imports cost 5.5% of the national GDP, which could be reduced by increasing renewable energy production. According to IRENA, increasing renewable energy production would also create jobs and increase energy security.


## Sources of energy


### Biomass

There is large potential from wood waste, crop residue, and biogas from manure;⁴⁰–⁴¹ About 10% of district heating is biomass.²⁹


### Solar power


### Wind power


### Geothermal

Although the crust below Belarus is not hot enough for electricity generation it may be possible to integrate geothermal energy into district heating.⁴⁴


### Hydroelectricity

Although small hydroelectric power plants were common before the national grid, there is now less than 100MW produced, since Belarus is mostly flat.³⁰
