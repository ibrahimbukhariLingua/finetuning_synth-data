Reform Scotland


# Reform Scotland



**Reform Scotland** is a Scottish think tank based in Edinburgh. Established in 2008, Reform Scotland is the successor to think tank Policy Institute (1999–2008).

Reform Scotland is a company limited by guarantee (No SC336414) and a Scottish charity (No SC039624) funded by individuals, charitable trusts, companies and organisations that share its aims.

In November 2022, the funding transparency website Who Funds You? rated Reform Scotland as E, the lowest transparency rating (rating goes from A to E).

Reform Scotland made a submission to the Scotland Bill Committee, based upon their pamphlet advocating Devolution Plus. Devolution Plus is a system whereby the Scottish devolution settlement would be amended to see both the Scottish Parliament and Westminster parliament raising sufficient revenue in taxation to fund their own spending. That submission was the basis of the foundation of the Devo Plus group, to promote the idea during the run up to a referendum on Scottish independence.

In 2012 Reform Scotland won 'one to watch' at Prospect magazine's annual think tank awards in London as well as runner up in the economic and financial category.
