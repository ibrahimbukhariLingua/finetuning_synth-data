It was founded in 1933 as Belarusian Institute for National Economy. It was renamed Belarus State Economic University (**BSEU**) in January 1992.

Students from more than 27 countries study at BSEU. BSEU has «double diploma» programs with universities of Russia and China.


## History

BSEU is one of the oldest universities in the country. The growing need of the state for educated specialists was reflected in the resolution of the November 1929 Plenum of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks «On the Personnel of the National Economy». It stated the need to improve the training of economists of various profiles. Already in 1930 an independent Faculty of National Economy was established with five departments: industrial, agricultural, planning and statistical, financial and co-operative. At that time the faculty had 300 students, and in 1931 there were more than 700 students.

On the basis of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the BSU, three independent institutes were established in accordance with the Resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) No. 215 of 7 July 1931: the Institute of Planning and Economics, the Institute of Finance and Economics, and the Institute of Consumer Cooperation (Cooperative Institute) of different administrative subordination. These institutes existed for about two years. However, there was a lack of experienced economic personnel, as specialists were scattered throughout the country (from Brest to Kamchatka and the Far East).

On the basis of the decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the BSSR No. 721 of 20 May 1933, the Belarusian State Institute of National Economy (BSINE) was established on the basis of the three above-mentioned institutes. It and its working faculty were approved by Gosplan of the BSSR in the autumn of the same year. On 20 January 1935, the government of the BSSR gave the institute the name of Kuibyshev.

On 22 June 1941 the Second World War began and BSINE stopped its work.

Former directors of BSINE P.A.Balabanov, A.V.Gurlo, I.L.Satsunkevich, professor N.V.Dembinsky, associate professors S.V.Elison, T.A.Zarubin, I.F.Kruk, A.I.Petukhov and other teachers and graduates of the institute fought in the ranks of the Red Army, in partisan detachments and underground groups. Many employees of the «Narkhoz» made their contribution to the approaching hour of liberation of the Motherland. In July 1944 the capital of Soviet Belarus was liberated from the Nazi invaders. During the Second World War the educational buildings of the Institute were destroyed, their contents were mostly destroyed. On 28 October 1944, in accordance with the decree of the Council of People's Commissars, the institute resumed its activity. The first post-war admission committee of BSINE started its work on 25 January 1945. In February the first post-war enrolment of 58 students took place. Regular classes began on 1 March 1945 in the evening shift in the building of the secondary school.

The first post-war educational building was opened between 1950 and 1954

On 20 January 1992, the V.V. Kuibyshev Belarusian State Institute of National Economy was transformed into the Belarusian State University of Economics by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No. 21.

The Belarusian State University received state certification and accreditation for the first time in 1995. It confirmed its status as the leading educational institution in the national system of training economic personnel in 1996.

## Criticism, accusations of political repressions

In late 2005, Tatsiana Khoma, a fourth-year A-student of the International Economic Relations Faculty, was expelled from the BSEU after participating in a conference of ESIB, a pan-European student organization, where she was elected member of the organization's leadership. The expulsion caused wide international protest and concerns from Sweden's education minister Leif Pagrotsky. The European University Association has frozen its cooperation with the BSEU following the scandal. BSEU students close to Tatsiana Khoma and those involved in civic activities were intimidated by the university's administration and the KGB.

In 2006, after mass protests against president Lukashenka that followed a controversial presidential election, BSEU students that were identified among protesters were forced, under threat of expulsion, to publicly repent and denounce the protests.

In 2008, human rights organisations have added BSEU rector Uladzimir Shymau (Vladimir Shimov) to a list of officials of the regime of president Alexander Lukashenko responsible for human rights violations. Shymau was listed among rectors of several universities from where students were expelled on political grounds.

In 2020, during the mass protests that followed another presidential election, the administration of the BSEU has reportedly filed a list of the university's students who participated in the protests to the police and requested measures to be taken against them. Several students were expelled from BSEU for participating in protests. The dean of one of the faculties was fired for expressing his political opinion and protecting student protesters.

On 21 June 2021, Siarhei Skryba, Vice Chancellor of the BSEU for Educational Work, was added to the sanctions list of the European Union. According to the official decision of the EU, "in his position as Vice Chancellor of the Belarusian State Economic University (BSEU) for educational work, Siarhei Skryba is responsible for sanctions taken against students for their participation in peaceful protests, including their expulsion from university. Some of these sanctions were taken following Lukashenka's call on 27 October 2020 for expelling from universities students taking part in protests and strikes."
