## Detailed list of projects for 2016

**Terminology**

* **Year Startup**: year of first oil. put specific date if available.
* **Operator**: company undertaking the project.
* **Area**: onshore (LAND), offshore (OFF), offshore deep water (ODW), tar sands (TAR).
* **Type**: liquid category (i.e. Natural Gas Liquids, Natural gas condensate, Crude oil)
* **Grade**: oil quality (light, medium, heavy, sour) or API gravity
* **2P resvs**: 2P (proven + probable) oil reserves in giga barrels (Gb).
* **GOR**: The ratio of produced gas to produced oil, commonly abbreviated GOR.
* **Peak year**: year of the production plateau/peak.
* **Peak**: maximum production expected (thousand barrels/day).
* **Discovery**: year of discovery.
* **Capital investment**: expected capital cost; FID (Final Investment Decision) - If no FID, then normally no project development contracts can be awarded. For many projects, a FEED stage (Front End Engineering Design) precedes the FID.
* **Notes**: comments about the project (footnotes).
* **Ref**: list of sources.
