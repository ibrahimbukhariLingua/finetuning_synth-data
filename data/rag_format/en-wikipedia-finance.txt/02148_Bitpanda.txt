## History


### Founding and Orientation

The company was founded in 2014 by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek, and Christian Trummer. In the early days, Bitpanda was a platform on which only cryptocurrencies were traded. Initially, the company operated under the name Coinimal GmbH, while the cryptocurrency trading platform was always known as Bitpanda. From 2017 onwards, vouchers for Bitcoins could be purchased at over 1,800 locations of the Österreichische Post, which could be redeemed on the Bitpanda platform. In 2017, 15 employees achieved a net profit of USD 12.49 million and processed transactions with various cryptocurrencies amounting to USD 672 million. In 2018, the company was renamed Bitpanda GmbH. In 2018, an office was opened in London.


### Diversification of Services

In summer 2019, Bitpanda launched a token called *Best*, which offered a discount on trading fees for payments. In the same year, the company began integrating precious metal trading into its platform.

In September 2020, the company raised USD 58.2 million in an initial funding round. Investors included Peter Thiel's investment firm. In a second investment round, Bitpanda raised a total of USD 160 million, increasing the company's valuation to USD 1.2 billion in March 2021. The main investors in this round were Valar Ventures and partners of DST Global. This made the company the first Austrian start-up to meet the criteria for unicorn status.

In early 2021, the company partnered with Visa to introduce a debit card that could be used to pay for goods and services in cryptocurrency or commodities in stores. In April 2021, it received a license for securities trading, allowing investments in fractional shares and ETFs.

In another round of funding in August 2021, the company raised USD 263 million, increasing its valuation to more than USD 4 billion. In this latest round, Valar Ventures, Alan Howard, and Redo Ventures participated again, along with existing investors LeadBlock Partners and Jump Capital.


### Cuts, Licensing, and Expansion

Due to overly rapid growth with numerous new hires and the 70% decline in Bitcoin's price, Bitpanda laid off 35% of its workforce on June 24, 2022.

In July 2021, the company announced it would open an office in Berlin. By the end of the year, Bitpanda received a crypto license from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which not only allows for the custody of cryptocurrencies but also enables proprietary trading with them.

Since 2023, Bitpanda has been operating a branch in the UK and began a partnership with Coinbase to provide institutional clients with a regulated trading infrastructure. Additionally, the company invested USD 10.27 million in artificial intelligence development. Through a collaboration with N26 Bank, Bitpanda's cryptocurrency trading platform was integrated into the N26 app, allowing bank customers to trade over 200 cryptocurrencies via the app. Furthermore, since April 2023, Bitpanda has been partnering with Raiffeisenbank Niederösterreich-Wien, giving customers access to Bitpanda's cryptocurrency trading services through the bank's own platform.

Since 2023, Deutsche Bank has served as the European bank for Bitpanda's cross-border services in Austria and Spain. In April 2024, Bitpanda announced a collaboration with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) to enable LBBW corporate clients to custody and procure cryptocurrencies. In early June, Bitpanda expanded its partnership with Deutsche Bank to offer real-time payments for incoming and outgoing transactions.
