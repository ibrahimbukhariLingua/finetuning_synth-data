CPF number


# CPF number



The **CPF number** (**Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas**, [sepeˈɛfi]; Portuguese for "*Physical Persons Register*") is the Brazilian individual taxpayer registry, since its creation in 1965. This number is attributed by the Brazilian Federal Revenue to Brazilians and resident aliens who, directly or indirectly, pay taxes in Brazil. It's an 11-digit number in the format 000.000.000-00, where the last 2 numbers are check digits, generated through an arithmetic operation on the first nine digits.

In May 2020, a digital version of the document was promoted for Android and iOS.

In June 2020, an audit from the Tribunal de Contas da União (*Federal Court of Accounts*, often referred to as TCU) revealed that there were at least 12.5 million CPFs more than the total population.

During COVID-19 pandemic the Revenue reported 223.8 million active CPFs, the problem is that, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the Brazilian population at the time of the survey was around 211.4 million people, updated to 211.8 million at the end of August.

Auditors revealed that there was evidence that an individual was already dead in 3.3 million valid entries and more than 78,000 active CPFs of people over 110 years old. International surveys show that there are only 29 people in this age group in the world – and only one lives in Brazil.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, all requests for CPF from new foreign residents are being taken virtually.

Foreign residents can request a CPF online or at an embassy or consulate, when available. The online form is available in Spanish and English. Foreign residents can also check the nearest diplomatic mission representation abroad and its working hours: , , ,
