Coega


# Coega



The **Coega** Special Economic Zone (SEZ), established in 1999 and 9 003 ha in extent, is situated near Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The initiative is a multibillion-dollar industrial development complex customised for heavy, medium and light industries, and adjacent to a deep-water port, the Port of Ngqura. The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) is the developer and operator of the Coega SEZ and is responsible for the land side infrastructure, while the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) develops the deep-water port facility, the Port of Ngqura.


## Structure

The Coega SEZ is a phased development around industry clusters with Custom Control Areas dedicated for export-oriented manufacturing for companies located in the zone. Coega offers a platform for global exports by attracting foreign and local investment in manufacturing industries. A strategic development framework plan for the Coega SEZ has been developed, focusing on infrastructure development and facilities for the core development area, which comprises 65 km². The Coega SEZ is demarcated into 14 zones and is specifically designed along the cluster model linking related industries from the commercial cluster, logistics cluster to automotive cluster, and energy cluster.

The Coega SEZ was developed to attract investment from the automotive, agro-processing, chemicals, energy, general manufacturing, metals, and business process outsourcing.


## Port of Ngqura

The Port of Ngqura is a deep-water port adjacent to Coega SEZ, 20 km northeast of Gqeberha on the east coast (Indian Ocean) of South Africa. The deep-water port, with a depth of between 16m and 18m, cost R10 billion and became operational in 2009. The Port assists the Coega SEZ as a means of transporting equipment and manufactured products in and out of the country.


## Laydown area

Between Coega SEZ and Ngqura Port is a 12-hectare laydown area designed to be a temporary storage site for abnormal cargo. The project which cost R9 million, was started in 2014 and started operating in April 2015.
