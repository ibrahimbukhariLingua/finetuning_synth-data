### Investments

In 2006 Highbridge invested as a joint venture in Louis Dreyfus Company to increase its access to and control of energy delivery within trading markets. The joint venture was called Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy LLC (LDH Energy). In October 2012 Highbridge exited the position as it was announced that Glenn Dubin, Paul Tudor Jones and Timothy Barakett were among a group of investors buying the merchant energy operation Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy ("LDH Energy") from Louis Dreyfus and Highbridge. The reason for Louis Dreyfus to sell LDH Energy was it sought to raise capital to expand its agriculture trading business. The new company was named Castleton Commodities International, LLC where Dubin as of 2012 is the lead shareholder.

Following the Highbridge/J.P. Morgan partnership, Highbridge announced in October 2010 the purchase of a majority interest in Gávea Investimentos, a leading alternative-asset management company in Brazil. Gávea was co-founded in 2003 by Chairman and Chief Investment Officer Arminio Fraga, former President of the Central Bank of Brazil.
