## Personal life

Schafferer finished his Matura at the Reithmannstra√üe secondary school and moved on to study law at the University of Innsbruck.

## Career

He founded the PEMA Immobilien GmbH in 2005 and acquired as his first big project the Brenner Outlet Center together with the Huter Family. His company realized three towers in Innsbruck, the Headline, P2 and P3, which is still under construction.

Since the founding of PEMA, Schafferer has been involved in several major real estate projects, f. e. the old *Creditanstalt-Bankverein* building at the Schottenring in Vienna. He was therefore consulted several times by the media as a real estate expert to talk about topics such as the housing situation in Vienna and Innsbruck.

Under his leadership, PEMA has developed real estate projects with a total volume of more than 750 million euros in Austria, Germany and South Tyrol since its foundation in 2005.
