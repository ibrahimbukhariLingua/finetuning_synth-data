## Writing

His books include *The Loyalty Effect* (1996), *Loyalty Rules!* (2001), and *The Ultimate Question: Driving Good Profits and True Growth* (2006). He has authored articles for business publications, including eight for the *Harvard Business Review*. He speaks on loyalty and other business topics at management conferences and similar events. His work on loyalty has been covered in The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Financial Times, Fortune, Business Week and The Economist.

His 2011 book, *The Ultimate Question 2.0: How Net Promoter Companies Thrive in a Customer-Driven World*, was a New York Times Bestseller and co-authored by long-time collaborator, Rob Markey of Bain & Company. An updated and expanded version of his 2006 book, *The Ultimate Question*, it focuses on Net Promoter Score (NPS), a concept he developed based on his research in measuring customer satisfaction, customer retention and its link to revenue growth and profitability. This metric serves as an indicator of the loyalty and advocacy customers show for a company. In this new version of the book, Reichheld renames NPS the "Net Promoter system" to emphasize elements of the approach beyond the metric.

In 2021, Reichheld published a new book entitled "Winning on Purpose", along with two co-authors Darci Darnell and Maureen Burns. Topics include Net Promoter 3.0, and Fred's latest invention, called "Earned Growth", described as an accounting-based twin for Net Promoter Score.
