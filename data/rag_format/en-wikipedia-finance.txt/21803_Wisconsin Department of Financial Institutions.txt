Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions


# Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions



The **Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions** (**DFI**) is an agency of the Wisconsin state government responsible for state regulation of financial institutions and educating the public about financial issues.

The department headquarters are located at the Hill Farms State Office Building on the west side of Madison, Wisconsin. The current secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Revenue is Kathy Blumenfeld. She was appointed by Governor Tony Evers in January 2019.


## History

The Constitution of Wisconsin, approved in 1848, specified in Article XI, Sections 4 and 5, that no banking law could be enacted in the state without a statewide amendment ratifying the change. Under this procedure, in 1852, the Wisconsin Legislature passed 1852 Wisc. Act 479 which first authorized the establishment of banks in the state and created the Office of Bank Comptroller—a statewide elected official empowered to oversee and regulate the issuance of bank notes. The act was ratified by referendum in the Spring of 1853, and the first State Bank Comptroller, James S. Baker, was appointed by Governor Leonard J. Farwell.

The Bank Comptroller was abolished in 1868 and its responsibilities transferred to a bank examiner in the Office of the State Treasurer of Wisconsin, where those duties remained until 1903. In 1902, Wisconsin voters approved an amendment to the State Constitution significantly altering Article XI, Section 4, to allow more flexibility for the Legislature in regulating banks. The 1903 Legislature then passed 1903 Wisc. Act 234, which established a State Banking Department. Regulation of securities and credit unions were introduced in 1913 with 1913 Wisc. Act 733 and 1913 Wisc. Act 756. Credit union regulation was assigned to the State Banking Department; regulation of securities, however, was assigned to the State Railroad Commission until 1939, when a State Department of Securities was established (1939 Wisc. Act 68).

The next major evolution occurred in the 1967 executive branch reorganization, which abolished the State Banking Department and the Department of Securities, creating a Commissioner for Banking and Commissioner for Securities. A separate Commissioner of Credit Unions was created in 1971.

The current Department of Financial Institutions was created by 1995 Wisc. Act 27. The commissioners for banking, securities, and credit unions were absorbed as separate divisions within the new state agency.
