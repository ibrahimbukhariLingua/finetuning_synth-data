## History

In May 2012, Future Group announced a 50.1% stake sale of its fashion chain Pantaloons to Aditya Birla Group in order to reduce its debt of around ₹8,000 crore (equivalent to ₹150 billion or US$1.7 billion in 2023). To do so, the Pantaloons fashion segment was demerged from Pantaloons Retail India Ltd, which was then merged into subsidiary Future Value Retail Ltd and later renamed Future Retail Ltd.

On 21 November 2014, Future Consumer Enterprises Limited acquired 98% of Nilgris from Actis Capital and other promoters. With that, Nilgiris is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Future Consumer Enterprises Limited (FCEL).

In May 2015, Future Group acquired Bharti Retail in a deal worth around ₹500 crore (equivalent to ₹755 crore or US$87 million in 2023). Bharti Retail operated 216 convenience stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets under the brand name Easyday. Following the acquisition, Bharti Enterprises received 9% stakes in Future Retail Limited (manages retail operations) and Future Enterprises Limited (manages infrastructure, investments and assets).

In August 2019, Amazon acquired a 49% stake in Future Coupons, and indirectly obtained a 3.5% minority stake in Future Retail, ahead of an option to buy all or part of the promoters' holding in the company.

In August 2020, it was announced that Reliance Retail had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter's retail and wholesale businesses and its logistics and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion.

The merger between Reliance Retail and Future Group was halted in October 2020, after Amazon filed a plea in the High Court for enforcement of EA awarded by the Singapore International Arbitration Center. In August 2021, the Supreme Court of India upheld Amazon's plea to restrain the merger. In December 2021, the CCI withdrew its approval for Amazon's acquisition of a minority stake in Future Coupons, stating that Amazon had misled the regulator about the purpose of its investment in the Future Group company.
