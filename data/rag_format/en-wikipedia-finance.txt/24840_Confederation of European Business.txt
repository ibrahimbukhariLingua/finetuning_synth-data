Confederation of European Business


# Confederation of European Business



The **Confederation of European Business**, shortened as **BusinessEurope**, is a lobby group representing enterprises of all sizes in the European Union (EU) and seven non-EU European countries. It is made up of 40 national industry and employers' organizations. The current president of the confederation is Fredrik Persson, while the Director General is Markus J. Beyrer.

Based in Brussels, the confederation is officially recognised as a social partner at European level, is involved in a range of economic and social decisions and cooperates with a number of stakeholders and business partners. It promotes the interests of corporate citizens to ensure that public policy supports the European economy. It is generally considered the strongest interest organisation in Brussels and represents 20 million companies through its member trade associations in 36 European countries.


## History

In 2014, Unilever terminated its membership in BusinessEurope's Advisory and Support Group because it opposed the organisation's stance on carbon dioxide emissions.
