Back in Chile, Eyzaguirre became acquainted with and befriended Ricardo Lagos, with whom he later joined the Party for Democracy, his current party affiliation.

### Political career

On 11 March 2000, he took the oath as Minister of Finance in the government of Ricardo Lagos. The Lagos government's policy was to perpetuate and perfect Chile's free market economy by drawing lessons for the Asian crisis, which had left Chile with persistently high unemployment and low growth. It balanced the fiscal accounts and implemented a fiscal rule based on the structural balance, which strengthened the fiscal position and contributed to inflation reaching historical lows. The increased macroeconomic stability fostered a return to better economic performance, with growth reaching 6% by 2004. Eyzaguirre's six-year term makes him the longest-serving Minister of Finance in the history of Chile.

Under his tenure the state owned mining company, Codelco, closed copper forward trades with the Chinese government. Those transactions generated losses of almost US$5.0 bn for the Chilean government. The internal revenue service of Chile (SII) questioned de operations because copper was sold at an average of usd1,16 per pound, while in the London Exchange was trading at US$3,87.


## Views on economics and political positions

The concept of extractivism has been criticized by Eyzaguirre, who cites the mining sector of Australia as a successful example of a "deep and sophisticated value chain", with high human capital, self-produced machinery and associated top-tier scientific research. For the case of Chile Eyzaguirre argue that rentierism and not extractivism should be concept of concern.

Eyzaguirre supported the proposed new political constitution in the 2022 Chilean national plebiscite.
