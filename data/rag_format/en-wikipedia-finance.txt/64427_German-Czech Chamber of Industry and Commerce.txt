In the following year, the DTIHK moved to their new offices at Wenceslas Square. In 2010, the service society AHK Services s.r.o. was founded as a wholly owned subsidiary. One year later, the DTIHK signed a cooperation agreement to open a shared regional office in Plzeň with the IHK Regensburg for Upper Palatinate/Kehlheim. In 2013, the chamber celebrated its 20th anniversary.
