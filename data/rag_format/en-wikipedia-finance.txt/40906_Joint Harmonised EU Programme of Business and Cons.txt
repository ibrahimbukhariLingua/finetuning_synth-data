Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys


# Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys



**The Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys** consists of economic tendency surveys which are conducted in all EU Member States and candidate countries. Based on the results of the surveys, a set of harmonized economic indicators is calculated for all participating countries, typically used for analysis and short-term forecasting of economic developments, as well as economic research. Furthermore, the indicators lend themselves to detecting turning points in the business cycle and are a complement to official statistical data on economic developments, which are released with a significantly longer time-lag.


## The programme in a nutshell

The European Union (EU) co-finances the implementation of business and consumer surveys in its Member States, as well as candidate countries. The recipient institutes commit to conducting monthly surveys among firms in selected economic sectors as well as consumers using a harmonised questionnaire and transmitting the results to the European Commission. The latter provides them to the public free of charge. Within the European Commission, the programme is managed by the *Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs* (DG ECFIN).

## Harmonized questionnaire

The harmonised questionnaire of the *Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys* has been developed jointly with the OECD. Its questions refer to economic developments in recent months and at present, as well as the expected developments in the next months and are generally answered on a three-point (business surveys) / five-point (consumer survey) answering scale.

Here are some examples from the harmonised business surveys:

* *How has your production developed over the past 3 months? It has increased / remained unchanged / decreased*
* *Do you consider your current overall order books to be? More than sufficient (above normal) / sufficient (normal for the season) / not sufficient (below normal)*
* *How do you expect your production to develop over the next 3 months? It will increase / remain unchanged / decrease*

Here are some examples from the harmonised consumer survey:

* *How has the financial situation of your household changed over the last 12 months? It has got a lot better / got a little better / stayed the same / got a little worse / got a lot worse / don't know*
* *How do you expect the general economic situation in this country to develop over the next 12 months? It will get a lot better / get a little better / stay the same / get a little worse / get a lot worse / don't know*
* *In view of the general economic situation, do you think that now it is the right moment for people to make major purchases such as furniture, electrical/electronic devices, etc.? Yes, it is the right moment now / it is neither the right moment nor the wrong moment / no, it is not the right moment now / don't know*

Besides the above types of questions, which inquire qualitative assessments, the harmonised questionnaire also contains a few questions capturing quantitative answers, e.g. the estimated rate of capacity utilisation of the responding firms or the inflation rate consumers expect for the near future. The only harmonised survey which consists to a large extent of quantitative questions is the bi-annual investment survey in the manufacturing survey.

The complete questionnaire of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys can be accessed via the programme's dedicated User Guide. The national questionnaires designed on the basis of the harmonised questionnaire and used in the different EU Member States and candidate countries are available on the programme's website.
