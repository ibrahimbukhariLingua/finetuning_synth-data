# Capital Airlines (Nigeria)



**Capital Airlines Limited** was a charter airline headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, that operated scheduled and chartered domestic flights out of its base at Murtala Muhammed International Airport and Ilorin International Airport.


## History

Capital Airlines was founded in 2003. In mid-2005, the airline partnered with Synergy Group to operate Nigeria's viable fringe airports and to open some alternative airports, hitherto considered unviable.

The Nigerian government set a deadline of April 30, 2007 for all airlines operating in the country to re-capitalise or be grounded, in an effort to ensure better services and safety. Capital Airlines satisfied the demanded criteria in terms of re-capitalization and was re-registered for operation.
