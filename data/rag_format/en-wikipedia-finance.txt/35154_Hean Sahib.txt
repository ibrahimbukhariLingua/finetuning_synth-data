In his early career, **Hean Sahib** was the first Director of the Economics and Finance Institute (EFI) of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), which was established in 1997.

Under his leadership, EFI has attracted technical and financial supports from key development partners, such as EU, World Bank, IMF, UNDP, ADB, JICA, SIDA, and Temasek Foundation International. EFI has also established close cooperation and collaboration with international training and research institutes, including Charles Sturt University of Australia, Korea Development Institute of South Korea, Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, Asia-Pacific Finance and Development Institute of China, and Civil Service College of Singapore.

Besides, **Hean Sahib** has been leading a nationwide project called “Financial Management Information System - FMIS”, which has helped to improve efficiency, accountability, transparency, and good governance over the usage of the national budget.
