At age 99, David Rockefeller was the oldest.

Among the largest gainers from the previous year's list was Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. A rapid rise in the price of Facebook stock saw his net worth soar from $13.3 billion in 2013 to $28.5 billion in 2014. WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum saw his net worth rise from less than a billion to $6.8 billion. He debuted at #202 overall, while partner Brian Acton debuted at #551 with $3 billion.

A total of 1,645 people made the 2014 billionaire list, represented combined wealth of $6.4 trillion. Of those, a record 268 were newcomers, surpassing 2008's 226 newcomers. The list included 42 female newcomers. One hundred people listed in 2013 failed to make the list. The number of women on the list rose to a record 172 in 2014, up from 138 the previous year. However, only 12 of them were completely self-made without the help of parents or spouses.
