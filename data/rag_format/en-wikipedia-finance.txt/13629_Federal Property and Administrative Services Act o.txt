The **Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949** is the United States federal law which established the General Services Administration (GSA). The act also provides for various Federal Standards to be published by the GSA. Among these is Federal Standard 1037C, a comprehensive source of definitions of terms used in telecommunications.
