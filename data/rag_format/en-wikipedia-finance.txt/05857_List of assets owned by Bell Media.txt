Bell Media's predecessors, including CTVglobemedia, previously held most of their television assets through a subsidiary, CTV Inc. (the former Baton Broadcasting Inc.). This entity was amalgamated with CTVglobemedia and other subsidiaries in early 2011, and briefly carried the "CTV Inc." name until being renamed Bell Media Inc. later that year. All of Bell Media's conventional television licences are currently held directly by Bell Media Inc.
