## History

Co-founders Sanjit Biswas and John Bicket met while graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The pair founded Samsara in 2015 after selling their previous company, Meraki, to Cisco Systems in 2012. Samsara was initially created to provide sensor technology for industrial operations, and Andreessen Horowitz became a Series A round early investor.

Samsara achieved unicorn status in March 2018 after a funding round led to a valuation of over $1B. Another funding round later that year rose the valuation to $3.6B backed by Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst. A Series F funding round saw Samsara's valuation rise to $6.3B with Tiger Global Management and Dragoneer Investment Group joining for the first time.

Samsara was impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a reduction to their staff.

In February 2019, Samsara introduced new AI dash cameras that use computer vision to interpret road scenes and driving behavior. In February 2021, the startup announced that it had surpassed $300 million in run-rate subscription revenue, serving over 20,000 customers and adding seven new patents.

In December 2021, Samsara publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “IOT” and the company’s initial public offering raised $805 million.
