# Jenny Campbell



**Jennifer Bernice Campbell** (*née* **Sproson**; born 5 October 1961) is a British entrepreneur. She bought YourCash Europe Ltd from RBS in 2010. She was a "Dragon" in Series 15 and 16 of the UK's *Dragons' Den*, between 2017 – 2019.

In 2010, Campbell bought Hanco ATM systems from the Royal Bank of Scotland and subsequently renamed the business as YourCash. YourCash is an independent automated teller machine (ATM) provider with operations in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. Campbell sold the business in 2016. Before YourCash acquisition, she had worked with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group for 32 years in various roles, including sales, operational, change, risk and management.


## Career

Campbell left school at 16 to join NatWest as a cash-counter and cash point filler. She attended a night school to study banking and then got a job in NatWest's head office in London. Following the RBS takeover of NatWest in 2000, Campbell was given a senior role in the operational integration of the two banks.


### Banking and YourCash

In 2006, Campbell was appointed as Head of Operations at Hanco ATM Systems, a subsidiary of RBS, which would eventually become YourCash. Hanco had significantly expanded in a short period and had an annual profit of £7 million. The economic recession of 2007 caused RBS to sell Hanco. Campbell seized the opportunity and bid for it. The sale was put on hold until 2009, but in mid-2010, Campbell led the first management buyout of Hanco. Shortly afterwards, she renamed the business YourCash. In 2013, Campbell led a successful secondary buyout of the remaining management and acquired 100% of the business through a refinancing agreement. Campbell became YourCash's primary stakeholder. Under Campbell's guidance, YourCash continued to grow its ATM fleets in the Netherlands and the UK and expanded into Belgium and Ireland.


### Charity and social work

Campbell is involved in charities and projects that support entrepreneurs and disadvantaged young people. This includes The Prince's Trust where she is the Vice President of the Enterprise Fellowship program alongside the Co-Vice President, Nick Wheeler of Charles Tyrwhitt Menswear and the Chairperson, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of EasyJet.

In 2015, Campbell was admitted as a Freeman of the Guild of Entrepreneurs, which aims to foster the development of founders and new business owners while providing entrepreneurship opportunities to young individuals. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Dragons' Den (2017-2019)

Campbell joined BBC's reality business program, Dragons' Den in 2017 as a dragon for Series 15 and Series 16. After investing in five companies, she left the show in 2019 to support her sons in their entrepreneurial businesses and to focus on charity work. As a dragon, she invested in ParkingPerx, Didsbury Gin, hemp skincare producer Carun UK, truck advertising firm Driven Media and energy switching service Look After My Bills. Campbell sold her equity in Driven Media, Look After My Bills and Carun in 2019.

Even though Campbell made 12 investments throughout her time on the show, it became a running joke amongst the show's fanbase that she would be "out" relatively quickly. This has even been acknowledged by the official Dragons' Den YouTube channel, which published a compilation video of the companies that Campbell invested in, entitled "6 times Jenny Campbell Forgot to Say "I'm Out"".
