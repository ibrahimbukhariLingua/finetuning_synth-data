Anglo-Saxon Petroleum


# Anglo-Saxon Petroleum



**Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co Ltd** is a private company owned by Royal Dutch Shell.


## History

Around 1898 the company became responsible for the ships of Shell Transport and Trading. In 1907 it continued to be responsible for the trade in oil by-products when the Dutch Petroleum Company was established to take over the petroleum business of the Dutch state authorities and the Shell company. The same year it was incorporated into Royal Dutch Shell. In 1908 Shell Transport and Trading had placed all of its assets in Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co and Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij which also held all of the assets of Royal Dutch Shell. Since then the company owned and ran the oil transport and storage activities of the Shell group of companies. During the following two decades Anglo-Saxon became the most progressive, innovative and forward-looking of all the oil carriers. In order to match transport demand, they commissioned new buildings based on their own design or, indeed, bought and re-designed existing ships with an amazing degree of innovative thinking and fantasy. Liner ships, general cargo vessels, sailing ships and even train ferries were re-built and made into oil carriers.

In November 1955 The Shell Petroleum Company Ltd. took over the assets of Anglo-Saxon, which ceased to function as a separate company.
