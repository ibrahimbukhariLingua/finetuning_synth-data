## Bank Fraud

Despite having reputation and success in the ship building industry, in 2012 the finances of ABG started dwindling which was later discovered by a forensic audit by E&Y initiated by SBI. During the audit it was alleged that the top management of the company was involved in diversion of funds causing criminal breach of trust with an intent to use the banks funds for personal gains possibly to tax havens. SBI stated that funds were used to pay other lenders and get letters of credit.
