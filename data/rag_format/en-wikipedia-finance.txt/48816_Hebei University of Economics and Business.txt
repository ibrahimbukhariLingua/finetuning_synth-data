## History


### Hebei Trade & Finance Institute (since 1953)

Hebei Trade & Finance Institute traces its roots back to the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Society Cooperative School in Shijiazhuang in 1953. In 1958, it was renamed as the "Hebei Province School of Business and Technical Cadres." Following a merger with the Provincial Grain School in 1959, it was transformed into the "Hebei Province School of Finance and Trade Technical Cadres." Building upon this foundation in 1960, the "Hebei Province School of Commerce" was established, but due to historical reasons, it ceased operations after 1965. The institution was re-established as the "Hebei Province School of Commerce" in 1973. Expanding on this, the Hebei College of Finance and Trade was founded in 1978 on the basis of the Hebei Province School of Commerce, and it was renamed the Hebei Trade & Finance Institute in 1984.


### Hebei College of Trade & Economics (since 1968)

The history of Hebei College of Trade & Economics dates back to the establishment of the Hebei Provincial Hutuo River Five-Seven Cadre School in September 1968.

Then, in 1994, Hebei College of Trade & Economics was founded based on the foundation of Hebei Institute of Economic Management Cadres.


### Hebei Commerce College (since 1956)

The origins of Hebei Commerce College can be traced back to the establishment of the "Hebei Provincial Business Cadre School" in 1956. Following a restructure in 1959, it became the "Hebei Provincial School of Finance and Trade Cadres." It was renamed once again as the "Hebei Provincial Business Cadre School" in 1963. Due to specific circumstances, enrollment was temporarily suspended in 1965. In 1982, the Hebei Provincial Business Cadre School was reestablished and operated at the same location as the Hebei Provincial School of Commerce. This institution underwent changes and was renamed the "Hebei Business Vocational College" in 1984. Its name was changed once more in 1992 to become the "Hebei Commerce College".


### Merger and the Establishment of Hebei University of Economics and Business

Hebei University of Economics and Business (HUEB) was established in 1995 under approval by the State Education Commission and through combination of three former colleges(Hebei Trade & Finance Institute, Hebei College of Trade & Economics and Hebei Commerce College).

### Fight for Doctoral Degree Conferring Right

Universities in China have to pass strict examination system to obtain doctoral degree conferring right. HUEB currently has no right to confer doctoral degrees, unlike neighboring universities such as Shandong University of Finance and Economics, Shanxi University of Finance and Economics, and Tianjin University of Finance and Economics. HUEB's subject offerings are limited to finance and economics, with no science or technology disciplines, making its overall academic strength relatively weak compared to other institutions in Hebei province. Other universities of similar academic quality, such as North China University of Science and Technology and Hebei University of Science and Technology, already have or are in the process of obtaining the right to confer doctoral degrees. With even lower admission requirements and academic quality, the Hebei University of Engineering in Handan has also received a special project doctoral program.
