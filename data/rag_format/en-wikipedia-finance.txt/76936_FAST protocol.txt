FAST protocol


# FAST protocol



The **FAST protocol** (FIX Adapted for STreaming) is a technology standard developed by FIX Protocol Ltd., specifically aimed at optimizing data representation on the network. It is used to support high-throughput, low latency data communications between financial institutions.

In particular, it is a technology standard that offers significant compression capabilities for the transport of high-volume market data feeds and ultra low latency applications.


## History


### Timeline

* 2004 Market Data optimization Working Group (“mdowg”) was formed
* 2005 Proof of Concept (“POC”) project
* 2006 FAST 1.0 released
* 2007 FAST 1.1 released
* 2009 FAST 1.2 proposed

In November 2004, Mike Cormack (then CEO Archipelago Holding) spoke at the FPL (FIX Protocol Ltd) conference in New York regarding a call for action to meet the challenges of the increased market data volumes. The increasing volumes of market data were causing delays, preventing market data from reaching traders in a timely fashion, thus disrupting their ability to trade. The classic FIX tag value format was considered to be too verbose and had a high processing overhead. A working group was formed within FPL shortly after the conference.


## Current version of FAST

The approved standard is currently at version 5.0, and is used in commercially available products. There are Open Source implementations of the Protocol available.
