New York Angels


# New York Angels



**New York Angels** is an organization of seed capital angel investors that provides equity capital for early stage companies, primarily in the field of technology and new media. It is based in New York City. Members typically invest between US$100,000 and US$1,500,000 in companies that have begun operations, but have not reached a stage for acquiring venture capital.

In 1997, NYNMA co-founders, including Brian Horey, Laura Sachar, Alain Bankier and Jason Wright, facilitated the creation of the program to match new entrepreneurs with experienced Angel Investors. Following the crash of the dot-com bubble, NYNMA was disbanded and, in 2003, some of its remaining active angel investors spun themselves off into a separate, not-for-profit group under the leadership of David S. Rose, a serial entrepreneur and investor.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
