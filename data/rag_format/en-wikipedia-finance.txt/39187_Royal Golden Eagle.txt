Owned by Indonesian businessman Sukanto Tanoto, the group employs 80,000 people worldwide with assets exceeding US$35 billion.


## History

Sukanto Tanoto founded his first business in 1967, supplying spare parts to the oil and construction industries in Indonesia, before winning contracts in building gas pipelines for multinationals in 1972. His business grew considerably following the 1973 oil crisis when he open his own plywood mill in Indonesia. He diversified into palm oil in 1979. Since 1985, Tanoto’s companies have planted 30,000 acres of palm oil plantation each year, with plantations spread over three provinces in Sumatra with a total land area of 160,000 hectares. He listed the public pulp and paper business Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings (APRIL) on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995, delisting it in 2001.

## Environmental issues

In 2014, Royal Golden Eagle was under considerable pressure from international environmental organisations to improve:

* World Business Council for Sustainable Development told APRIL that it would be expelled from the organisation if it did not end deforestation within 12 months, noting a government estimate that 60% of its pulp came from the rainforest. It also recommended that all Royal Golden Eagle companies should be included in the commitment, not just APRIL.
* The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) gave a cautious response to APRIL's announced Sustainable Forest Management Policy, noting that the policies did not go far enough and that previous commitments had not been honoured. It recommends that external parties should 'wait and see' before sourcing or investing in APRIL or associated businesses.
* Greenpeace claimed that APRIL, along with its sister companies, "is the greatest threat to the Indonesian rainforest".

In June 2015, both Greenpeace and WWF welcomed the commitments made by RGE and APRIL to zero deforestation across their supply chains.

In December 2015, APRIL announced a US$100 million investment in conservation and eco-restoration of peatland in Riau, spanning 150,000 hectares.

The company and its business groups engage local communities and NGOs to develop programs for community development and fire prevention, to great success.

In 2011 the Rainforest Action Network named APRIL as one of Indonesia’s most destructive corporations cutting rainforests and replacing them with monoculture acacia pulp wood plantations grown on these cleared rainforests and peatlands. APRIL and another major company under separate ownership, Asia Pulp & Paper, produce 80 percent of Indonesia’s pulp and paper.


## Controversy


### Tax evasion

Asian Agri was investigated for allegedly evading taxes between 2002 and 2005, which the company consistently denied. In December 2012, the Supreme Court of Indonesia ordered Asian Agri Group to pay Rp2.52 trillion (US$260 million) in back taxes and fines as vicarious liability, The company paid the back tax and in January 2014 paid the fine saying it would still file a judicial review. Indonesia’s Tempo magazine was found guilty by the Jakarta court of defaming the company in an investigative report looking into these matters, which were published in the book Key Witness.


### Deutsche Bank controversy

Beckett Pte Ltd, 29% of which is indirectly owned by Sukanto Tanoto, was in legal disputes against Deutsche Bank, claiming that the bank had pledged shares, owned directly or indirectly by Beckett Pte Ltd in PT Swabara Mining and Energy, PT Asminco Bara Utama, PT Indonesia Bulk Terminal and PT Adaro Indonesia without due process and at an undervalue. Singapore's High Court found in favour of Deutsche Bank. The High Court did however state that Deutsche Bank had "failed to discharge its duties as pledgee" in a share sale.
