Foodbank of Indonesia


# Foodbank of Indonesia



**The Food Bank of Indonesia** is a non-profit foundation operating in the social sector. Located in Jakarta, the Food Bank of Indonesia is the first food bank in the country actively working to provide access to food and eradicate hunger in various regions across Indonesia. FOI also supports the country in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by promoting food sovereignty and implementing responsible patterns of production and consumption.

FOI has the slogan *"Take what you need, give what you can."*

The Food Bank of Indonesia (FOI) operates through two distinct branches, each serving a specific facet of our mission. Firstly, we endeavor to address the issue of surplus food by directing these resources towards providing sustenance for individuals across various socioeconomic strata who find themselves in need. This initiative aligns with our commitment to mitigating hunger and ensuring that surplus food is utilized for the betterment of communities.

Secondly, in instances where surplus food is not suitable for direct consumption, FOI engages in strategic food production in regions with established agricultural expertise. This involves transforming inedible items into valuable agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizers. By doing so, we contribute to the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices and bolster the overall resilience of the agricultural sector.


## History

**The Foodbank of Indonesia**, established on May 20, 2015, in Jakarta, holds the distinction of being the first food bank in Indonesia. Founded by Wida Septiyani and Hendro Utomo, dedicated individuals who have become the driving force behind the organization, Foodbank of Indonesia (FOI) operates as a non-profit entity serving as a repository for surplus food, channeling it to communities in need. The establishment of FOI in May 2015 marked a concrete step in their commitment to supporting The Global Foodbank Network, a global non-profit organization dedicated to distributing food to those in need.

FOI plays a crucial role in collecting surplus food for distribution to beneficiaries, especially vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those facing economic challenges. Currently, FOI's coverage extends to 39 locations in Java and beyond. The organization has a network comprising 4,454 volunteers and donors from various companies, stores, food producers, and retail traders. Together, FOI, along with its donors and volunteers, has distributed 1,246 tons or 88,095 food packages to FOI clients, including children, victims of natural disasters, the elderly, informal workers, and others.


## The issue of food waste in Indonesia

Food loss and waste (FLW) have emerged as key targets for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. According to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, a significant portion, 44%, of Indonesia's landfills is attributed to food waste. A report from the EIU highlights Indonesia as one of the world's major contributors to food waste, with an alarming figure of 300 kg/capita/year.

**BAPPENAS** estimates the FLW in Indonesia, spanning from 2000 to 2019, to be in the range of 115–184 kg/capita/year. This study emphasizes the need for a national policy addressing FLW reduction and the provision of comprehensive national FLW data. The integration of technology throughout the food supply chain, from harvest to retail distribution, is proposed as a solution to minimize food loss. Successful strategies to combat food waste require widespread socialization, educational initiatives, and a concerted public movement. Early cultural education discouraging food wastage is deemed crucial. The implementation of regulations and strategies to reduce FLW holds the potential to significantly boost food availability, promoting sustainable food security and nutrition in Indonesia.


### How about the food system in Indonesia?

The food system in Indonesia encompasses various aspects and, like most countries, can be divided into two main categories: the conventional food system and alternative food systems. Here is a general overview of the food system in Indonesia:

1. Conventional Food System:
 * Mass Production: The majority of consumed food comes from mass production, including staple crops like rice, corn, and soybeans, as well as livestock such as chickens, cows, and fish.
 * Distribution and Supply Chain: These products are distributed through a supply chain involving farmers, traders, distributors, and retailers. A significant portion of food products is sold through traditional markets, supermarkets, and small shops.
2. Alternative Food Systems:
 * Local Farming: There is a growing trend of local and small-scale farming in Indonesia, including organic and sustainable agriculture. Communities engaged in local farming may sell their products directly to consumers or through local markets.
 * Cooperative Initiatives: Some community groups or farmers form cooperatives or producer groups to enhance their access to markets and increase bargaining power for fair pricing.
3. Issues and Challenges:
 * Inequality of Access: Despite the diversity of food resources in Indonesia, there are challenges in distributing food evenly, especially in rural areas.
 * Vulnerability to Climate Change: Indonesian agriculture can be affected by climate change, impacting productivity and food availability.
 * Infrastructure Development: Infrastructure such as roads, storage, and distribution facilities needs continuous improvement to enhance efficiency and food availability.
4. Government Programs:
 * The Indonesian government has programs to support agriculture and food security, including incentives for farmers, food assistance programs, and campaigns to raise public awareness about healthy eating patterns.

## Food waste issue

The most recent global data reveals that 8% of all produced food worldwide is lost at the farm level, 14% between the farm gate and the retail sector, and 17% at the consumer level (including households, retailers, restaurants, and other food services) (FAO 2019; UNEP 2021). The economic repercussions of FLW are primarily tied to the value of lost food, which could be preserved with effective waste prevention. Numerous studies indicate that programs combating food waste often yield a high economic return, offering substantial benefits with minimal investment, especially when focusing on prevention (Hanson and Mitchell 2017). The environmental impact of FLW stems from the use of raw materials and natural resources for producing unconsumed food, contributing to 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from agricultural processes and livestock rearing. With current FLW rates, it means that as much as 6% of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to producing food that is lost within the supply chain or during consumption (Poore and Nemecek 2018). Inefficiencies in FLW also affect food security, jeopardizing the ability of food supply chains to adequately feed the growing population, which is projected to reach nine billion. From an ethical standpoint, the wastage of billions of tonnes of food is lamentable, especially when one in ten people globally is undernourished (FAO 2019).

Initial studies on FLW provided an overview of the problem's magnitude (Parftt et al. 2010; Gustavsson et al. 2011) and played a crucial role in raising awareness about the issue. The number of studies reporting FLW amounts at different stages of the food chain significantly increased after 2010, offering evidence of FLW generation in various settings. However, the approach remained fragmented for several years, with studies often focusing on case studies that were challenging to scale up or generalize. In recent years, following the global agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030, there has been increasing pressure to standardize FLW measurement methods across countries and stages of the food supply chain. The aim is to provide reliable input data for monitoring progress towards the targets set for FLW reduction.


## Activity

Foodbank of Indonesia conducts various activities, including:

1. **Mentari Bangsaku (MB)** Mentari Bangsaku is a school food program for young children from modest families. Primarily conducted through Early Childhood Education (PAUD), this program ensures that children can grow and learn effectively during their formative years, becoming the nation's future "suns." The program is typically implemented to instill the habit of having breakfast among children. An achievement indicator for the Mentari Bangsaku program is the Independent Food Program. The Independent Food Program is an extension of the Mentari Bangsaku initiative, wherein schools become capable of providing food access to their students independently, without assistance from the Foodbank of Indonesia. This program collaborates with PAUD and Elementary Schools (SD) in 22 cities and regencies across Indonesia.
2. **Sayap dari Ibu (SADARI)** Sayap dari Ibu is a program designed to assist mothers in ensuring access to nutritious food for their children, enabling them to soar and achieve their dreams. This program involves food intervention for children aged 0–5 years, pregnant and lactating mothers. Additionally, it provides education and guidance for children, parents, caregivers, local government leaders, and community health workers, aiming to enhance knowledge and skills that can influence behavior. The ultimate goal is to empower mothers and caregivers to provide a healthy and nourishing environment for their children.
3. **Response in Emergency Disaster (RED)** RED is a disaster response program aimed at providing post-disaster assistance, including food items and other logistical needs, to disaster victims, with a particular focus on children, women, and the elderly. The program aims to offer hope and encouragement to disaster victims, helping them to recover and rebuild swiftly.
4. **Kebun Pangan Komunitas (KEPAK)** KEPAK aims to enhance community-based family food resilience. In this program, family communities are encouraged to independently produce local food, including plants and livestock. This approach ensures that food access, especially for vulnerable groups such as children within families, is effectively met. The program emphasizes self-sufficiency and sustainability by empowering families to cultivate and raise their own food resources.
5. **Qurban Hingga Pelosok** is an annual program by the Foodbank of Indonesia aimed at distributing Qurban to remote regions, particularly during the celebration of Eid al-Adha. Through Qurban to Remote Areas, FOI strives to encourage communities to improve the nutrition of children in secluded villages by ensuring the provision of animal protein. The program also aims to share the joy and pleasure of Qurban meat with families in these remote areas who may rarely, if ever, have the opportunity to enjoy it.
6. **Dapur Pangan FOI (DPF)** is a community-driven food processing program aimed at distributing food to the elderly and children in need. Community-based, DPF is led by volunteer groups actively combating hunger through the preparation and distribution of nutritious food. Established to assist communities in acquiring dignified and nutritious food, DPF operates in accordance with the law, recognizing access to quality food as a fundamental human right. It fosters a spirit of mutual cooperation within communities through food-based activities. Currently, DPF operates in 115 locations in the Jabotabek region.
