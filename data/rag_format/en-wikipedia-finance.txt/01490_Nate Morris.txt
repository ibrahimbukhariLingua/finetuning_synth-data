He was close to his grandfather, Lewis Sexton, who was a former president of the Ford plant United Auto Workers union in Louisville. While attending Eastern High School, Morris reportedly developed political aspirations after multiple spinal fractures derailed his hopes of a football career in the fall of 1996.

Beginning in 1999, Morris attended George Washington University on an academic scholarship from the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry in Washington, D.C., where he studied international affairs, was member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, and elected Phi Beta Kappa. Morris attended graduate school at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Morris also graduated from the University of Oxford’s Said Business School, where he was a member of St Hugh's College; he is also a member of the Oxford Union.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Early career and politics

Morris is a Republican and is noted as a political fundraiser. Morris raised over $50,000 for President George W. Bush's 2004 reelection campaign. He has worked in a variety of roles for several Kentucky Republicans, including the U.S House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Department of Labor.

Morris is a friend and supporter of U.S. Senator Rand Paul. He traveled with Paul to Israel in 2013 and raised money for his Senate and presidential campaigns, becoming one of his top fund-raisers. Paul wrote about Morris in his book, *Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America*. Morris was among the biggest donors in Kentucky to Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.

Morris has expressed interest in possibly running for U.S. Senate or governor in Kentucky.


## Business

Morris founded Rubicon Technologies, formerly known as Rubicon Global, in 2008 after collaborating with a high school friend, Marc Spiegel. The company is focused on business-to-business and municipal waste and recycling services. Rubicon became a public company in August 2022, listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RBT. A 2017 *Bloomberg* article described the company's struggles with its technology and business model, as it attempted to distinguish itself from a traditional waste broker.

Mr. Morris stepped down as Rubicon's CEO on October 13, 2022. CTO Phil Rodoni succeeded Morris as CEO. As part of the transition, Morris retained a consulting role, was chairman, and a member of the board of directors.

Morris founded Morris Industries in 2010, where he serves as chairman and CEO, headquartered in Lexington. Morris Industries acquired Republic Financial, an insurance company, in 2024.ᵇᵉᵗᵗᵉʳˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
