# Titan Pharmaceuticals



**Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.** is a biopharmaceutical company based in San Francisco, CA, developing proprietary therapeutics primarily for treating central nervous system ("CNS") disorders. In September 2018, Titan Pharmaceuticals underwent an IPO wherein it raised $9.5 million in gross proceeds. In the same month, it also posted approximately $1.7 million in revenue, in large part drawn from its licensing for its European intellectual property rights for Probuphine to the Italian pharmaceutical company Molteni - a leading European opioid manufacturer and also a subsidiary of the German Pharmaceutical juggernaut Merck Group.

Titan's principal asset is Probuphine, a slow-release implant formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid addiction or chronic pain. FDA Approval was granted on 26 May 2016. It was licensed to Braeburn Pharmaceuticals for marketing and commercialization.
