His mother was born in Belgium to a Polish Jewish family who was hidden from the Nazis by a Catholic institution for six years; her entire family perished in the Holocaust.

Pasternak received his high school diploma in 1972 from Margaretville Central School and received a B.S. degree in education from The State University of New York at New Paltz in 1977. He moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey where he renovated a home and then moved to Jersey City, New Jersey which at the time was hotbed of stock trading, an industry that he sought to enter.

As described in Edgar Perez’s book, *Knightmare on Wall Street: The Rise and Fall of Knight Capital and the Biggest Risk for Financial Markets*, Pasternak claimed he didn’t expect to be CEO of a big company. “I was already looking for an opportunity to retire. I always saw myself as a business builder. I had some health issues. I had diabetes and weighed 325 pounds.”


### Chestnut Ridge Capital

After retiring from Knight Trading Group, seeing a credit bubble, Pasternak founded Chestnut Ridge Capital, LLC, a northern New Jersey–based hedge fund, which also serves as the investing arm of the Pasternak family office.


### The KABR Group

In 2008, seeing that there was opportunity to purchase distressed real estate at a discount, Pasternak founded the real estate investment firm KABR Real Estate Investment Partners LLC. The firm was started with partner Adam Altman where Pasternak serves as CEO and Chairman. KABR Group is dedicated to the purchase of select real-estate assets in the Metro NYC and Greater Jacksonville areas. KABR I was the first marketed product to come out of Chestnut Ridge Capital LLC, and was succeeded by later funds - KABR II through KABR VI. Ken Pasternak owns a significant portion of both the General Partner ("GP") and Limited Partner ("LP") portions of each of the KABR Funds. The combined Fair Market Value (FMV) of KABR Funds II – VI and other GP managed assets is approximately over $1 billion as of April 2024.

On June 1, 2009, KABR closed a deal to purchase 85 Challenger Road – a 235,000 sq ft (21,800 m²) office building in Ridgefield Park, NJ. The Class-A office building sits adjacent to the NJ Turnpike and was formerly occupied by the Daewoo Corporation. KABR purchased the building from AIG for "...the right price" according to Pasternak – though the purchase price was undisclosed at the time – it was later reported to be approximately $10.5mm.

On October 25, 2020, KABR sold the 85 Challenger Road office building in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, for a reported $60mm. The Class-A office building was fully leased to Samsung Electronics America – whose tenancy KABR renewed in 2019.

In April of 2024, KABR completed the raise for its KABR VI fund at over $100,000,000 from accredited investors.

The NASD fined Pasternak $100,000 for each supervisory violation. However, a federal court ruled that Pasternak was not liable for any violation. On March 5, 2010, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) council reversed a ruling that found two former Knight Securities LP senior executives were responsible for supervisory failures in connection with allegedly fraudulent sales to institutional customers.
