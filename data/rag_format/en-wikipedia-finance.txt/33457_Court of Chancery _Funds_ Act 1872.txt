## Passage

The Court of Chancery (Funds) Bill was first introduced in the 1871 session of parliament, but was withdrawn on 27 July 1871.

Leave to bring in the re-introduced Court of Chancery (Funds) Bill was granted to William Edward Baxter MP, the Solicitor General, Sir George Jessel MP, and William Henry Gladstone MP on 14 February 1872. The bill had its first reading in the House of Commons on 14 February 1872, presented by William Edward Baxter MP. The bill had its second reading in the House of Commons on 4 April 1872, where a motion to postpone the bill for 6-months was rejected. The bill was described as "pretty nearly" the same as the 1871 Bill. During debate, the bill was criticised by members including Mr. Crawford and William Henry Gregory MP, who argued that the current system was working well (with only Â£1,000 lost to fraud in 150 years) and expressed concerns about mixing judicial and political functions and the government's ulterior motive to use the funds for Terminable Annuities to reduce national debt. On 29 April 1872, a motion to commit the bill to a select committee was withdrawn. The bill was committed to a committee of the whole house, which met on 13 May 1872, where a motion by Sir Richard Baggallay MP to refer the bill to a was defeated.

The amended bill had its third reading in the House of Commons on 18 June 1872 and passed, with amendments.

The bill had its first reading in the House of Lords on 18 June 1872.
