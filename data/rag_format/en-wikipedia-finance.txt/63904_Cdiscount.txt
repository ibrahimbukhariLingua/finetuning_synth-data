## History

Founded in December 1998 by three brothers, Hervé, Christophe and Nicolas Charle, Cdiscount has been a subsidiary of Casino Group since February 2000. In September 2008 Casino Group increased both its direct and indirect participation to 79,6% of the capital and adopted a new structure with a board constituted of Casino founders and representatives.

In January 2011, Casino Group bought the Charle brothers' shares and now possess 99.6% of the capital.

In October 2014, Cdiscount continues its internationalization with the opening of cdiscount.com.br in Brazil, with the support of Cnova Brasil.

In 2023, Cdiscount's parent Casino announced that they have completed a deal to avoid bankruptcy. This restructuring procedure would allow for the company to cut high debt and improve recent losses to other rival supermarket corporations. In 2024, Casino USA filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy.


## Operations

Cdiscount.com is an online retailer for goods and services. Its range is structured around 40 stores organized in categories: cultural goods, high-tech, IT, household appliances, and personal appliances (games, toys…). In order to grow further Cdiscount has incorporated high-potential goods and services under their banner (financing, insurance, travel, wine, mobile phone subscription…).

In 2006 Cdiscount opened a pilot physical store in Le Bouscat near Bordeaux (France) that utilises sales data from the websites to select only the best-selling products. This store also acted as a delivery point for small packages.

A second store opened up in 2011 in Paris's 7th district, Rue du Bac. This store displays the bestsellers from the website in every category, totalling over 2000 products across high-tech, IT, appliances, toys, DVDs, video games, and wines and spirits.

The company being based in Bordeaux (region of Gironde), products are stocked in the area in the logistics site of Cestas Pot au Pin.
