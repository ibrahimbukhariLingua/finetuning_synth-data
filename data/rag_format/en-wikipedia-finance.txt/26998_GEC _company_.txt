## History

GEC was founded in 1994 as Capital Alliance Group Inc, changed its name to CIBT Education Group Inc, and Global Education Communities Corp (GEC) in 2023.

In 1995, GEC partnered with City University of Seattle to deliver City University's MBA programs in China.

In 2005, the joint program between GEC and City University Seattle was recognized by the *World Manager Weekly* as one of the influential Sino-Foreign Joint MBA Program in China.

In 2008, GEC acquired a 75 percent stake in Target, a provider of practical nursing and health-related training.

In 2010, GEC acquired the Vancouver-based KGIC Education Group, with seven campuses in Canada and facilities in Brazil, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan.

In 2013, GEC sold KGIC Education Group to a Toronto-based public company for $13.5 million.

In 2014, GEC established the GEC Pearson campus-housing complex in the southwest region of Vancouver. In the same year, GEC initiated the Global Education Centre project in Richmond. The development includes a 313-room hotel for international students and a nine-storey building with classrooms for private educators.

In 2015, GEC acquired Viva Hotel in downtown Vancouver to convert into student housing.

In 2016, GEC announced a plan to develop a 50-storey, $200-million educational facility on the site of the former Stardust roller rink in the city centre of Surrey. The project was named the GEC Education Mega Centre.

In 2017, GEC acquired KGIC Education Group from the Toronto-based public company for $3.5 million and renamed it as Sprott Shaw Language College.

In January 2019, GEC purchased three land parcels at Oakridge to develop GEC Oakridge, a rental apartment near the Oakridge Shopping Centre in Vancouver.

In June 2020, GEC acquired two apartment buildings, providing up to 254 additional student beds.
