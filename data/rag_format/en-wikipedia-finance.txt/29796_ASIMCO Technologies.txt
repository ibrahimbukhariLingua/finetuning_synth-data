## Founding

ASIMCO Technologies was founded in 1994 by Jack Perkowski with a business model based on accessing and transferring capital, technology and managerial techniques from the United States and Europe to upgrade existing Chinese manufacturing operations that fall under the ASIMCO umbrella. The company's first ventures into China saw them lose some US$400 million before they managed to establish themselves in the late 1990s/early 2000s.
