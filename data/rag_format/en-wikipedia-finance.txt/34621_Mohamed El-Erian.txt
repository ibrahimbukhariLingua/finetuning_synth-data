## Early life and education

El-Erian was born in New York City on August 19, 1958, to Egyptian parents Abdullah El-Erian, then an ambassador (later, a judge at the International Court of Justice), and Nadia Shoukry, a cousin of Egyptian politician Ibrahim Shoukry. Shortly after El-Erian's birth, the family moved back to Egypt, where he spent some of his early childhood along with short periods in Europe while his father attended meetings of the International Law Commission. In 1968, the family moved back to New York when his father took a position at the United Nations. From 1971–73, they lived in France while El-Erian's father was the Egyptian ambassador to that nation.

After attending St John's School, Leatherhead, a boarding school in England, he gained a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge, and received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1980. He later obtained a master's degree (1983) and a doctorate (1985) in economics from St Antony's College, Oxford. In June 2011, El-Erian received an honorary doctorate degree from the American University in Cairo. In December 2013, he became an honorary fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge.

El-Erian has served on the boards of trustees of several educational institutions, including Pegasus, St. Margaret School, Cambridge in America and KAUST. He co-chairs the capital campaign for Cambridge University.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Career

After his studies at Oxbridge, El-Erian settled in the US in 1983, taking a position at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., where he rose to become deputy director. He moved to the private sector in January 1998, working in London at Salomon Smith Barney/Citigroup before being recruited by PIMCO to lead its work on emerging markets.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

El-Erian worked for several years at PIMCO as a managing director and head of the emerging market portfolio team, where he earned notoriety by avoiding the 2001 bond default by Argentina that otherwise stung the international bond market. Subsequently, he was appointed CEO and president of Harvard Management Company, the entity that manages Harvard's endowment and related accounts. He also served as a member of the faculty of Harvard Business School. As of 2020, he is a member of the Harvard Global Advisory Council. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

After twenty months at Harvard, El-Erian returned to PIMCO in December 2007 as CEO and co-CIO. As CEO of PIMCO, El-Erian was responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and leading its operations globally. As co-CIO with PIMCO co-founder Bill H. Gross, El-Erian oversaw investment policies and strategies for all the company's portfolio management activities. He helped deliver investment performance for clients and grow PIMCO's assets under management from under $1 trillion to $2 trillion.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On December 21, 2012, President Obama announced the appointment of El-Erian as the chair of the president's Global Development Council, leading the council in its role of informing and providing advice to the president and other senior U.S. officials on global development policies and practices.

On January 21, 2014, El-Erian resigned from PIMCO effective March of that year, stating he decided to leave after receiving a letter from his daughter outlining important events in her life that he missed. However, it was widely reported that his resignation was triggered by conflicts with Gross, raising questions about the company's succession plan as El-Erian was widely perceived as heir apparent to the 69-year-old Gross. Despite this, El-Erian praised Gross as "a brilliant investor ... anchored by three things that you hardly ever find in an investor: Strong fundamentals including economics, a really good feel for the market and strong bond math" when Gross departed Pimco.

El-Erian remains a member of the parent company's (Allianz) international executive committee, chairs its International Advisory Committee, and is an advisor to the management board.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
