In April 2017, the company raised $250 million in a new stock offering in anticipation of approval for its first cancer drug, enasidenib, by the US Food and Drug Administration.

In December 2017, the company filed a New Drug Application with the US FDA for ivosidenib for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with an IDH1 mutation.

In November 2019, Agios announced an underwritten public offering of 8,250,000 shares of common stock at a price of $31.00 per share which would result in approximately $256 million aggregate gross proceeds.
