He argued that "those that benefit the most from the ticket resale are the devoted fans". In a 2010 interview with *Billboard*, Tsakalakis said that "StubHub helped rebrand an often-vilified vocation by pushing ticket reselling out of the shadows and providing "a very clean and well-lit place for people to buy tickets, with consumer guarantees that we stand behind." Tsakalakis left StubHub in November 2014, and was replaced by Scott Cutler.
