## History

In 2018, two of the most seasoned electric vehicle service equipment pros in the business started InCharge Energy, both industry veterans, Cameron Funk and Terry O'Day could see the rapid shift to battery powered, electric vehicles happening globally within consumer sectors (before autonomous driving was a thing), easily deducing that electrification made even more economic sense commercially. The two trailblazers put together a band of the brightest stars with one vision in mind; to foster community and environmental health, improve quality life for all, and provide opportunity using their new technology platform. Electric cars require charging infrastructure InCharge was subsequently born with their development and engineering experience (plus some industry knowledge from both having key environmental positions in government) leading the way.

In 2022, ABB acquired InCharge Energy with a controlling stake which strengthen the former's EV charging solutions in the United States.

On April 23, 2022, the company has launched **Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS)** for commercial fleets that supports the EV charging infrastructure. It offers subscription on a monthly or variable basis without directly owning and operating the infrastructure.
