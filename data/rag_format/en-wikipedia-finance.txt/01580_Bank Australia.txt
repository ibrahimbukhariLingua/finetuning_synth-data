Bank Australia


# Bank Australia



**Bank Australia** is an Australian customer-owned bank based in Collingwood, Victoria. The organisation can trace its origins back to 1957, when the **CSIRO Co-operative Credit Society** was formed. Over succeeding years, mergers among 72 other credit unions and co-operative banks eventually led to the creation of the **Members & Education Credit Union (mecu)** in 2003, which became **Bankmecu** in 2011, and Bank Australia in 2015.

Bank Australia is a member organisation of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values and is a certified B Corporation. As of 2023 it had 186,863 customer-members.


## History

The bank has its origins in the 19 September 1957 incorporation of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) Co-operative Credit Society. Walter Ives was appointed as chairman, and the first 40 members, limited to officers and employees of CSIRO aged over 18, were admitted on 15 October.

At the end of 1966 the credit union had over 1770 members, and in that year Joel Belkin was appointed the first full-time general manager (which he held until 1981). In 1982 the society joined the Victorian Credit Co-operatives Association, the peak body for over 140 Victoria-based credit unions. In January 1986, the Canberra-based Laboratories Co-operative Credit Union Limited amalgamated with the CSIRO Co-operative Credit Society, and later that year rebranded as Sirocredit.

On 1 July 1998, Sirocredit merged with Enterprise Credit Union and Outlook Credit Union Co-operative to form Members Australia Credit Union Ltd and, in 2003, Members Australia Credit Union merged with the Education Credit Union (Ed Credit) to form the Members and Education Credit Union, styled as mecu.

In 2011, mecu began trading as Bankmecu, Australia's first customer-owned bank and, in 2015, it commenced trading as Bank Australia.

In 2019 Bank Australia switched to purchasing 100% renewable energy from its suppliers. It was the first bank in Australia to do so.

In June 2020, Bank Australia became a certified B Corp, that is, a for-profit corporation certified by B Lab for its social impact.

In April 2022, Bank Australia responded to shareholder demands and announced their Climate Action Strategy, setting a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2035. This included plans for reductions of their scope 3 emissions, and working with customers to help them reduce their emissions from electricity and gas use.

As of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Bank Australia was an amalgamation of 72 former credit unions and co-operatives. In that same year, it announced plans to merge with Qudos Bank, claiming the new entity would be one of the largest customer-owned banks in the country, with 300,000 customers, total assets approaching $20 billion, and almost 900 employees.

In November 2024, Australian Unity announced agreement to transfer its banking business to Bank Australia. The health, wealth and care group Australian Unity announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Australian Unity Bank Limited, has signed an agreement to transfer its banking business to Bank Australia in late 2025.
Under the agreement, Australian Unity will transition its banking operations to one of Australia’s leading customer-owned banks.
The transfer will include all banking customers and their loans, credit cards and deposit accounts, which at 30 June 2024 sat at 25,000 customers, $1.4b in loans and credit, and $1.6b in deposits.

### Bank Australia Conservation Reserve

The Bank Australia Conservation Reserve is a 2,117-hectare (5,230-acre) private land reserve owned by the bank and its customers. The reserve, made up of four properties, is located in Victoria's Wimmera region and is protected from development forever through a conservation covenant. The company purchased the first of the properties in 2008 in response to customer concerns about the environment. Greening Australia manages the reserve alongside the non-profit Trust for Nature.

## Domain name dispute

Bank Australia launched a domain name dispute on 21 January 2016 for the domain names bankaus.com.au and bankaustralia.com.au. In a single-member judgement on behalf of the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, the claim was denied. Since the domain names in question were registered in 2011 and 2008 respectively, and the name "Bank Australia" was registered only in 2014, there was no evidence that the owner of the domain names had registered them to "prevent the owner of a name, trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name" (cybersquatting) or "primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business or activities of another person".
