American International Corporation


# American International Corporation



**American International Corporation** was an American investment trust founded in 1915 by Frank Vanderlip; Willard Straight was the key operational leader. Its board and stockholders included a wide range of leading American financiers and industrialists.


## History

With an initial capitalization of 50 million dollars and located at 120 Broadway in Manhattan, its goals were to invest in foreign companies and projects, especially in China & Russia during France and the United Kingdom's fiscal distress caused by World War I.

Its ambitious plans were stymied by opposition from the Wilson administration and the focus of attention on supporting the war effort. Russia fell into civil war and China was chaotic after the death of its leader in 1916. Willard Straight died and Vanderlip was fired. Despite years of planning, construction work was never begun on the Corporation's elaborate projects in Russia and China. The Corporation did set up a network of branch offices for National City. Its international investments were not profitable and it switched to domestic investment.
