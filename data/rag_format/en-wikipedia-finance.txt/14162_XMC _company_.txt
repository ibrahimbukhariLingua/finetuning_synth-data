## Background

Wuhan Xinxin was originally founded by the Wuhan Government in 2006 as one of the first semiconductor foundries in Wuhan.

In October 2010, the Donghu New Technology Development Zone Administrative Committee and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) jointly invested in Wuhan Xinxin. SMIC also struck a deal with the Wuhan Government to manage Wuhan Xinxin for a management. Industry critics sated SMIC managed it "half-heartedly".

In March 2013, Wuhan Xinxin acquired SMIC's shares to become an independent company and rebranded itself as XMC shifting focus from foundry services for mainstream products to producing flash memory via an expanded partnership deal with Spansion.

In July 2016, Tsinghua Unigroup acquired a majority stake in XMC with the deal being brokered by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund.Tsinghua Unigroup would merge XMC with its memory chip-making operations to form YTMC with XMC being a subsidiary under it.

In April 2018, Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited the facilities of XMC as part of an inspection tour.

On 3 December 2018, XMC announced the successful development of its three-dimensional wafer stacking technology based on its three-dimensional integration technology platform.

In March 2024, it was reported that XMC initiated a project focused on developing and manufacturing High Bandwidth Memory (HBM).

In May 2024, XMC filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market. On 30 September, the China Securities Regulatory Commission approved XMC's IPO application.

In December 2024, XMC was targeted in a new round of US export controls and added to the United States Department of Commerce's Entity List.
