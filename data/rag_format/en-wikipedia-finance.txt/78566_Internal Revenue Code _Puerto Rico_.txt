The **Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico** (Spanish: *Código de Rentas Internas de Puerto Rico*) is the main body of domestic statutory tax law of Puerto Rico organized topically, including laws covering income taxes, payroll taxes, gift taxes, estate taxes, and statutory excise taxes.


## Sales and use tax

On July 4, 2006, the government approved Law 117, the 2006 Contributive Justice Law. It established a 5.5% state tax and an optional 1.5% municipal tax. It came into effect on November 15, 2006. The tax is better known as the *Impuesto sobre Ventas y Uso* (Sales and Use Tax) or by its Spanish acronym, IVU.

The law amended Article B of the Code and created sub-article BB.

On July 29, 2007, the government approved Law Number 80, making the tax mandatory for all municipalities of the commonwealth. Also, the tax rates changed to 6% at the state level and 1% at the municipal level.

In 2015, the Sales Tax and Use rate went from 7% to 11.5%.
