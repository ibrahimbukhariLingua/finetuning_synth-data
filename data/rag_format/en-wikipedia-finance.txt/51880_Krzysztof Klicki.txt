## Korona Kielce Football Club

Between the years 2002 - 2008, Klicki was a part-owner of Korona Kielce football club. However, on 2 April 2008 he announced the withdrawal of sponsorship of Korona Kielce. Dariusz W was employed by Krzysztof Klicki, owner of the Korona Kielce team's sponsor Kolporter, to reform the third division club, which was then on the verge of bankruptcy. He contributed significantly to Korona Kielce's advancement to the first division but, following Dariusz W's arrest, Kolporter decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the club. Klicki did this a few days after the Central Anticorruption Agency (CBA) and police arrested six individuals involved in setting up Korona's match results for bribes in the 2003/2004 season.
