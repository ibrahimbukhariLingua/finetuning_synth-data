American Manufacturing Council


# American Manufacturing Council



The **American Manufacturing Council** was a group of prominent chief executives set up to advise U.S. President Donald Trump on domestic manufacturing initiatives. It was chaired by Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical Company.

Following the withdrawal of several members after Trump's defense of alt-right protestors at the Unite the Right Rally, Trump on August 16, 2017 disbanded the Council, as well as the Strategic and Policy Forum. The council itself had earlier informed the president that they intended to disband on their own initiative.
