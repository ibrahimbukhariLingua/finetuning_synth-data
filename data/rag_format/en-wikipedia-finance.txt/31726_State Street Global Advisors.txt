## History

State Street Global Advisors, the asset management division of State Street Corporation, was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.

In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally: first London, 10 more international locations by 1994, with 15 by 1999.

SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY), which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number three ETF manager in the world after BlackRock and Vanguard.

Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.

As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.

* State Street Global Advisors launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX), which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
* In January 2011, State Street Global Advisors completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. State Street Global Advisors's presence in Ireland, which began 1996, had by 2010 grown to "more than 2,000 local employees."

State Street Global Advisors is among the signatories of the "Principles for a Responsible Civilian Firearms Industry," which seeks to engage firearms manufacturers, dealers, and retailers in promoting gun safety.

## *Fearless Girl*

In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, *Fearless Girl* by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon *Charging Bull*. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership. While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.


## Lawsuits

In October 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.

In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment. The case was settled in 2010.

In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.

In October 2017, SSGA agreed to pay over $5 million in back pay and interest to settle allegations the company underpaid women and African-American employees.
