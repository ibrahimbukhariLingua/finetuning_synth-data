The **Bohai Economic Rim** (**BER**) or **Bohai Bay Economic Rim** (**BBER**) is the economic region in China surrounding Tianjin (Tientsin). It also includes areas in Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong surrounding the Bohai Sea. This region has undergone major economic and infrastructural changes and is an emerging economic powerhouse of North China, rivaling both the Pearl River Delta in southern China and the Yangtze River Delta in eastern China.


## Economy

The Bohai Economic Rim has traditionally been involved in heavy industry and manufacturing. Tianjin's strengths have always been in aviation, logistics and shipping. Beijing complements this with strong petrochemical, education and R&D sectors. The area is becoming a significant growth cluster for the automobile, electronics, and petrochemical sectors, especially with Shenyang's automotive industry, software and aircraft, Dalian attracting foreign investments in manufacturing and Qingdao for its health services.

The Chinese central government has made it a priority to integrate all the cities in the Bohai Bay rim and foster economic development. This includes building an advanced communications network, better highways, increased education and scientific resources as well as tapping natural resources off the Bohai rim.

In recent decades, petroleum and natural gas deposits have been discovered in Bohai Sea.
