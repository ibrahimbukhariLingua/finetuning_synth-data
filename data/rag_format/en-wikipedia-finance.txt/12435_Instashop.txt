# Instashop



**instashop** (Arabic: إنستاشوب) is an online marketplace company headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, connecting users to trusted local shops. Founded in 2015 as an online grocery delivery platform, instashop offers today 21 shopping categories that cater to every user needs. In August 2020, instashop was acquired by Delivery Hero in one of the biggest exits in the region to date, making instashop one of the leading players in the emerging category of quick commerce. Currently, the company operates in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt.


## Overview

instashop was founded in 2015 in Dubai by two Greek entrepreneurs, Ioanna Angelidaki and John Tsioris, and is currently led by its CEO, Nikola Cabarkapa.

The company's app-based service allows users to order a wide range of daily essentials from supermarkets and local neighborhood retailers, offering both instant (30 to 60 mins) and scheduled delivery options.

Since its inception, instashop has expanded its network to include various local retailers across different shopping categories, such as pharmacies, butcheries, fresh produce markets, pet shops, flower shops, restaurants, bakeries, beauty shops, organic stores, electronics outlets and more.

Beyond its Business-to-customer (B2C) service, instashop also operates as a business-to-business (B2B) service, generating revenue through commissions paid by the shops it delivers from.


## History

During the second half of 2015, instashop negotiated its first fund-raising. The first round was around $365,000 in seed, while the public reached $750,000.

In October 2016, Souq.Com, one of the Gulf region e-commerce major companies, invested in InstaShop. On August 26, 2020, instashop announced its acquisition by Berlin-based Delivery Hero in a deal reportedly worth $360 million. instashop has continued to operate as an independent brand with no changes in its management.

In June 2021, instashop also started operating in Greece, with a trial run in Marousi, Athens.

In early November 2023, it was announced that founder John Tsioris was stepping down as CEO to be replaced by Nikola Cabarkapa, on November 17, 2023. On December 31, 2023, instashop ceased operations in Greece, following a letter from the company to its cooperating stores.
