Committee for Economic Development of Australia


# Committee for Economic Development of Australia



The **Committee for Economic Development of Australia** (**CEDA**) is a bipartisan, non-profit organisation providing thought leadership and policy perspectives on the economic and social issues affecting Australia, established in 1960.


## Foundation

The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) was formed in 1960 by Sir Douglas Copland, one of the most influential figures in Australian economics.

George Le Couteur OBE was president from 1968 until 1974. It was modelled on the US CED (Committee for Economic Development) but is now organised along lines more similar to the US Conference Board and the Conference Board of Canada. It is Australia's third-oldest think-tank, after the Institute of Public Affairs and the Australian Institute of International Affairs.

In 1979, after a debate on CEDA's involvement in lobbying, it established a "Business Roundtable" as an independent entity, which in 1983 was merged into the Business Council of Australia.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Aims and function

The expressed aim of CEDA is to "promote national economic development in a sustainable and socially balanced way". *Sydney Morning Herald* economics editor Ross Gittins has described CEDA as seeking to "inform the public debate without lobbying".ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

It is not influenced by political parties or vested interests, but remains independent.


## Governance and people

As of April 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Diane Smith-Gander AO is national president of CEDA, and Melinda Cilento is CEO.

It is financed by around 700 members drawn from businesses, universities, governments, and community groups and by a program of conferences and other events.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Neville Norman, later a professor at University of Melbourne, was economic advisor from 1975 to 1992.

John Nieuwenhuysen served as research director in the late 1980s, and became CEO in 1996. He expanded CEDA's collaborative research with Australian universities on issues such as tax and industrial relations reform.

Neil Warren, later a professor at the University of New South Wales, was research director from 1988 to 1990.


## Research approach

In 2018 CEDA identified its policy stack: technology and data; workplace, workforce and collaboration; population; critical services and institutions. Rather than identifying strongly with a particular ideological viewpoint in the style of the Centre for Independent Studies, the Institute of Public Affairs, or the Australia Institute, it mostly offers conclusions that are near the centre of the policy spectrum. It tends to favour market-oriented or at least price-oriented solutions to issues such as water supply and infrastructure.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
