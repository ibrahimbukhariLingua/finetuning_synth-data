It is responsible for the collection of value added tax, customs duties, excise duties, and other indirect taxes such as air passenger duty, climate change levy, insurance premium tax, landfill tax and aggregates levy.

## Customs emblem

The emblem was designed by a customs officer named Chen Tiebao (陈铁保) in 1951. The emblem consists of a golden key and the Caduceus of Hermes, crossing with each other. It was officially adopted on 1 October 1953. The emblem was not used from 1966 to 1985, as it was considered "too capitalist".
