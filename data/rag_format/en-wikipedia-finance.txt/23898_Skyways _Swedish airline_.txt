Skyways (Swedish airline)


# Skyways (Swedish airline)



**Skyways Express AB** was a Swedish airline that operated regional and domestic scheduled services. With its corporate head office on the property of Stockholm-Arlanda Airport in Sigtuna Municipality, Sweden, its main hub was at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport. The airline was placed into administration on 22 May 2012. Previously its head office was at Eurostop köpcenter, Cederströms slinga, Arlandastad.


## History

The airline was established in 1987 and was previously known as **Avia**. It acquired **Salair** on 15 July 1991, **Highland Air** in March 1997 and **Air Express** in 1999. A partnership was forged with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) which acquired a 25% stake in April 1998. The owners were Salenia (72.7%), SAS (25%) and Janus (2.3%). The operational division of Skyways was separated from the sales division in 2009. During 2010 there was some restructuring regarding ownership. SAS sold its share of the company at a loss, and eventually it was acquired by the asset management company Manswell Enterprises Limited, controlled by Ihor Kolomoyskyi. In 2011 Skyways merged with another Manswell controlled company, the Gothenburg-based airline City Airline, as Skyways. It also bought the Danish airline Cimber Sterling and developed the intention to become Scandinavia's biggest regional airline. As of December 1, 2010 the operation, sales and marketing of the airline functioned again as one unit under Avia Express continuing the use of the brand Skyways.

On 22 May 2012, Skyways Express AB and City Airline AB filed for bankruptcy; Cimber Sterling had filed for bankruptcy earlier that month.
