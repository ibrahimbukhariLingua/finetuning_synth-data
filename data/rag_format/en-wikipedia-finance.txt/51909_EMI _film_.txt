***EMI*** (Extension: ***Easy Monthly Installment - Liya Hai Toh Chukana Padega!***) is a 2008 Indian Hindi-language social comedy film directed by Saurabh Kabra and starred Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, Urmila Matondkar and Malaika Arora.


## Plot

Sattar (Sanjay Dutt), owner of Good Luck Recovery Agency, is the saviour and the solution for all those caught in the debt trap. From Bhaigiri to business to politics to social work—that's how Sattar wants to progress in life. He has already graduated from Bhaigiri to business and is now eager to jump into politics.

Most sought after by banks, telecom companies and various multinationals, today his Good Luck Recovery Agency is a leading recovery agency. Sattar follows a simple rule when it comes to his business—Loan liya hai to chukana padega.


## Reception

*EMI* received mostly negative reviews with *The Economic Times* saying that its release timing is apt but *EMI* 'fails to generate interest for its juvenile outlook towards the issue.' *Hindustan Times* also panned the movie giving it 1.5 stars out of 5 and commenting that "Sanjay Dutt is repeating his Munnabhai act till he makes your toes curl." This film was declared disaster at box office India.
