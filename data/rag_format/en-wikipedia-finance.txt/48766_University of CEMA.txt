## History


### Founding

The beginnings of the UCEMA date back to 1978, the year in which the Center for Macroeconomic Studies of Argentina (CEMA) began its activity. The CEMA, had the purpose of contributing to the dissemination of knowledge (especially diverse and modern economic theories). In 1980s, the center started its offering masters degrees in Economy & Business Administration. In the 1990s, the center started offering masters degrees in Finance, Bank Management, and Agribusiness.

### Links with the University of Chicago

In the late 1950s, there was a concern in the Argentine academic world regarding the participation in the development of economic theories that were taking place in various academic centers of international prestige. A preliminary idea was conceived in Chile, in 1955, through the creation of a joint economics program between the University of Chicago and the Catholic University of Chile. This agreement is notable as the program stipulated that, between the end of 1961 and the beginning of 1962, a similar program would be considered in Argentina.


#### Joint Initiative for Latin American Experimental Economics

The University of Chicago and UCEMA agreed to operate the Joint Initiative for Latin American Experimental Economics in the city of Buenos Aires. The Initiative is co-chaired by John List; Kenneth Griffin, Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago; and Julio Elías, Director of the Master's in Economics at UCEMA. The main objective of the Initiative is to design field experiments to offer new perspectives in various areas of economic research for Latin American countries, such as education, private provision of public goods, social preferences, environmental economics. The Initiative is based at UCEMA, where it welcomes visiting researchers from the Experimental Economics group at the University of Chicago and invited researchers from other universities working on related issues in Latin America.
