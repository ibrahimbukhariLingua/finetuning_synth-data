Member states of the Eurasian Economic Union


# Member states of the Eurasian Economic Union



The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) currently comprises 5 member states, which are party to the founding treaties of the EEU and thereby subject to the privileges and obligations of membership. The constituent states of the EEU are placed under binding laws and have equal representation within the EEU's executive and judicial bodies. They do however retain considerable autonomy, and must be unanimous for the EEU to adopt policies or new member states. Consensus is a founding principle of the EEU.

In 2000 six states created the EEU's predecessor, the Eurasian Economic Community. In 2010 three core states (Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan) pursued integration and founded the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space. The three states are the founding members of the Eurasian Economic Union. The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements. On 9 October 2014 Armenia signed the treaty and became the newest member state of the EEU on accession on 2 January 2015. Kyrgyzstan signed an accession treaty on 23 December 2014, which came into force on 6 August 2015.

Iran joined into a free trade agreement with the EEU in October 2018, following months of negotiations with Russia. The deal included 862 commodity items.

In order to accede, a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements. Enlargement of the Union is also subject to the consent of all existing members and the candidate's adoption of the existing body of EEU law and implementing previous decisions made by the Eurasian Commission, which become part of the EEU's regulatory framework.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
