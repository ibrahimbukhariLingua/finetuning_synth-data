List of stock exchange mergers in the Americas


# List of stock exchange mergers in the Americas



This is a **list of major stock exchange mergers and acquisitions** in the Americas. It also features the name of any resultant stock exchanges from mergers or acquisitions. According to Robert E. Wright of *Bloomberg* in 2013, historians assert that "rather than exhibiting a trend of constant consolidation, the number of exchanges active across the globe has waxed and waned several times over the past 200 years... During periods of heightened regulation, political turmoil or communication advances, exchanges tend to fail or merge. Economic prosperity, increased financial speculation and high levels of market uncertainty, by contrast, drive new entries."

The National Stock Exchange ceased trading operations on May 30, 2014, bringing the number of active stock exchanges in the United States to 11. *Bloomberg* wrote that this left "just one public exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange Inc., that isn’t owned by BATS, Nasdaq OMX Group or IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc."
