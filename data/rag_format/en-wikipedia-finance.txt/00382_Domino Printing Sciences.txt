## History

The company was founded by Graeme Minto in 1978 to exploit continuous inkjet technology (CIJ). By 1984 Domino had shipped its 1000th printer. It was first listed as DNO on the London Stock Exchange in 1985. In 1989 Domino moved to a new headquarters, located a few miles from Cambridge. In 1994 it acquired Directed Energy, a small laser marking business based in California, United States. In 2004 it acquired Wiedenbach, a supplier of ink jet printers, and Purex, a supplier of fume extractors for laser printers. In 2005, it acquired Sator, a supplier of laser printers. In 2006 it acquired Enterprise Information Systems, an RFID specialist.

In March 2015 Japan's Brother Industries announced it planned to buy Domino Printing Sciences PLC for £1.03 billion in cash ($1.55 billion). On 12 June 2015 Brother Industries announced it had formally completed the acquisition of Domino Printing Sciences plc.

After 22 years of success at technology manufacturer Domino Printing Sciences – including managing the sale of the FTSE250 company to Brother Industries in 2015 – CEO Nigel Bond, 61, passed on the management baton following his retirement at the end of March 2019. Robert Pulford, previously managing director of Domino’s Digital Printing Solutions Division, was appointed by the company to take over the CEO role.
