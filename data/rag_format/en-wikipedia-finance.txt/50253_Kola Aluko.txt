## Business career

Kola Aluko co-founded Besse Oil, a pioneering oil trading company in Nigeria in 1995. Besse Oil, one of the first to obtain a credit line with major international banks, traded crude oil and fuel oil, and was also a major importer of gasoline.

In partnership with the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) Atlantic Energy focused mainly on Niger Delta assets, contracted and executed under Strategic Alliance Agreements (SAAs) with the NPDC.


## Other interests

Kola Aluko is a co-founder of the Made in Africa Foundation (MiAF). It was established in 2011 (and incorporated in the UK in March 2012) by English fashion designer Oswald Boateng, Aluko and Atlantic Energy to support transformational and large scale African developments and infrastructure projects. Chris Cleverly (a cousin of UK Conservative MP and minister James Cleverly) was CEO of the foundation, and oversaw day-to-day operations; Boateng and Aluko were trustees and Atlantic Energy executive Dayo Okusami was a director of the foundation. On 26 September 2013, MiAF launched the Africa50 fund at New York's NASDAQ, Africa's largest infrastructure investment vehicle to date. MiAF, in alliance with the African Development Bank (AfDB), aimed to raise US$500 million for Africa50 by early 2014. The two institutions were supported by the investment expertise of Capri Global Capital - a US-based investment advisory founded by African-American fund manager Quintin E. Primo III.

Aluko, who is based in Nigeria and Switzerland, is a passionate motor sports enthusiast, who races and competes in conjunction with Swiss-based Ferrari team Kessel Racing. In December 2012, Aluko and his Kessel teammates Thomas Kemenater and Maurizio Mediani came third in the final round of the Endurance Champions Cup held at Rome's Vallelunga Circuit in Italy.

In interviews Aluko often cites the racing car driver Ayrton Senna as a main inspiration, drawing parallels between racing, business and life in general. When asked on his advice for young entrepreneurs, Aluko said, “The key is focus, focus and again focus. Identify the things you are good at, your strengths, and get to work on your weaknesses. The racing car driver Ayrton Senna, a man who inspired me greatly, is a good example. Senna was an exceptional driver, however, initially he was terrible in wet conditions, compared to racing in the dry. But he identified his weakness, and so every time it rained, he jumped into his car, and practiced, practiced, practiced, until he arguably became the best, wet weather driver in history."


## Controversies

In 2017, Aluko, co businessman Jide Omokore and former Nigeria Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke were being investigated for a series of multibillion-dollar fraud and money laundering offences in Nigeria, the United Kingdom and America. Between 2015 and 2017 Aluko sold a portion of his substantial overseas real estate holdings and the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture and recovery of approximately $144 million in assets alleged to be proceeds of corruption offenses laundered in the United States.
