Aviva Canada came into being on 31 March 1999 as the CGU Group Canada, and was created through the merger of the Commercial Union Assurance Company of Canada and the General Accident Assurance Company of Canada. The merger was the result of the 1998 merger of the mother companies, Commercial Union and General Accident, to form CGU plc. After CGU merged with Norwich Union in 2000 to form Aviva, the Canadian subsidiary changed its name to Aviva Canada.

The product is coupled with an online quoting tool that can provide a quote in less than 15 seconds for insurance limits from C$5,000 to C$50,000.
