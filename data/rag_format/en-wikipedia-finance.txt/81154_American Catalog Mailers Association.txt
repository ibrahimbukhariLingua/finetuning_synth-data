2) Suppliers and service providers to multi-channel retailers including printers, paper mills and brokers, list providers, cooperative databases, modeling providers, creative agencies, consultants, among others.


## History

The ACMA was formed in 2007 following a large increase in postal rates for catalog mail. Many catalog mailers believed these rate increased were made because their interests were not represented in the political process. Since its inception, the ACMA has had impact in two processes for setting postal rates, has testified before Congress and regulatory bodies, and has established relationships with the United States Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission, and members of the House of Representative and the Senate and Congressional staff.


## ACMA expertise

The ACMA has been called several times to testify before Congress on the impact of pending legislation. The media looks to the association for an understanding of how postal changes may affect the marketplace.
