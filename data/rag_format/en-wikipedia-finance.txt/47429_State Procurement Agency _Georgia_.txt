State Procurement Agency (Georgia)


# State Procurement Agency (Georgia)



The **State Procurement Agency** (Georgian: სახელმწიფო შესყიდვების სააგენტო, *sakhelmtsip’o shesqidvebis saagento*) is an independent legal entity of public law (LEPL) in Georgia that provides oversight to ensure the legitimacy of government procurement procedures by establishing policies for the regulation of the procurement process.

The legal bases for the Agency's operations are the Constitution of Georgia, the Georgian Law on State Procurement, international agreements and treaties, and the Agency regulations developed in accordance with those laws and treaties.

The structure and regulations of the Agency are subject to approval by the Government of Georgia, which exercises state control over the Agency's activities.


## Establishment of the Agency

The current State Procurement Agency is the second instance of such an agency in Georgia.

Initially, an independent State Procurement Agency had been established in 2001 by Decree 223 of the President of Georgia. The agency with which it was soon to be linked, the Free Trade and Competition Agency, was created in 2010 by Decree 143 of the President of Georgia. These two agencies were then merged into the Competition and State Procurement Agency, which was established, on 1 January 2012, by Decree 829 of the President of Georgia.

A new, independent State Procurement Agency was created on 31 March 2014, following the amendments of 21 March 2014 to the Georgian Law on State Procurement, which split the Competition and State Procurement Agency into two independent legal entities, the other being the Competition Agency.

### Dispute resolution board

To ensure full equity and transparency of state procurement procedures, the Procurement Related Disputes Resolution Board was created on 6 December 2010.

The Board consists of six members. The Board is made up of representatives of the State Procurement Agency and the NGO sector (civil society), based on the parity principle. The Board is chaired by the Chairman of the State Procurement Agency. The Chairman of the Agency appoints two members of the Board from among Agency employees. Three representatives of the NGO sector (civil society) are selected by as many representatives of the NGO sector as possible, to serve as members of the Board in rotation, for a one-year term, and the list of selected members is submitted to the secretariat of the Board.

An entity interested in participating in procurement, or a participant, may appeal actions of a procurement entity or a tender committee to the board, if it feels that during the procurement the rules set forth in the present law and relevant normative acts were violated and/or its rights were otherwise infringed.


## The Unified Electronic System of State Procurement

The Unified Electronic System of State procurement is the official online portal of state procurement in Georgia. It is meant to ensure an open, transparent and competitive environment for any participant in state procurement.

The Agency has been intensively working about a year to implement this electronic procurement system. It has been implemented with the technical assistance of the National Agency of Public Registry of Georgia. The relevant legal framework has been elaborated, the electronic tender software developed, and many other measures implemented that were necessary for the sustainable and safe operation of the system.

The system practically precludes corruption, increases the confidence and involvement of the society in state procurement, ensures fair competition, facilitates rational disbursement of administrative and financial resources, and saves time and money.
