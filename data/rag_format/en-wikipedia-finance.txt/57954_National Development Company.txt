The **National Development Company** (**NDC**) is a government-owned and controlled corporation attached to the Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines.


## History

In 1919, during the American colonial period, the National Development Company (NDC) was originally established as the Compañía de Fomento Nacional by Legislative Act 2489. It was later designated as a state-owned company by Commonwealth Act 182 in 1936.

With the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 1648 in 1979, the NDC was reorganized under a new charter and mandated to pursue commercial, industrial, agricultural, or mining ventures that would stimulate economic development in the Philippines.
