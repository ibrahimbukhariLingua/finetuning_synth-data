# Telekom Srbija



**Telekom Srbija a.d. Beograd** is a Serbian state-owned telecommunications operator. It was founded in May 1997 as a joint-stock company, by spinning off the telecommunications business from PTT Srbija (present-day Pošta Srbije). In April 2015, Telekom Srbija started providing all services in Serbia under the **mts** brand.

As of 2020,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ Telekom Srbija, combined with its Moja Supernova brand, is the largest Internet provider with a market share of 53.15%, the second largest cable operator with a market share of 44%, and the largest fixed-line telecommunication network with a market share of 77.5%. It is also the largest mobile operator with a market share of 37.27%.


## History

Telekom Srbija a.d. Beograd was set up in 1997, during the process of transformation of PTT sistema Srbije. In June that same year, it became the ownership of three shareholders – JP PTT Saobraćaja Srbija (present-day JP Pošta Srbije) (51%), Telecom Italia (29%), and OTE Greece (20%).


### 2003–2015

JP PTT saobraćaja Srbija (present-day JP Pošta Srbije) became the owner of 80% of the stake after purchasing the shares from the Italian partner, Telecom Italia in 2003.

In 2007, the Company regionally expanded into B-H and Montenegro. That same year, “Telekom Srpske“ a.d. Banja Luka and Društvo za telekomunikacije m:tel d.o.o. Podgorica were set up.

In August 2011, the company became the majority owner of Društvo za telekomunikacije HD WIN d.o.o. Beograd (Arena Sport TV Channels).

In January 2012, the company became the owner of 20% of the share capital which had been held by OTE Greece until then. That same year, the employees and former employees of Telekom Srbija a.d. Beograd, were presented with an opportunity to become owners of the shares.


### 2015–present

On 6 January 2015, Telekom Srbija acquired a 55.8 percent of shares in the Dunav banka, becoming its majority owner. Afterwards, the bank changed its name to "mts banka".

As of 2016, it is the largest broadband internet provider (45.9% market share) and the second largest cable television provider (25.0% market share) in Serbia.

In November 2018, Telekom Srbija bought domestic cable operator "Kopernikus Technology" for 190 million euros. The transaction made public outrage in Serbia as Kopenikus' market worth at the time of purchase was several times lower than the amount it was purchased for; it was also revealed that major stakeholder in company was a close relative to ruling Serbian Progressive Party officer. Month later, Kopernikus' former owner used much of that money for the purchase of B92 and Prva Srpska Televizija, two television networks with national coverage.

On 6 January 2019, Telekom Srbija acquired domestic cable operators Radijus Vektor and "AVcom", in a transaction worth 120 million euros.

In July 2019, Telekom Srbija acquired another regional cable operator "Telemark". Later in July, Euronews and HD-WIN (majority owned by Telekom Srbija) signed a deal to launch the "Euronews Serbia" news channel.
