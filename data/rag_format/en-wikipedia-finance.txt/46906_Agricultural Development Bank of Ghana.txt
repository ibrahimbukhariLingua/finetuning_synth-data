The main objective of the bank is promoting and financing of agribusiness in the country.


## History

ADB was established in 1965, by the Act of Parliament (Act 286) as the **Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Bank**. This is to meet the banking needs of the Ghanaian agricultural sector in a profitable manner. The Bank started operations from a building on Tunisia Road, West Ridge - Accra. The bank changed its name in 1970 when the parliamentary statute was amended to grant the institution full commercial banking powers.

In 1967, the National Liberation Council (NLC Decree 182) renamed the Bank from the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Bank to the Agricultural Development Bank and amended key sections of the Establishing Act, Act 286.

By 1990, the Bank became more diversified and added international banking and trade services to its growing product portfolio. The Bank obtained the Universal Banking license and broadened its services in 2004.

In 2011 the branch network of the bank expanded from 55 to 78 branches across the country with fully networked branches running on an ICT platform. Around the same time, the Bank introduced the ADB Visa Classic Card, allowing cardholders to transact business anywhere in the world.
