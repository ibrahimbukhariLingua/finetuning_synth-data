The book is dedicated to one of the most dramatic periods in the history of Soviet economic thought. It addresses the deep crisis that swept science in the context of administrative system formation and repression against prominent academic economists, and the first attempts to get out of this crisis related to the theoretical preparation of the economic reform of 1965 in the USSR. While analyzing the theory of the planned economy, the author reveals the inner logic of the development of science, the contradictions inherent in it, and quantum leaps, the relationship between political economy views and concepts of economic mechanism.

Moscow: Vagrius, 2001, also published by Oxford University Press under the title *The Challenge of Revolution: Contemporary Russia in Historical Perspective* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001). Co-authored with I.V. Starodubrovskaya. The book considers the events of 1985–2000 in Russia in the context of the great revolutions of the past — the English civil war, the French Revolution, and the Russian and Mexican revolutions in the early 20th century. The authors show that the post-communist transformation in Russia can be better understood based on historical analysis. It is proved that Russia experienced a full-scale revolution in the late 20th century, which, in its main features, is remarkably similar to the great revolutions of the past. This concept not only explains the causes and consequences of many key events in the country since 1985, but makes it possible to understand the logic of further events in contemporary Russia.
