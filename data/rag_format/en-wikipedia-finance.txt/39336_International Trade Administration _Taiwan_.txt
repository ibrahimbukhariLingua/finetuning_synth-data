# International Trade Administration (Taiwan)



The **International Trade Administration** (**ITA**; traditional Chinese: 經濟部國際貿易署; simplified Chinese: 经济部国际贸易署) is the administrative agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) of Taiwan (ROC).


## History

In 1955, the **Foreign Exchange and Trade Review Commission** (Chinese: 行政院外匯貿易審議委員會) was established under the Executive Yuan. In 1968 and 1969, the Executive Yuan reorganized the commission by dividing the authority and operation of the commission among the Ministry of Finance, MOEA and Central Bank of China, respectively. The **Bureau of Foreign Trade** was subsequently established on January 1, 1969, under the MOEA to administer trade in general commercial goods. It was later renamed as **International Trade Administration**.
