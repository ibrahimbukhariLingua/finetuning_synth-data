# China Zhongwang



**China Zhongwang Holdings Limited** (Chinese: 中国忠旺控股有限公司) (SEHK: 1333) is the second largest industrial aluminium extrusion product developer and manufacturer in the world and the largest in Asia and China. The company is headquartered in Liaoyang, China.


## Principal Businesses

China Zhongwang is principally engaged in the production of high precision, large-section and high value-added industrial aluminium extrusion products which are used in transportation (including railway passenger compartments and cargo carriages, metropolitan subway and light rail, automobiles, heavy trucks, vessels, aviation and aerospace) machinery and equipment and electric power engineering sectors. The company focuses on three core synergistic businesses; industrial aluminum extrusion, deep processing and aluminum flat rolling. The three core businesses operate together on the basis of upstream and downstream resource-sharing.


## History and Scale

China Zhongwang was founded in 1993. It now owns and operates over 90 aluminum extrusion production lines (including 21 production lines with large extrusion presses of 75MN or above). It has an annual production capacity of over 1.2 million tons. It was certified by the Chinese government as a “State Accredited Enterprise Technology Centre,” a “State CNAS Laboratory,” Liaoning Engineering and Technology Research Centre, and Liaoning Post-Doctoral Research Centre.

In 2011, China Zhongwang expanded into the business of advanced processing and fabrication of aluminium products and has since then developed a range of fabricated products, such as industrial aluminum pallets, aluminum high-speed train carriages for alpine regions, aluminum chassis for buses, as well as aluminum bodies and parts for passenger cars.

Since 2011, China Zhongwang started developing its flat rolling project. The flat rolling production base is in Tianjin, with an annual production capacity of 3 million tonnes.


## Recent Developments

In October 2011, China Zhongwang announced several major transactions related to the development of the synergistic aluminum flat rolled product business. It started the development of the project according to plan, and entered into a total of six equipment purchase agreements with three independent third party suppliers through two wholly owned subsidiaries. According to the agreements, China Zhongwang would invest approximately US$3.8 billion (about HKD29.5 billion) in total. The payment would be made in four installments between 2011 and 2014. The purchase would consist of hot and cold continuous rolling mills for the production of medium-to-high thickness plate and sheet products; smelting and casting lines; quenching furnaces and heat treatment furnaces. They would also include the ancillary production of medium-to-high thickness plate and sheet products, and aluminum foil rolling mills, among others.

As of August 30, 2021, Zhongwang Holdings Stock had been suspended from trade. This was due to the indictment brought by the United States alleging Zhongwang's "defrauded the United States out of $1.8 billion in tariffs due on Chinese imports."
