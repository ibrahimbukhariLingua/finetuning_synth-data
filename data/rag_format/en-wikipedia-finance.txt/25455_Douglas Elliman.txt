## History and overview

Douglas Elliman was founded in 1911, as a basement store at 421 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. The company was sold to the Milstein family (Seymour Milstein and Paul Milstein) in 1989 and then again to Insignia Financial Group (now CB Richard Ellis) in 1999.

In 2003, Insignia sold Douglas Elliman to Montauk Battery Realty, an affiliate of Vector Group's New Valley LLC subsidiary.

In 2012, the company dropped "Prudential" from its name, returning to its original 1911 name. It has a partnership with London-based Knight Frank LLP for residential business. Douglas Elliman affiliates include DE Property Management, DE Title and DE Capital Mortgage.

In December 2021 Douglas Elliman was spun off from Vector Group.
