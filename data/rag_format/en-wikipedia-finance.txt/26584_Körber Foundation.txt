Körber Foundation


# Körber Foundation



The **Körber Foundation** (German: ***Körber-Stiftung***) is a nonprofit organization, established in 1959 by German businessman Kurt A. Körber. Its operational work is organised into seven subject areas: ‘Age and Demography’, ‘Education’, ‘Democracy and Cohesion’, ‘History and Politics’, ‘International Politics’, ‘Culture’ and ‘Science’. The foundation is nationally and internationally active with its own projects and events at its locations in Hamburg's Hafencity, Bergedorf and Berlin.

The foundation is a corporate investment foundation: it is the sole shareholder of Körber AG, the strategic holding company of the Körber Group. It receives an annual dividend from its investment, which it uses exclusively for charitable purposes. The foundation's assets amount to around 580 million euros, of which 556 million euros is equity.


## Committees

The foundation has an executive board, a foundation board and a board of trustees. The executive board is responsible for fulfilling the objectives of the statutes through operational work and funding. The members of the executive board are Thomas Paulsen, as chairman, and Eva Nemela. The foundation board has the task of monitoring the charitable activities of the executive board. The Board of Trustees monitors the foundation's asset management and decides on the exercise of rights in companies in which the foundation holds more than 20 per cent of the capital.

At the KörberForum in Hamburg's Hafencity and the KörberHaus in Hamburg-Bergedorf, the foundation hosts around 100 free events a year that address current social issues.


## Criticism

Connections between Körber Foundation and politics have been described as too close by some media. A history contest, organized by the foundation, has been under the patronage of the President of Germany. Government politicians have been members of advisory councils for foundation awards and similar activities. According to critics, such connections violate guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the relations between governments and tobacco industry. However, affected politicians have pointed out the foundation's reputation and the social value of its projects.
