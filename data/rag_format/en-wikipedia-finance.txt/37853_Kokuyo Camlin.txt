## History

Camlin was established in 1931 by D. P. Dandekar and his brother G. P. Dandekar starting operations as "Dandekar & Co." with "Horse Brand" Ink powders and tablets in 1931, and shortly started producing "Camel ink" for fountain pens. It was incorporated as a private company in 1946, and then turned into a public limited company in 1998.

In 2011, Japanese stationery major, "Kokuyo Co. Ltd", acquired a 50.74% stake in Camlin, the leading Indian manufacturer by then. Kokuyo paid ₹366 crore for the acquisition. Dilip Dandekar continued as chairman and managing director of the company. The deal intended to facilitate the entry of Kokuyo products, mainly paper and office stationery into the Indian market. On the other hand, Camlin aimed to increase its exports to other countries.

At the moment of the deal, Camlin had more than 2,000 products, mainly pencils, pastels, inks and markers. Also, Kokuyo retained the Camlin (writing implements and office side) and Camel (art materials side) brands.
