## History

National Beef was formed in 1992 when Farmland Industries purchased a Dodge City, Kansas slaughterhouse. A year later, it purchased a location in Liberal, Kansas and named it Farmland National Beef LLC. In 1997, U.S. Premium Beef Ltd purchased a minority interest in National Beef. The company became jointly owned by Farmland Industries and U.S. Premium Beef Ltd. National Beef also purchased a majority interest in the Kansas City Steak Company. In 2001, National Beef began consumer-ready production at plants in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania and Moultrie, Georgia. In 2003, National Beef also became the fourth largest U.S. beef processor in 2003. U.S. Premium Beef Ltd purchased a majority interest along with a management group and Beef Products Inc. as minority investors, forming National Beef Packing Co. LLC.

In 2006, National Beef acquired Brawley Beef, LLC in Brawley, California. The Brawley plant was built in 2001 and could process more than 400,000 cattle per year. National Beef stated the purchase would allow them to create new relationships with producers and expand their presence in the western U.S. The Brawley plant was eventually closed in 2014. Three years later, National Beef acquired the Prime Tanning facility in St. Joseph, Missouri to form National Beef Leathers LLC. After the acquisition, the company said it would allow them to add significant value to the hides produced in their beef processing facilities. In 2011, Leucadia National Corporation purchased a majority stake in National Beef Packing Company. Five years later, National Beef announced plans to expand handling and shipping capacities to its Dodge City and Liberal, Kansas facilities. In 2018, Brazilian company Marfrig purchased a 51 percent majority stake in the company in April for $969 million. Through the purchase, a beef patty processing plant located in North Baltimore, Ohio, was added to National Beef's portfolio. One year later, National Beef acquired Iowa Premium, LLC, in Tama, Iowa.
