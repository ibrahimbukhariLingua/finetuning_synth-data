## Early life and education

Patrick Sergeant was born on 17 March 1924 in King's Down, Kent. He was the son of George Sergeant, a coal merchant, and Rene Sergeant, a converted Roman Catholic. He attended Beaumont College after his mother insisted on it over his father's preference for Harrow.

During World War II, Sergeant served as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) from 1945 to 1948, where he was stationed on corvettes. After his military service, Sergeant joined Mullens & Co. a stockbroking firm and the official government broker in the bond market, with assistance from his aunt.

His transition to journalism occurred after meeting Oscar Hobson, the City editor of the *News Chronicle* which he joined as a reporter in 1948. In 1953, he joined the Daily Mail, where he became joint deputy City editor. His writing led to a regular column on his travels in the Soviet Union, which was later expanded into the book *Another Road to Samarkand* (1955). He worked for the *Daily Mail* until 1984. Later, he served as a director of Daily Mail and General Trust Plc from 1992 to 2004.

In 1969, with financial backing from Viscount Rothermere, Sergeant launched *Euromoney*. In 1984, Sergeant was knighted by then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

Sergeant took retirement from the board of *Euromoney* in 2018.
