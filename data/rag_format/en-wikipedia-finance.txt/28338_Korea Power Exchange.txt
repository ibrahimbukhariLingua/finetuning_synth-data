Korea Power Exchange


# Korea Power Exchange



**Korea Power Exchange** (Korean: 한국전력거래소), also known as **KPX**, is the quasi-governmental agency under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy responsible for operating the electricity market and the electric power system in South Korea. To ensure fair and transparent operation of the market, as well as stable and efficient operation of the grid, it was established in April 2001 by being spun off from the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) as a part of the industry restructuring efforts. Because the legal name (**한국전력**거래소) may give a false impression that it is a subsidiary of KEPCO (**한국전력**공사), the general name of **전력거래소** is used for most purposes.


## Establishment

Article 35 of the Electric Utility Act (EUA) amended on 23 December 2000, laid out the legal basis of the organization. Following the founders' meeting on 17 March 2001, it was officially founded on 2 April 2001. The original offices were located within the KEPCO headquarters building complex in Samseong-dong, Seoul until the relocation to Naju Innovation City took place in 2014.
