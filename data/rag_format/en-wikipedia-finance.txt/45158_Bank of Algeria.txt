Bank of Algeria


# Bank of Algeria



The **Bank of Algeria** (Arabic: بنك الجزائر, French: *Banque d'Algérie*) is the central bank of Algeria. The bank is located in Algiers and its current governor is Salah Eddine Taleb. It was established following Algerian independence in 1962 by Seghir Mostefai, expert for the "Exécutif provisoire" and member of the Algerian delegation at Evian negotiations, to take over the former activities in the country of the Banque de l'Algérie, the colonial central bank of French Algeria.

The Bank of Algeria sets the conditions under which banks and financial institutions in Algeria and abroad can be allowed to be in Algeria and to operate there. It establishes, moreover, the conditions under which such authority may be amended or withdrawn.

The organization of the bank includes the Conseil de la Monnaie et du Crédit, the Commission Bancaire (Banking Commission) and the Bank of Algeria itself.
