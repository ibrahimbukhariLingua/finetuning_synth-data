## Career


### Wall Street years

Harmon worked on Wall Street for 38 years. He spent 15 years at broker-dealer New York Hanseatic Corp, and in 1974 he joined investment banking firm Wertheim & Co. as chairman of the investment banking committee. He was vice chairman at Wertheim when he had a chance meeting with old friend and Schroder’s director Alva Way on a flight from London to New York; the ensuing conversation led to Schroder’s acquisition of a half interest of the firm in 1986. The firm was renamed Wertheim Schroder & Co. The transaction allowed Wertheim to stabilize its capital base and gave the firm access to Schroder’s client base in Europe and Asia. In 1990, Wertheim Schroder sold 4.9% non-voting interests to Bank of Boston, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, as a way to continue growing without expanding the firm. Harmon served as chairman and CEO of Wertheim Schroder from 1986 until the end of 1995, and was the senior chairman until June 1997. He served on the board of a number of U.S. and U.K. public companies.


### Export-Import Bank of the United States

On May 6, 1997, President Bill Clinton nominated Harmon for president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which makes billions in loan guarantees to developing nations to purchase goods and services from the US. The US Senate confirmed the nomination on June 12, 1997. At the time, there was an emerging markets crisis, fueled by the collapse of Thailand’s currency, which affected other countries in the region, and large credit defaults in Russia and Latin America. Harmon was confident that the emerging markets economy would soon recover. Due to these market conditions during Harmon’s tenure, the focus of the bank’s loan guarantees went from government-related to private ventures. Harmon’s term was to end in January 2001 but he was asked to extend his term through May 2001 by Vice President Dick Cheney.


### Caravel Management LLC

His stint as head of the Ex-Im Bank was Harmon’s introduction to frontier markets. In October 2004, Harmon founded Caravel Management, where he serves as chairman and chief investment officer. The New York-based firm invests in special situations in frontier and emerging markets, currently in Egypt and Zimbabwe.


### World Resources Institute

In 2004, Harmon was elected chairman of the World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent nonprofit organization founded in 1982, focused on global environmental policy research and analysis. WRI has over 1400 employees, and in addition to its main office in Washington, DC, WRI maintains offices in China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Ethiopia, Brazil and a European headquarters in The Hague.


### Egyptian-American Enterprise Fund

Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution, President Barack Obama pledged $1 billion in economic aid to Egypt. In July 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to Egypt to meet newly elected President Mohamed Morsi. During this visit, Clinton announced that Harmon would head the new Egyptian-American Enterprise Fund ("EAEF"). Secretary of State John Kerry announced in March 2013 that the Egyptian-American Enterprise Fund would be launched by the US. In an effort to boost Egypt’s ailing economy, the fund was to invest in small- and medium-sized Egyptian businesses. The fund was officially launched on April 24, 2013. In 2015, the EAEF made its first two major investments in Fawry, an electronic payments platform and Sarwa Capital, a consumer finance company, which help to promote financial inclusion in Egypt.

In June 2017, Harmon testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the achievements of EAEF to date, offering praise for Egypt’s economic reform agenda, and encouraging Congress to explore how enterprise funds can be incorporated into the U.S. foreign policy apparatus. He reiterated these comments in an op-ed later that summer when members of Congress and the Trump administration considered cutting foreign aid to Egypt over human rights concerns. In the EAEF’s 2017 annual report, Harmon stated that the “EAEF has invested 180 million and grown its portfolio to include four private companies and three investment funds….[and] attracted an additional USD 130 million from foreign institutional investors, doubling the impact of our efforts….and created more than 500 jobs.” Congress has authorized $300 million for investment in the Fund.

In August 2018, the Center for Strategic and International Studies ("CSIS") released a report, entitled "Time for a Third Wave of Enterprise Funds," which highlighted the success of the Egyptian American Enterprise Fund and advocated for a new set of enterprise funds to be created in Central America, southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

In April 2019, David Ignatius of the *Washington Post*, published an opinion piece on the EAEF, "The story of a private-equity fund shows how a U.S.-Egypt reset could begin."


### Politics

Harmon served as finance chairman for incumbent New York Mayor David Dinkins’ unsuccessful 1993 campaign for reelection. Harmon was Dinkins’ second-highest fundraiser, raising $155,300 for the mayor’s campaign. Harmon helped raise over $100,000 for President Bill Clinton’s successful 1996 campaign for reelection.
