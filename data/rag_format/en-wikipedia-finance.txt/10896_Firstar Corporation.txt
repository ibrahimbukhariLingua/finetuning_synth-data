Firstar Corporation


# Firstar Corporation



**Firstar Corporation** was a Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based regional bank holding company that existed from 1853 to 2001. In 2001, Firstar acquired U.S. Bancorp and assumed its name, moving its headquarters to Minneapolis.


## History

Firstar was founded in 1853 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as Farmer's and Millers Bank. It became First Wisconsin National Bank in 1919 as a result of internal evolution as well as mergers.


### First Wisconsin Corporation

In 1929, First Wisconsin reorganized as a holding company, **Wisconsin Bankshares Corporation**, for the purpose of acquiring other banks. The holding company was renamed **First Wisconsin Bankshares Corporation** in 1960. In 1974, the name of holding company was changed again to **First Wisconsin Corporation** and finally to **Firstar Corporation** in 1988. Some of the subsidiary banks did not adopt its parent's new corporate name until as late as 1992 when the First Wisconsin brand was finally retired.

First Wisconsin constructed a new 42 stories tall headquarters building in Milwaukee that was called the First Wisconsin Center and is the tallest building in Wisconsin. This building was opened in 1973.

Unusual for a small regional bank, First Wisconsin was active during the 1970s and 1980s in lending money to companies in South America to assist those companies in the purchase of American products. Because of First Wisconsin's involvement in the international loan market, First Wisconsin became involved in the Latin American debt crisis and lost some money when some of their clients defaulted.

By the end of 1997, some stock market analysts speculated that Firstar was a prime takeover candidate based upon the performance of its stock in recent months and in view of the recent acquisition of First of America by National City and rumors of Banc One was in the process of acquiring First Chicago NBD.

Under the merger agreement, Jerry Grundhofer, president and chief executive officer of Firstar, would continue in those positions in the combined company while his older brother, John Grundhofer, chairman, president and chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp, would serve as chairman of the board in the combined company until his planned retirement on December 31, 2002. While Firstar was the nominal survivor, the merged company took the more recognizable U.S. Bancorp name and moved to U.S. Bancorp's old headquarters in Minneapolis.

To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices.

To this day, U.S. Bancorp retains Star Banc/Firstar's pre-2000 stock price history. All of present-day U.S. Bancorp's SEC filings before 1998 are under Star Banc, and all filings from 1998 to 2000 are under Firstar.
