## History

LEAP Legal Software was founded in 1992 by Christian Beck. In 2008, LEAP acquired LegalPax, a provider of automated forms and precedents to law firms in Queensland. At the beginning of 2010, LEAP launched a cloud software called LEAP Expedite. It also purchased BING! Software, a family law precedents business. LEAP Office 10 was launched at the NSW State Legal Conference in August 2010. In 2012, LEAP Expedite was replaced with a rewritten cloud product. LEAP began rolling out the cloud version of its software to law firms in Australia in January 2013.

LEAP expanded to the UK and US markets in 2014 and 2015.

LEAP 365 was the first software-as-a-service legal application for the Australian market. LEAP 365 was released for the UK and US markets at an event at Yankee Stadium on September 12, 2016.

In 2019, LEAP entered into a joint venture with LexisNexis Legal Professional to operate PCLaw | Time Matters.

LEAP expanded to Canada in 2020 and to New Zealand in 2022.

In 2024, a Melbourne lawyer using LEAP's AI software was referred to complaints body after AI generated made-up case citations in family court.
