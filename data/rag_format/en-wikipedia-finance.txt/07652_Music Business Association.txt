Music Business Association


# Music Business Association



The **Music Business Association** (**Music Biz**), formerly known as the **National Association of Recording Merchandisers** (NARM), is a not-for-profit trade association based in Nashville, Tennessee. It hosts in-person and virtual events related to music business, offering educational materials, and fostering engagement opportunities for its members. Music Biz's membership includes major and independent record labels, streaming services, music retailers, distributors, music tech companies and startups, publishers, lawyers, and all others involved in the sale of music and related merchandise. Representing more than 90 percent of the industry at large, Music Biz provides opportunities for collaboration between professionals from all subsets to invest in the future of the entire music business while also addressing each business segment's individual needs.


## History

Established in 1958 as the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), the Association changed its name to the Music Business Association in October 2013 while also folding in digitalmusic.org, its home for online music initiatives. According to James Donio, the Association's president at the time of the rebrand, the change was made because "more segments of the business than ever before now play an active role in the commerce side of the business, so the name 'National Association of Recording Merchandisers' no longer reflected everyone who can participate in the organization... for the first time in the organization's history, the 'M' stands for music."


### Response to COVID-19 pandemic and calls for social justice

With the COVID-19 pandemic effectively shutting down all in-person events and conferences for the better part of two years, Music Biz was not able to host its Annual Conference in 2020 or 2021. Instead, the organization pivoted its normal annual programming into a slate of more than 70 virtual events spread across the two-year period. This included the debut of its Music Biz LIVE interview series held over Zoom. These hour-long talks initially served as a way to check in with various music industry subsets on how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting them and what responses they took to combat its effects on their businesses and personnel.

In addition, Music Biz hosted virtual, standalone versions of its most popular programming blocks from its Annual Conference, including its Metadata Summit, Podcasting Summit, Financial Literacy Summit, and #NEXTGEN\_NOW young industry professionals event, among others. It also held four editions of the #NEXTGEN\_U summit, programmed with discussions that support the specific needs of music business students and educators.

In response to the calls across the music industry for a renewed focus on social justice initiatives and DEI efforts, Music Biz partnered with a number of organizations including Nashville Music Equality, the National Museum of African American Music (NMAAM), to host forums where the difficult conversations around ending racism in the music industry and supporting a global shift towards acceptance and equity. These included its first-ever "Driving Change" event, a handful of Music Biz LIVE interviews, and standalone events which focused on the needs of minority communities and what steps music industry executives could do in the present to institute meaningful change.

Outside of events, the Association prepared a running list of resources their members and the industry at large could use to support themselves during the height of the pandemic. These included government grant applications, funding for mental health services, and links to community chats for industry professionals to support one another's business endeavors or personnel needs.
