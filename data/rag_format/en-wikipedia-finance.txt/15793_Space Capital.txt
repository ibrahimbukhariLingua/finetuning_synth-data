# Space Capital



**Space Capital LP** is an early-stage venture capital firm that invests exclusively in space-based technologies. Formed in 2017 it is based in New York City. Space Capital is the parent brand of Space Angels, an online angel investment platform, and Space Talent, a career platform and central node for space industry jobs.


## History

Originally founded in 2007 as an angel investor network, the firm's scale was limited by its informal structure. In 2012, Chad Anderson became CEO and by 2015 transitioned Space Angels away from the decentralized investing model typical of angel networks. In 2015, Anderson re-founded the company and launched its first special purpose vehicle (SPV) fund.

In 2017, Space Capital launched its first institutional venture capital fund of $16 million, with Tom Ingersoll joining as partner. The firm has since grown to three funds and over $100 million under management. Their investments are focused on space-based technologies such as GPS, geospatial intelligence, and satellite communications.

In 2020, Space Capital formalized its brand architecture with Space Capital as the parent brand and Space Angels (founded in 2007), an online angel investment platform, and Space Talent, a career platform and central node for space industry jobs, as its sub-brands.
