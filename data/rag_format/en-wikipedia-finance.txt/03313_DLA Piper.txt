DLA Piper


# DLA Piper



**DLA Piper** is a law firm with offices in over 40 countries across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

It was founded in 2005 through the merger between three law firms: San Diego–based *Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP*, Baltimore-based *Piper Rudnick LLP* and United Kingdom–based *DLA LLP*. DLA Piper is now composed of multiple partnerships operating under a shared global network in an organizational structure known as a Swiss Verein.


## History


### Origins

DLA Piper's origins can be traced back to four law firms: Dibb Lupton Broomhead, Alsop Stevens, Piper & Marbury, and Rudnick & Wolfe. Dibb Lupton Broomhead was a UK law firm that was formed in 1988 after the merger of Dibb Lupton and Broomhead & Neals. In 1996, the firm merged with the Liverpool-based law firm, Alsop Wilkinson, and became Dibb Lupton Alsop (DLA). Meanwhile, in the United States, Piper & Marbury was founded in Baltimore, Maryland, and merged with Chicago-based Rudnick & Wolfe in 1999 to form Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe.


### Formation and growth (2005–2010)

DLA Piper was formed in 2005 after a merger between DLA, Piper Rudnick, and Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich. The merger created one of the largest law firms in the world at the time and the largest firm in the UK. In 2006 the firm's name was shortened from DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP to DLA Piper. In 2005, DLA Piper launched New Perimeter, an international pro bono initiative that provides legal assistance in underserved regions.

Throughout this period, the firm continued to open offices in Mexico City and São Paulo, as well as expanding its presence in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. The firm also grew in the Australasian region through a series of mergers and acquisitions, including an exclusive alliance with Australian firm Phillips Fox in 2006. Also in 2006, DLA Piper expanded its Middle Eastern presence by opening an outpost in Doha, Qatar, later opening an office in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 2008.

In 2008, DLA Piper opened an office in Kuwait as a joint venture with Kuwaiti law firm Al Wagayan, Al Awadhi & Al Saif to provide legal services to international and local clients operating under the DLA Piper Kuwait moniker.
In the US, the firm expanded into markets such as Houston, Texas, where it opened a practice focused on energy law in 2008.

## Political contributions

According to OpenSecrets, DLA Piper employees donated $2.19 million to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, 73% to Democrats.

## Controversy

In 2010, DLA Piper represented Paul Ceglia in his claim that he hired Mark Zuckerberg to create a website that became Facebook and that under the agreement, Ceglia was entitled to ownership of 84 percent of Facebook, then worth multiple billions of dollars. Zuckerberg and Facebook responded that Ceglia had hired Zuckerberg to work on an unrelated site, but Ceglia had fraudulently altered that contract to make it appear to cover Facebook. A DLA Piper attorney told the *Wall Street Journal* that although he had not seen the original document, he had "absolutely 100% confidence that [Mr. Ceglia's] agreement is authentic." Ceglia's document was later found to be fraudulent, and in 2014, Facebook and Zuckerberg sued DLA Piper and others, claiming Ceglia's lawyers "knew or should have known that the [initial] lawsuit was a fraud." The suit was later dismissed.

In June 2020, Squire Patton Boggs filed *Ferrellgas Partners LP et al. v. DLA Piper LLP US* in Kansas, on behalf of former firm client Ferrellgas, for a breach of fiduciary duty.
