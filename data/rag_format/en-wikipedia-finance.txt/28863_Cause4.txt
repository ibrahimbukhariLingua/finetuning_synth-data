# Cause4



***Cause4*** is one of the UK's first B Corporations that works in partnership with the charity sector, corporates and philanthropists in the United Kingdom and internationally. It was launched in May 2009 and aims to be a modernising influence within the charity sector. The company works with long-established national charities as well as smaller local charities and recently established social enterprises, both as a fundraiser and strategy consultant. *Cause4* also specialises in developing philanthropic foundations for individuals and companies and implementing company social responsibility strategies.

In 2010 *Cause4* developed a training programme through which to address the shortage of development and fundraising personnel within the charity, arts, sports and education sectors. This programme became known as the *Cause4* Entrepreneurship programme in March 2013. The company also hosts a range of fundraising, creative and digital apprenticeships.

Other graduate development programmes led by *Cause4* include a Fellowship programme for the Arts Fundraising and Philanthropy Programme funded by Arts Council England and development of a Creative Entrepreneurs programme for start up creative businesses in partnership with the Guildhall School of Music & Drama
