## History


### 1972–1990

Founders Marvin and Helene Gralnick met in 1972 while living in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 1983, they opened a tiny Mexican folk art gift shop in Periwinkle Place on Sanibel Island, Florida. Helene named the shop **F**olk **A**rt **S**pecialties and then changed the name to Chico's Folk Art Specialties after a friend's pet parrot, Chico. The store sold mostly art, but the sweaters in the store outsold everything else, so Chico's Folk Art Specialties transformed into a clothing boutique.

In 1985, Chico's Folk Art Specialties opened a second boutique on Captiva Island, Florida. All early boutiques were infused with Mexican folk art combined with antiques and fixtures manufactured in Marvin's in-house woodshop.

In the beginning, Marvin and Helene would not close the store until they reached a certain amount of sales each day. They also could not afford to have bags printed, so the name was handwritten on each bag.

The first franchise store opened in Edina, Minnesota, in 1987. In 1989, the company shortened its name to Chico's FAS (an abbreviation for Folk Art Specialties) and launched the Passport Loyalty Rewards program.


### 1991–2000

By 1992, the company operated 60 boutiques and began designing its own prints and patterns.

Chico's FAS went public in 1993 and began trading on NASDAQ under the title CHS. It premiered its Most Amazing Personal Service (MAPS) customer service initiative in 1998, which still remains as part of the company's focus as of 2018. Between 1998 and 2000, Chico's sales increased an average of 50 percent per year. In 2010, Chico's FAS began online sales at Chicos.com. It also began advertising in national magazines, including *Martha Stewart Living* and *Marie Claire*.


### 2001–2010

In 2001, the Chico's FAS Founders building opened in Fort Myers, Florida, and Chico's FAS debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.

Chico's FAS aired its first commercial in six major markets on *The Today Show*, *Good Morning America*, *The Oprah Winfrey Show*, and *Martha Stewart Living*.

Average new store sales reached $1.45 million per year in 2003. The next year, Chico's FAS acquired White House Black Market, a women's clothing company that focuses on white, black, and other variants of the two colors. Chico's FAS also launched Soma, an intimate apparel boutique.

In 2006, Chico's FAS added 24 acres to the Fort Myers campus to support growth, and stock reached a high of $49.40.


### 2011–present

In 2011, Chico's FAS acquired Boston Proper, which is a brand available online or by catalog. Two years later, Boston Proper opened its first boutique at Coconut Point in Estero, Florida.

In 2013, Chico's FAS expanded internationally by opening White House Black Market stores in Canada. On May 13, 2014, Chico's FAS announced expansion of the Chico's brand into Canada. Three boutiques have since opened in Canada. Further international expansion has occurred with its namesake Chico's into Mexico in 2014. Through an exclusive franchise with El Puerto de Liverpool ("Liverpool"), Chico's opened a stand-alone boutique at Perisur Mall, Mexico City. Plans for further Chico's expansion into Mexico include more openings of stand-alone boutiques as well as branded shop-in-shops in Liverpool department stores.

In 2016, Chico's FAS sold Boston Proper to Brentwood Associates, an investment firm in Los Angeles.

In 2017, the company launched its first online outlet store, Chico's Off The Rack. Also in 2017, the company Chico's began selling on cruise ships through Princess Cruises and Starboard Cruise Services. In 2019, Chico's announced it was opening airport stores in partnership with airport retailer operator Stellar Partnerships. The company also started selling online through Amazon and ShopRunner.
