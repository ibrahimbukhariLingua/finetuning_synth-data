## History

In the beginning of August 2019, it was announced that Mr. Aybars Balabaner, a German citizen, would invest in the new airline. Onur Air (via Mr. Balabaner) provided the new airline with its first aircraft – an Airbus A321 – and it would continue to support the airline technically and logistically until further notice. Aybars Balabaner owned 95% of Holiday Europe Ltd., the other 5% was owned by Managing Director Petko Christoff. In the end of December 2021, Holiday Europe had a new Ownership, Jet Sky Ltd. that owned 90% of shares of Mr. Aybars Balabaner. On 24 August 2019, the airline received its Air Operating Certificate (AOC).
