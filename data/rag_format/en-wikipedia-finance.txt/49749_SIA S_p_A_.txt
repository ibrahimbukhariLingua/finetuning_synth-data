**SIA S.p.A.** is an Italian company operating in the area of ICT, providing services to the banking and finance sector in addition to platforms for financial markets and e-payment services.


## History

The company was founded in 1977 as ***Società Interbancaria per l'Automazione*** by Banca d'Italia, ABI and a pool of Italian banks. During the 1980s, SIA created the *Rete Nazionale Interbancaria* (RNI – national interbank network) and contributed to developing the interbank payments system in compliance with the white paper on payment systems in Italy, published by Banca d’Italia in 1987.

In 1983 SIA launched Bancomat and in 1987 introduced POS payments.

In 1992, from a branch of SIA's business, SSB - *Società per i Servizi Bancari* was born, a firm specializing in services in the field of electronic money. The new company worked on further developments in payment cards: Bancomat/Pagobancomat, FASTpay, borsellino elettronico (e-purse with the MINIpay product) and the Microcircuito project for the migration from magnetic stripe cards to microchip cards.

In 1999, SIA merged with Cedborsa, changing its name to "Società Interbancaria per l'Automazione - Cedborsa S.p.A.", working on the automation of the Borsa Italiana markets and the launch of the Italian gross payments markets e-MID and MTS.

In 2003, SIA developed the interbank payments system in Romania, a condition for the country's entry into the European Union.

In the early 2000s, SIA created and managed the technology platform for the STEP2 project, the first continental ACH (automated clearing house) for retail payments in euros.

In the same period, SIA created RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement System) platforms for the central banks of Sweden, Norway, Egypt and Palestine.

In May 2007, the merger between SIA and SSB gave birth to SIA-SSB S.p.A., a name simplified in 2011 to SIA S.p.A.

In 2012, in partnership with Colt, SIA was awarded the tender announced by the European Central Bank and becomes a licensed Network Service Provider appointed to create the network infrastructure connecting central securities depositaries (CSD), central banks in the Eurosystem and major bank groups at European level to TARGET2-Securities (T2S).

A year later, together with the same partner, SIA won the tender announced by Deutsche Bundesbank (which was also operating on behalf of Banca d’Italia, Banque de France and Banco de España) to create the network infrastructure linking the four central banks charged with managing the single platform of the Eurosystem to settle large payments and securities transactions.

Over the course of 2013, SIA incorporated its Belgian subsidiary SiNSYS, a company operating in the processing of payment cards, and acquired Emmecom, an Italian firm in the sector of fixed, mobile and satellite telecommunications networks.

In the area of mobile payments, during 2014 SIA launched a service called Jiffy for sending and receiving cash in real time to and from a user's contacts by smartphone.

At the end of 2014, SIA incorporated its subsidiary RA Computer and the payments Gateway business of its TSP subsidiary. This led to the direct control of payment institution PI4PAY (effective from July 2011).

UBIS also signed with SIA a ten-year outsourcing contract for the supply of processing services for transactions made using debit, credit and prepaid cards, and for the management of POS and ATM terminals.

In the final part of 2016, SIA launched a series of partnerships in the e-payments market: American Express Italia has chosen SIA to launch a completely digital and paperless service to support the request for new credit cards. This project uses authentication and digital signature systems to request a card in paperless mode.

Following this agreement, SIA S.p.A. on January 1, 2017 established two new companies: P4cards S.r.l., based in Verona, and Pforcards GmbH, based in Vienna, to manage the payment cards processing activities.

In the spring of 2017 the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) has chosen SIA to implement and support the new real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) and the new instant payment platform. These technology infrastructures developed by SIA, planned to go live in 2018, will replace CBI's current mainframe-based real-time solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for high and low-value payment systems, which have been operating since 2001.
