Solar Energy Industries Association


# Solar Energy Industries Association



The **Solar Energy Industries Association** (**SEIA**), established in 1974, is the American national non-profit trade association of the solar-energy industry in the United States. In 2019, the group reported at least 1,000 member companies.

SEIA is a 501(c)6 non-profit trade association. The association supports the extension of a 30 percent federal solar investment tax credit for eight years.

With the recent high flux of green jobs in the solar industry, SEIA maintains a resource for those looking for solar jobs. The Harvard Business Review claims that the solar industry could absorb all of the jobs lost to the coal industry as it shutters. By 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the solar industry employed more workers in the energy generation industry than all fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) combined.

An independent but strategically aligned organization, The Solar Foundation, is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization which develops education & outreach programs to promote the further development of solar energy in the U.S.
