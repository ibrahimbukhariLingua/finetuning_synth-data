Fares and ticketing on the Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)


# Fares and ticketing on the Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)



Rail operators are government-assisted profit-based corporations, fares and ticketing on Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system are aimed to break-even or exceed operating expenses. Rail operators collect fares based on account-based (ABT) and card-based ticketing options, the prices of which are calculated based on the distances travelled between the origin and destination. These prices increase in stages for standard non-concessionary travel, according to the distances travelled. In account-based ticketing, the fare is automatically calculated in the back-end and charged to the passenger post journey. On the other hand, card-based ticketing is proprietary to the transport network and the fare is computed by the system based on the store values recorded in the cards. The public transit system is harmonising towards full ABT.

Stations on the MRT system are divided into two areas, *paid* and *unpaid areas*, which allows the rail operators to collect needed fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as *access control gates*. These gates, connected to a computer network, are able to read the electronic tickets, and can store information such as the amount of time taken per trip, and the start and destination stations of each trip. This allows the rail operators to collect fares based on this information.


## Fares

Although operated by private companies, the system's fare structure is regulated by the Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. A fare review is conducted every year, based on a formula that itself is reviewed every 5 years. Since 2021, fare formula has been revised such that there is no Network Capacity Factor (NCF) involved, but the NCF for 2021 only has January 2020 data. The formula takes into account the main factors affecting the cost of operating the public transport system, including the MRT and public buses. Fare increases have caused public concern, but fares have been reduced in 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Historically, fares on the fully underground North East, Circle, and Downtown lines had been higher than those of the North–South and East–West lines (NSEWL), a disparity that was justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line. However, the Public Transport Council (PTC) announced in 2016 that fares for the three underground lines would be reduced to match those on the NSEWL, which took effect along with the annual fare review, on 30 December 2016.

After the opening of Downtown Line Stage 3, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced that public transport fare rules will be reviewed to allow for transfers across MRT lines at different stations due to the increasing density of the rail network. At the time, commuters were charged a second time when they made such transfers. He added that the PTC would review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate "fast, seamless" public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines was completed, and a waiver on the second boarding fee incurred when making such transfers was announced on 22 March 2018. The scheme was implemented on 29 December 2018.

Children under the age of 4 and below the height of 0.9m travels for free. Children under the age of 7 can travel for free using a child concession card.

After short-term concessionary travel expires, the following measures are being done:

* Primary school students and Secondary school students progressing to ITE will have the concessionary period extended for four more months upon completion of studies. Can continue to enjoy concessionary fares and purchase the next concession pass for four months.
* Secondary school students will have the concessionary period extended for the entire duration if going to junior college/pre-university. Those going to polytechnic or Higher NITEC from 1 January 2023 will continue to have concessionary fares extended for four more months until you pursue a full-time studies.
* ITE students from 1 January 2023 will continue to have concessionary fares extended for four more months until you pursue a full-time studies (e.g. Nitec to Higher Nitec, Higher Nitec to Work-Study Diploma or normal diploma).
* Graduating polytechnic students and A Level students after the expiry of concession will have to pay adult fares (and hence no concession fares for all university students), because male citizens are not allowed to defer to pursue degree courses and more than 90% of the undergraduates are eligible voters.

The only long-term concessionary travel is Passion Silver Card, Persons with Disabilities Card and Workfare Transport Concession Card.


## Ticketing


### Tickets

Fares can be paid via stored value travel cards (e.g. EZ-Link), bank cards (e.g. credit/debit cards, mobile wallets), or tourist passes. The ticketing system is developed based on the Contactless e-Purse Application (CEPAS) standard. The Symphony for e-payment (SeP) is the backend processing and clearing system for public transit. "SeP 2.0" allows smartcards, credit card and debit card that complies with the CEPAS standard to be used within the system and a wide variety of payment applications. "SeP 2.0" has permitted EZ-Link, NETS, Mastercard and VISA to provide for e-payment services.

The ticketing system currently utilises a mixture of Account-Based Ticketing (ABT), or SimplyGo, and legacy (non-ABT) card-based options. ABT has eliminated the need for top-ups.

Fares are charged based on commuters "tapping in" their payment cards, upon entering their mode of transport, at the origin or outset of the journey, and "tapping out" upon exit at the destination. The use of different cards during boarding and alighting, or the failure to tap out, will generally result in full or flat fare(s) charged to the user's account. Furthermore, fare evasion is subject to a penalty of S$50.

The current status of the ticketing methods for public transit are tabulated below:

#### Stored-value cards and SimplyGo

A non-concessionary stored value travel card from NETS or EZ-Link, may be purchased for S$10 (inclusive of a S$5 non-refundable card cost and a S$5 credit), for the payment of public transportation fares, from ticketing offices or merchant outlets where applicable. The EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay cards may also be used for the payment of goods and services at merchants displaying the "EZ-Link" logo, Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) tolls and Electronic Parking System (EPS) carparks. Commuters can elect to upgrade the legacy EZ-Link cards to SimplyGo, and once done, it is optional to download the EZ-Link or SimplyGo mobile applications to check on the card balance.

On 20 March 2017, LTA started a trial of the usage of contactless debit and credit MasterCard cards for fare payments on all main modes of public transport. Fares are charged directly to their debit or credit cards. From 3 December 2018, the trial was expanded to NETS and Visa cards. On 7 March 2019, the system was renamed to SimplyGo, and it was officially launched on 4 April 2019, starting with MasterCard holders. As of November 2019, Visa and NETS card holders are also able to utilise the system. And finally, all EZ-Link cardholders (including concession) can upgrade to SimplyGo. LTA and TransitLink is still in the works of adding concession fares into bank cards and smartwatches.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 9 January 2024, LTA announced that NETS FlashPay cards, EZ-Link cards and charms that have not been upgraded to SimplyGo can no longer be used for public transport from 1 June 2024. Charms are special EZ-Link cards in the form of trinkets. Only SimplyGo payment options will be accepted at MRT/LRT fare gates and bus card readers, while the aforementioned options may still be used for motoring needs. Due to public backlash, the authorities announced on 22 January 2024 that the decision was reversed and the LTA was tasked to look into improving the user experience for ABT cards and solutions to display the fare and cards balances at fare gates and bus card readers.

In moves to improve standardisation across platforms, the TransitLink and EZ-Link entities will be merged into one company SimplyGo, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Land Transport Authority in August 2024. In addition, the EZ-Link and SimplyGo applications will be integrated into a common application called SimplyGo.


#### Singapore Tourist Pass

A Singapore Tourist Pass may be purchased from S$22 (inclusive of a S$10 refundable card deposit and a 3-day pass) for the payment of public transportation fares. The card may be purchased at selected TransitLink Ticket Offices, LTA Kiosks, Passenger Service Centres and Singapore Visitors Centres, and can be refunded at both TransitLink Ticket Offices and Passenger Service Centres.


### Access-control gates

Access-control gates found in Singapore's MRT and LRT stations have evolved in design & features over the years. A few different series of gates from different manufacturers have been used in MRT and LRT stations. The two oldest generations of these gates in the MRT stations began to be removed starting from March 2010, and this was completed by October 2014.

On 22 July 2018, a hands-free ticketing technology trial was launched at 4 stations to examine the feasibility of a new hands-free fare gate that allows people with disabilities to enter and exit MRT stations without tapping their fare cards. If found to be feasible, the fare gates may be introduced to more stations. The trial lasted until November 2018. A tender for a second trial was announced in February 2020, with the possibility of expanding the system to all public buses and 400 faregates should the trial be successful.

#### Replacement of all ticketing machines into Top-Up Kiosk (TUK)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Add Value Machine (AVM), Top-Up Machine (TUM) and General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) were however replaced by Top-Up Kiosk (TUK). These replacement programme are as follows:

* 23 January 2020 - 15 January 2021: Circle Line and Thomson–East Coast Line
* 19 April 2021 - 19 July 2021: North–South Line
