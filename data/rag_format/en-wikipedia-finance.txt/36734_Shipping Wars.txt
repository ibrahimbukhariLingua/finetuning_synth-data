Shipping Wars


# Shipping Wars



***Shipping Wars*** is an American reality television series that aired on A&E from January 10, 2012, to April 29, 2015. Season 9 premiered on November 30, 2021, with a new cast of shippers. The show follows various independent shippers who have discovered that money can be made transporting large/bulky/unusual items that traditional carriers either cannot or will not haul. They compete for shipments in timed auctions held by uShip, one of the largest online auction houses for independent shippers.


## Overview

In seasons 1–8, the shippers place bids on two shipments listed on uShip, in a reverse auction format. Bids are generally made with comments about the likely costs and risks, as well as the motives and abilities. When the time limit for an auction runs out, the job is typically awarded to the lowest bidder; at the client's discretion, however, it may be awarded to a higher bidder with a better average feedback rating from past clients. Feedback ratings are used to break any ties for the lowest bid. In season 9, the shippers receive their loads from a shipping broker, and the bidding process is not shown.

Winners load their cargo and attempt to deliver it intact by the client's or receiver's deadline. Feedback ratings from clients appear after the loads have been delivered. At the end of the episode, each shipper's revenue is tallied on-screen, with the expenses (fuel, labor, late-delivery penalties, fines, etc.) subtracted from the bid amount to determine the overall profit or loss. At times, a shipper will arrange to haul one or more additional loads on the same trip, with the extra money figured into their tally. In some cases, the shipper will be unable to complete a job due to concerns over load size/weight or road safety. On occasion, one shipper will enlist the services of another to help complete a job; the shippers then decide between themselves how to split the proceeds. In seasons 1–8, the progress of each shipment is interspersed with humorous criticisms from the other shippers.

## Reception

David Wiegand of the *San Francisco Chronicle* says the show is "well made and fun to watch". David Knowles of *The Hollywood Reporter* states, "Though the fast paced editing scheme manages to keep the point and click bidding from feeling as droll as Internet auctions are in real life, the relentlessly quick hits of dialog and action make the proceedings feel like a teaser rather than the actual program". Monica Hesse of *The Washington Post* states, "*Shipping Wars* is mostly about the perfectly packed trunk and the ecstasy of having not an inch to spare".
