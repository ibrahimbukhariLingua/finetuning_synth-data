Insight Labs


# Insight Labs



The **Insight Labs** is a pro bono strategy development platform for non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations and government agencies.


## Methodology and format

An Insight Lab is a structured, three-hour strategy session for a non-profit organization, government agency or industry. Participants are corporate leaders from varied industries, representatives from the benefiting entities, "wildcard" participants (such as professional writers, artists, or scientists), and The Insight Labs staff who moderate the discussion.

The Insight Labs staff choose participants from the creative, corporate and academic world for their strategic and creative thinking. These individuals are able to lend these skills to the issue addressed at the Lab without concern for the current limitations of the partner organization. The Insight Lab Founder and Dean Jeff Leitner argues that including intelligent individuals who are not impacted directly by the outcome of the session allows for more creative solutions.


## Background

The prototype for Insight Labs was developed in summer 2006. In spring 2008, the format was refocused on philanthropic efforts. Jeff Leitner and co-founder and director, Howell J. Malham Jr., developed the current format in spring 2009.

Jeff Leitner is founder and dean of Insight Labs. He holds degrees in Government from University of Texas and in Journalism from Ohio State University, and prior to co-founding Insight Labs worked as a reporter, a political campaign strategist, and public affairs strategist.

Howell J. Malham Jr. is co-founder and director of publishing and media for Insight Labs. He was a founding partner of the new media agency DIGITAAL and has written for The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. He holds a degree from Arizona State University. He is the author of a book, *I Have a Strategy (No, You Don't)*, published 5 February 2013 by Jossey-Bass publishers.

As of February 2013, over 45 strategy sessions or conferences have occurred, including more than 500 participants.

### 2009

In 2009, the Labs conducted their first two sessions in their current format, the first with One D, a confederation of Detroit non-profits, to address the gap between local jobs programs and corporate HR interests. Among the conclusions were ""Detroit has a rich, exploitable asset: thousands of men and women who grew up in Detroit and might very well return. Proof: HR professionals say their best odds of hiring out-of-towners come when they report Detroit expatriates." The second lab of the year was held in partnership with Executive Breakfast Club, with a goal of developing ideas to make the topic of business ethics affirmative and appealing, rather than a focus on "what not to do".
