## History

Capillary Technologies was founded in August 2008 by Aneesh Reddy, Krishna Mehra, and Ajay Modani and initially headquartered in Bangalore, India. Reddy, Mehra, and Modani were each alumnus at ITC Limited, Microsoft Research, and Danieli, respectively.

In 2013, Capillary Technologies was used as a case study for "reverse innovation" published in Harvard Business Review.

In December 2016, Rajan Anandan, who at the time was Google's Vice President for Southeast Asia and India, joined Capillary's Board of Directors.

Co-founder Aneesh Reddy operated as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Capillary Technologies until 2022. In September 2022, Capillary Technologies announced that Sameer Garde would take over as the company's CEO and Reddy would transition to managing director. Garde resigned as CEO in March 2024 "due to personal reasons," and Reddy returned to the company's role as CEO.


### Expansion

Capillary Technologies operated primarily in India and in new or emerging markets in less-developed countries. In 2011, Capillary began looking toward established markets in more developed nations.


#### International growth

The company began expanding operations into China in July 2016 and, in September 2019, Capillary partnered with Veda Holding, a Saudi investment holding company, to expand to Saudi Arabia. To operate in the country, Capillary formed a Saudi-specific entity called *Capillary Arabia*.
