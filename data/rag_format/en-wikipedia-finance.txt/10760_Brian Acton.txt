# Brian Acton



**Brian Acton** (born February 17, 1972) is an American business executive and computer programmer serving as the executive chairperson of Signal Technology Foundation, which he co-founded with Moxie Marlinspike in 2018. Acton also serves as interim chief executive officer (CEO) of Signal Messenger LLC.

He was formerly employed at Yahoo!. In 2009, Jan Koum and Acton co-founded WhatsApp, a mobile messaging application which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for US$19 billion. Acton left WhatsApp in September 2017 to start the Signal Foundation. According to *Forbes* (2020), Acton is the 836th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $2.5 billion.


## Early life and education

Acton grew up in Michigan, later moving to Central Florida, where he graduated from Lake Howell High School. Acton received a full scholarship to study engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, but left after a year to study at Stanford. He graduated from Stanford University in 1994 with a degree in computer science.


## Career

In 1992, Acton became a systems administrator for Rockwell International, before becoming a product tester at Apple Inc. and Adobe Systems. In 1996, he joined Yahoo Inc.


### Yahoo!

Two years after Acton joined Yahoo, Jan Koum was hired as an infrastructure engineer shortly after he met Acton while working at Ernst & Young as a security tester. Over the next nine years, the two worked together at Yahoo. Acton lost millions in the dot-com bubble of 2000. In September 2007, Koum and Acton left Yahoo! and took a year off, traveling around South America. They both tried to get jobs at Facebook, but weren't hired.


### WhatsApp

In January 2009, Koum bought an iPhone and realized that the then seven-month-old App Store was about to spawn a whole new industry of apps. He visited his friend Alex Fishman and talked about developing an app. Koum almost immediately chose the name WhatsApp because it sounded like "what's up", and a week later on his birthday, Feb. 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California.

In 2014, Koum and Acton sold WhatsApp to Facebook for approximately US$19 billion in cash and stock. *Forbes* estimated that Acton held over 20% stake in the company, making his net worth around $3.8 billion.

In 2016, Acton led a funding round for Trak N Tell and raised $3.5 million along with two other investors.

In September 2017, Acton left WhatsApp. Acton told *Forbes* that he left over a dispute with Facebook regarding monetization of WhatsApp, and voluntarily left $850 million in unvested options on the table by leaving a few months before vesting was completed. He also said that he was coached by Facebook executives to mislead European regulators regarding Facebook's intention to merge Facebook and WhatsApp user data.


### Signal

Acton left WhatsApp in September 2017 to start a new foundation, the Signal Foundation, which is dedicated to helping people have access to private communication through an encrypted messaging app. Signal is widely used by journalists and human rights activists.

In February 2018, it was announced that Acton was investing $50 million into Signal. This funding was a loan from Acton to the new non-profit Signal Technology Foundation. By the end of 2018, the loan had increased to $105,000,400, due to be repaid on February 28, 2068. The loan is unsecured and carries nil interest.

On March 20, 2018, *Forbes* reported that Acton had publicly tweeted support for the #DeleteFacebook movement, in a "new level of public backlash". In November 2019, the journalist Steven Levy asked Acton why he decided to make his feelings so public. Acton said he felt that it was time because there was pressure unfolding against Facebook.

Acton is currently a board member of the Signal Foundation.

It granted $6.4 million in 2015, $19.2 million in 2016, and $23.6 million in 2017.
