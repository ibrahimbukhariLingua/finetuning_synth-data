Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura


# Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura



The **Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura** or **BNA**, was an Italian bank that existed from 1921 to 2000.


## History

Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura was established in Milan in 1921 by Count Giovanni ArmeniseÂ [it] (who after his death was succeeded by his nephew Giovanni Auletta Armenise, president of the bank until 1995); in 1938 its headquarters were moved to Rome and it was authorised to operate in the field of agrarian credit for both operating and improvement purposes.

The Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura is linked to the Piazza Fontana bombing, a terrorist attack that took place in a branch of the bank in the centre of Milan: a bomb exploded there on 12 December 1969 at 16:37, killing seventeen people (fourteen immediately) and wounding eighty-eight others.

In 2000, the bank was merged into Banca Antoniana Popolare Veneta, later Banca Antonveneta, which in turn initially merged into ABN AMRO, before then merging into the Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
