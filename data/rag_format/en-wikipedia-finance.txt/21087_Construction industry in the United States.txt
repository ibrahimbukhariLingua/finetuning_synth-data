Construction industry in the United States


# Construction industry in the United States



The **construction industry in the United States** is one of the major sectors of the country's economy. As of November 1, 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ there are over 745,000 general contractor LLCs employing over 7.6 million in its workforce, putting up almost US$1.4 trillion worth of structures annually.


## Regulation

The American construction industry suffers from fragmentation along state lines because of how professional licensing has traditionally been the province of the state governments. Thus, construction professionals based on one state who wish to practice in other states must comply with those states' various licensing, registration, taxation, and incorporation requirements. A 1998 treatise on the law of American construction professional licensing required 1,842 pages split across two volumes to summarize the requirements for fifty states, the District of Columbia, and contractors working for the federal government.


## Workforce

In 2006 unauthorized immigrants comprised 12% of the workforce.


## Pest treatment

Termites are a constant threat here, as they are in much of the world. New construction here often requires pre- or post- treatment or both.
