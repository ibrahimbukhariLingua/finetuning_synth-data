## Overview

This book is a business novella using magic as a metaphor to change the readersâ€™ behavior and empower the reader to think out of the box. The author believes that
Innovation begins by challenging assumptions. The term, Follow the Other Hand, is derived from a sleight of hand magic trick that reminds people that what they assume to be true is actually a belief. And if they follow that belief they will be misdirected such as in magic. But if they challenge the assumption; in essence, follow the other hand, they will find the secret or a new business solution that did not exist before. The book uses lessons instead of chapters. Each lesson ends with instructions for a magic trick supporting the premise of that lesson.
