## The SAF2002 bankruptcy prediction model

In 2003, Dr. Shirata introduced the SAF2002 bankruptcy prediction model. The acronym SAF stands for Simple Analysis of Failure. The SAF2002 model was developed by analyzing the financial data of 1,436 bankrupt companies and 3,434 non-bankrupt companies extracted by a systematic sampling method from 107,034 companies. The variables for the model were selected by using a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) type of decision tree learning approach to analyze the financial data of Japanese companies that entered bankruptcy between 1992 and 2001. The four variables of the model that the CART approach identified are:

{\displaystyle (x\_{1})} Retained Earnings to Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity,
{\displaystyle (x\_{2})} Net Income Before Tax to Total Liabilities and Owners’ Equity,
{\displaystyle (x\_{3})} Inventory Turnover Period, and
{\displaystyle (x\_{4})} Interest Expenses to Sales.

Based on a linear model, which exhibited the most stable and discriminant results, the model's SAF value for each firm is based on the following equation:

A SAF value of 0.7 or below quickly raises a firm's bankruptcy risk.
