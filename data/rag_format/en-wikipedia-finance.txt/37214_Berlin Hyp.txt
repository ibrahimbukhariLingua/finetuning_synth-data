Berlin Hyp


# Berlin Hyp



The **Berlin Hyp AG**, based in Berlin, is one of the large German real estate and mortgage banks. The bank was created in 1996 from the merger of *Berliner Hypotheken- und Pfandbriefbank AG* and *Braunschweig-Hannoversche Hypothekenbank AG*.

The Berlin Hyp focuses its sales activities on business with investors, housing companies, real estate funds, investment companies and selected developers. Regionally, it concentrates on economically strong metropolitan areas in Germany and various foreign markets in Europe.


## History

The Berlin Hyp's first predecessor institute, the *Berliner Pfandbriefinstitut*, was founded in 1868. Later, the institute operated under the name of *Berliner Pfandbriefamt*. In 1973, a number of public institutions were incorporated under the name *Berliner Pfandbrief-Bank* as a public-law institution:

* *Stadtschaft der Mark Brandenburg*
* *Berliner Hypothekenbankverein* (*Stadtschaft*)
* *Preußische Zentralstadtschaft*
* *Brandenburgische Provinzialbank und Girozentrale*
* *Brandenburgischer Sparkassen- und Giroverband*
* *Kur- und Neumärkische Ritterschaftliche Darlehens-Kasse*, *Märkische Landschaft*, Preussische Staatsbank [sv]

In 1993, the legal form was changed to a Joint-stock company. Since this change, the bank has been operating as *Berliner Hypotheken- und Pfandbriefbank AG* (short: Berlin Hyp). The sole shareholder was the state of Berlin. In 1994, a predecessor institution of today's *Landesbank Berlin* took over all shares. The current bank was created in 1996 from the merger of *Berliner Hypotheken- und Pfandbriefbank AG* and *Braunschweig-Hannoversche Hypothekenbank AG*.

In November 2009, the Berlin Hyp's Supervisory Board resolved a substantial capital increase by issuing new no-par-value shares in order to broaden the scope of action for new business acquisitions and thereby expand and consolidate its market position.

In October 2013, the company was renamed Berlin Hyp AG. Also, the brand image of the bank was completely revised and has since leaned its business colors and appearance against the image of the *Sparkasse*, to make the involvement of the Berlin Hyp in the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe outwardly visible.

As of January 1, 2015, the company's shares were transferred to LBB Holding and the commercial real estate financing business, which had previously been operated jointly with *Landesbank Berlin*, was dissolved.

The Berlin Hyp is a member of the *Verband deutscher Pfandbriefbanken*.

## Brand and corporate design

At the beginning of 2013, the traditional *Berliner Immobilienbank* was facing a comprehensive strategic repositioning. The starting point for the rebranding was the organizational reorganization of the parent company, *Landesbank Berlin* (LBB). Berlin Hyp was set up as an independent real estate financier and future subsidiary of *Berliner Sparkasse* within the *Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe*. Factors of the reorientation were the now independent market position and the expansion of the range of services as a composite bank in the *Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe* and for real estate clients.

The slogan of the Berlin Hyp is "partnership is our foundation". The slogan represents a promise of service to its employees, customers, partners and owners. It guides the operation and emphasizes key features of the Berlin Hyp: down-to-earth, reliable, in partnership and personal.
