## History


### Pre FHRI

Established in 1989 to oversee the restoration of the historic Raffles Hotel in Singapore and the restructuring of Raffles City, the Raffles hotel company reopened its flagship hotel on September 16, 1991.

The company purchased the Swiss么tel chain in 2001, and it took over the then Westin Stamford and Westin Plaza (both in Singapore) as the contract expired at the end of the year. On January 1, 2002, the two hotels were renamed as Swiss么tel The Stamford and Raffles The Plaza (now Fairmont Singapore) respectively, with a refurbished look.

Former owner Raffles Holdings announced the sale of the chain on July 18, 2005, to Colony Capital from October 1, 2005. The sale included its 41 hotels and resorts, and its hotels under development. This included the landmark Raffles Hotel in Singapore, which is on a 100-year lease to Colony Capital. However, Raffles City was owned by Raffles Holdings under Tincel Properties Pte Ltd when it was sold, but it was eventually sold to CapitaCommercial Trust and CapitaMall Trust in July 2006.

Fairmont Hotels and Resorts originated from two hotel businesses established in the late 19th century, the Canadian Pacific Limited-owned Canadian Pacific Hotels & Resorts, and Fairmont Hotels. In 1999, Canadian Pacific Hotels acquired a majority interest in Fairmont Hotels; with Canadian Pacific Hotels later renaming its entire hotel portfolio under the Fairmont Hotels & Resorts banner in 2001. Shortly after the hotel division was renamed, Canadian Pacific Limited was split into several smaller companies in a starburst move, with Fairmont becoming a separately-traded company.


### As FRHI

FRHI was formed in January 2006, when Fairmont Hotels and Resorts was acquired by Colony Capital, who subsequently entered into a joint venture with the Kingdom Holding Company; consolidating Fairmont with their other hotel brands, Raffles and Swiss么tel to form Fairmont Raffles Hotels International (FRHI).

The company also owned Delta Hotels at one point, but it sold that hotel management company in October 2007 to bcIMC, a Crown corporation owned by the Government of British Columbia. In 2015, Delta Hotels was purchased by Marriott International.

Voyager Partners, a Qatari Diar affiliate, subsequently acquired a majority interest in FRHI in April 2010. In December 2015, AccorHotels announced that it would be purchasing FRHI in a US$2.9 billion deal, which was completed in 2016.
