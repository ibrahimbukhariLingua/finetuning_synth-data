Rex Airlines


# Rex Airlines



**Rex Airlines Pty Ltd** is an Australian regional airline based in Mascot, New South Wales. It operates scheduled regional services using turboprop aircraft. Between 2021 and 2024, Rex also operated jet services between selected major Australian cities. In July 2024, it collapsed and was placed into voluntary administration.

It is the primary subsidiary of **Regional Express Holdings**, itself predominantly foreign-owned by Singaporean businessman Lim Kim Hai and Hong Kong investment firm PAG. Rex is Australia's second-largest regional airline by number of regional destinations, serving 45 regional destinations, behind QantasLink, who serve 55 regional destinations across Australia.

On the night of 30 July 2024, the airline ceased all bookings for domestic jet service routes to capital cities and fell into voluntary administration, appointing joint administrators from Ernst & Young. It came one day after Rex stopped trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), amid fears the airline could halt all operations. Rex continues to operate some regional services, which are being funded by PAG Asia and Queensland governmentᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, despite its administration.

In September 2024, two months after the commencement of the administration, it was revealed that no buyer is currently found, with fears for the company to be collapsing or broken up. It did, however, previously get an extension from the Federal Court of Australia to further facilitate the sale process.

In November 2024, the company got another extension of the administration and received funding from the government to keep afloat. It also had previously started stripping a few subsidiaries, such as Pel-Air to Toll Group.

The company is currently in the midst of a lawsuit by the corporate watchdog over misleading and deceptive conduct of its ex-directors, alleging the members mislead the market on its financial position during FY22.

However, in January 2025, the federal government bought $50 million debt from the senior lender PAG in another effort to secure the future of the airline, and supported administrators in again finding a buyer.

As another reversal in the government's negotiations with the airline, the government pledged to buy the airline if no buyer is found.


## History

The airline was established in 2002 when the Australiawide Airlines consortium (set up by former Ansett Australia employees) acquired Hazelton Airlines and Kendell Airlines, before merging the companies and starting operations as **Rex** in August 2002. In 2005, Australiawide Airlines was renamed Regional Express Holdings and partially floated on the Australian Securities Exchange. On 30 November 2005, Rex announced the acquisition of the Dubbo-based Air Link, another regional airline.

In October 2007, Rex expanded into Queensland when it commenced operations between Brisbane and Maryborough. This exacerbated an existing problem within the company of not having enough pilots to crew its flights (due to the expansion of larger airlines, especially Jetstar and Virgin Blue), and Rex suspended operations out of Brisbane (and from Sydney to Cooma during the summer "low season" for this route to the NSW ski fields) in November 2007. To provide a medium-term solution to the pilot shortage, Rex announced that it was establishing a cadet-pilot flight-training programme.

In November 2015, Rex announced the resumption of services to the NSW Snowy Mountains in conjunction with Snowy Mountains Airport Corporation, with the flights resuming in March 2016. In December 2015, Rex announced that it would be commencing operations in Western Australia in February the following year after being selected by the Government of Western Australia to be the operator of regulated RPT routes after a tender process. Initially operating from Perth to Albany and Esperance, in July 2018 the Western Australian operations expanded to include Carnarvon and Monkey Mia. It brought Rex's weekly flights to roughly 1,500 across 60 destinations.

Starting on 6 April 2020, Rex significantly scaled back all its regional services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing to only offer government-subsidised services within Queensland and Western Australia and one flight a week between all 54 regional and remote communities within its route network. Services including Adelaide to Port Augusta, Sydney to Newcastle and Sydney to Armidale were suspended.

In June 2020, eyeing the demise of Tigerair Australia, Rex announced interest in expanding into the domestic airline market between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Rex leased six Boeing 737-800s previously leased by Virgin Australia to operate the new services, with the first delivered in November 2020. The first jet operations began on 1 March 2021 on the Melbourne to Sydney route. Also in June 2020, Rex announced that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding with ATR to explore options for replacing the Saab 340 fleet with ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft. Following the airline's launch of jet services in March 2021, Rex replaced the announced Brisbane jet services in early April with services to Adelaide and Gold Coast, with the start of services occurring between 29 March and 1 April. The airline later cancelled all 737 fights and went into administration.



## Regional Express Holdings

**Regional Express Holdings** **Limited** is the parent company of a number of airline and associated companies in Australia. It is based in Mascot, New South Wales (a suburb of Sydney) and is a public listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange. Regional Express Holdings arose from the 2001 collapse of Ansett Airlines, which was the parent company of Kendell Airlines and Hazelton Airlines. A group of Singaporean investors and a collection of Australian private investors purchased the Hazelton and Kendell businesses, which were profitable entities before they were taken over by Ansett. The investors formed **Australiawide Airlines**, which was officially incorporated on 12 February 2002. The assets of the two airlines were purchased by Australiawide and merged to form the airline Regional Express, known as Rex. In 2005 Australiawide offered a percentage of the owners' shares (35 million out of 115 million shares, or 30.43%) to the public in a float. At the same time an agreement was reached with the owners of Pel-Air that Australiawide would purchase Pel-Air.

As part of the public float process, Australiawide Airlines' name was changed to **Regional Express Holdings**. Regional Express Holdings is the owner of a number of other companies. The main asset is **Regional Express Pty Ltd.** which is the company that operates the business of the airline Regional Express (Rex) and owns Rex Airlines Pty Limited. Rex Airlines Pty Limited was registered on the 6 July 2020 as part of Rex domestic expansion plans, responsible for issuing tickets on behalf of Regional Express Pty Limited. Another company is **Air Partners Pty. Ltd.**, which is the company that owns National Jet Express and Pel-Air and Rex Flyer. The third subsidiary company is **Rex Investment Holdings Pty. Ltd.**, which owns the Australian Aero Propeller Maintenance and Australian Airline Pilot Academies based in Wagga Wagga and Ballarat.


### 2024 voluntary administration

In July 2024, the company requested a trading halt. This sparked comparisons with Bonza, that had collapsed and later was wound up earlier that year, and calls by the Transport Workers' Union of Australia for government intervention, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese asking for time and conditions and criticising the company's move away from regional service. It later suspended ticket sales with plans to exit out of the capital city market and appointed EY as administrators. Capital city flights were suspended, with an agreement reached with Virgin Australia to accommodate affected Rex customers between 30 July and 14 August 2024. On 31 July, the company was placed into voluntary administration and cancelled all capital cities flights, but continued to operate regional services. PAG has held off taking the company under receivership, with the hope that the company will be sold instead. The leases on three of its Boeing 737s were taken over by Virgin Australia.

In August, the federal government guaranteed flights with Rex or moneyback. Administrators thanked the move as added certainty for customers during the process. However, there has been no specific dollar metric set until the event of cancellation, or say on whether further intervention might be needed to support the business or find a buyer including an outright bailout. This has also drawn slight criticism from unions and the federal opposition, calling it a "stopgap measure" and calling to go further as stated, including guaranteeing staff on the Fair Entitlements Guarantee - a system that was put off in the case of Bonza -, with fears also for keeping remote communities connected to transit and essential services. Meanwhile, after an extended investigation into the source of a $500 million debt or possible insolvent trading, the administrators blamed a series of factors principally a pilot shortage and other supply chain issues, ex-staff entitlements and half-empty seats for the collapse. The company is indebted to a total of 4,800 creditors including ex-staff, airports and funders.
It is estimated that the administration of Rex has resulted in about 600 job losses within the company and counting, with the assurance that business is not affected and that the staff are not being stripped right down but in fact were returned to original levels.

On 23 August, the company was granted an extension of the administration by the Federal Court of Australia to 25 November, allowing more time to process and bind expressions of interest but does not intend to use all of it to find a buyer. It was later revealed that there are reports of no real interest in buying the company and that the holding company may be either broken up and sold, placed into liquidation, and/or moved on to receivership. On 8 October, it was revealed a YouGov poll suggested high popular demand for further government intervention such as part-nationalisation of the company and setting up a separate industry commission, such as a "Safe & Secure Skies Commission", to reduce fierce monopoly and fair work and consumer affairs violations plaguing the industry.

In October 2024, Pel-Air was sold to the Toll Group. Wagga Wagga flight school, Australian Airline Pilot Academy was also put up for sale for $17 million.

In November 2024 its administration was extended again to 30 June, with the government finally also in talks of giving the company $80 million and early access to the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. This move has angered rivals, who called out the government and administrators for not allowing for any discourse whatsoever and not looking into the greater competition or situation.

Administrators have found themselves in two lawsuits, including one by ASIC alleging the company mislead investors on its financial trend before the collapse.

On 23 January 2025, the federal government announced it would acquire the $50 million in debt from the senior lender PAG in another effort to secure the future of the airline, becoming the new major creditor for the company and, as a creditor, filing to be a voting member in the administration's Committee of Inspection. The Government is reported to be 'supporting' the company in finding a buyer, after the first effort did not find a buyer. While getting bipartisan support from the Opposition, the announcement is made out by the government and analysts as a move to support regional areas in the near next election.

On 12 February 2025, the federal government announced it would buy the airline if no buyer was found, coinciding with support of prospective buyers for the company. It has clarified it is not particularly in the list of buyers for the company, calling on the private sector to see an outcome for the company first. It will be the first nationally-owned airline since the privatisation of Qantas in 1997. This saw optimism from the TMU, but however, this escalation has sparked some opposition from the Coalition and conservative outlets, pointing out at question time that the taxpayer shouldn't foot the bill to keep the airline afloat, that rivals should have a say in the process which they currently don't, and cynical connections to Albanese himself and if he will appoint disgraced Qantas CEO Allan Joyce, while the Government rebutted with airlines collapsing under their watch and the close connections to the board of the airline who had grandiose plans which ultimately ran the airline to the ground. This has also sparked some opposition from rivals, with the founder of Nexus Airlines Michael McConachy commenting that the sale campaign itself was poor and staggered and a collapse would not affect competition as others can step in and the actually-monopolised routes are few and state-underwritten.


## Controversies


### Political links criticism

Rex has been criticised for its close political and financial relationship with the Coalition, particularly the centre-right to right-wing National Party of Australia. John Sharp, Rex's current deputy chairman, was a National Party member of the Australian Parliament from 1984 to 1998.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Rex has provided National Party members with flight tickets free of charge during election campaigns, and is a major donor to the political party.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, it was revealed that Rex received more taxpayer funds than Qantas and Virgin Australia combined, despite the Australian flag-carrier being more than six times larger than Rex by number of aircraft and employees.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In response to this revelation, the then-Labor opposition accused the then-Coalition Government of "supporting their National Party mates", a reference to the close friendship between John Sharp and then-deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Michael McCormack, who authorised the handout.

In 2022, the year the Coalition lost government federally, Rex named a newly delivered 737-800 aircraft after McCormack at the airline's 20th anniversary celebrations.


### Hostilities with Australian regional councils

Since its inception, Rex has been involved in tense public disputes with many regional councils in Australia, whom operate many regional airports, over airport fees, high airfares and alleged price gouging, airport security costs, operational requirements as well as negative comments about the airline made by regional mayors and councillors, and have made various threats with the intention of pressuring councils to the point where they succumb to satisfying the company's demands. Threats made by Rex, which in many cases have been followed through, have included temporary or permanent suspension of flights to relevant cities and towns, alleged acts of blackmailing councils, and banning councillors from flying with the airline. In some cases Rex has directly withdrawn flights to towns in response, without engaging with affected councils. In some cases, Rex's withdrawal of services has left many towns across Australia without an air service.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Arizona aircraft theft

In September 2024, it was revealed that USA-based firm Jet Midwest Group filed a US$7,200,000 (AU$10,737,760) lawsuit alleging Rex unlawfully dismantled parts and scrapped 4 SAAB 340 aircraft in the firm's possession when they were stored at an aircraft boneyard in Kingman Airport, Arizona. The lawsuit, filed by the firm in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, alleges Rex instructed a third party to remove these parts, which included engines and propellers, as well as to scrap the airframes, and profited from the sale of these components.

The litigant was soon deterred from proceeding by the court, which agreed with the administrators citing that it would be a huge "costly" logistical distraction from the company which will affect the efficacy of the administration. Jet Midwest backed out agreeing that there is no "urgency" in the claim seeing it even took 4 years to take action.


### ASIC lawsuit

In December 2024, following an investigation regarding an ASX tipoff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission began legal proceedings against four former directors of the company over allegations of deceptive and misleading conduct and dereliction of directorial duty regarding accurately and timely reporting the company's financial performance to the market leading up to its collapse. The regulator alleges it was making baseless, disingenuous claims to investors regarding its financial position which also contradicted a massive $35 million profit downgrade forecast. The regulator clarified it is not looking to personally fine the company (especially "given its current circumstances") or claim outright insolvent trading, but leave it to the Supreme Court of New South Wales to declare contravention first which then may result in fines or bans targeted at the offenders themselves.

ASIC later alleged that Rex told investors it shall receive a full-year profit, whilst reeling from a EBT $7 million loss in February 2023 following a $109 million loss in 2022 and seeking $10 million funding citing its cash reserves being "critically low" and "disappointingly and bewilderingly" terrible sales. The airline would ultimately still go on to make a $32 million loss that year in total.


## Destinations

Rex Airlines initially offered regional flights from various bases across Australia using turboprop aircraft, but in March 2021 began flying between its bases using jet aircraft with flights between Melbourne and Sydney. Prior to its voluntary administration in July 2024, its domestic flights were between Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Gold Coast, Adelaide and Hobart.

### Fleet development

Rex operates the world's largest fleet of Saab 340 aircraft. The delivery of 25 ex-American Eagle Airlines Saab 340B *Plus* aircraft started in mid-2007 and enabled the expansion of services and the phase-out of the airline's Saab 340As, and some older B models. The 340B *Plus* has a quieter and more comfortable interior.

In July 2008 the company announced that all of its 340As would be phased out; however one rejoined the fleet in July 2015 after a 7-year stint with Rex's subsidiary airline Pel-Air and remains in service as of January 2020.

The airline also previously operated some Fairchild Metro 23 aircraft seating 19 passengers, but the aircraft were later phased out.

The airline operated an all-Saab 340 fleet with three variants of the type until December of 2020, when the airline commenced jet aircraft operations following the delivery of its first Boeing 737-800.


## Incidents and accidents

* On 21 February 2016, a Regional Express Airlines Saab 340B, registered VH-ZLA, was forced to take evasive action to avoid a glider while operating from Orange Airport. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) found the Rex aircraft was climbing through 7,500 ft after departing Orange when the crew sighted the glider in "close proximity", and took evasive action.
* On 17 March 2017, the right propeller sheared off a Regional Express Saab 340B, registered VH-NRX, while operating flight ZL768 from Albury to Sydney. The pilot made a pan-pan call but was able to land the plane without incident. The ATSB after investigating found a fatigue crack in the engine's propeller mounting flange.
* 23 March 2017, at about 0942 Eastern Daylight-saving Time, a Regional Express SAAB 340B, registered VH-RXS, departed Dubbo Airport, New South Wales to operate scheduled passenger flight ZL821 to Sydney, New South Wales. At about 0944, as the aircraft climbed through about 4,300 ft, the flight crew heard several bangs from the right engine accompanied by jolts through the aircraft.
* On 29 August 2019, a Regional Express Saab 340B, registration VH-RXX, the crew received a right engine fire indication followed by a loud bang while they were shutting the engine down. The aircraft landed at the planned destination of Merimbula without further incident. The ATSB discovered that the indication and subsequent engine failure was caused by an internal oil fire weakening the turbine blades.
* On 8 May 2019, Regional Express Saab 340B aircraft, registered VH-OLM, descent below minimum safe altitude, 15 km south-west of Williamtown Aerodrome (Newcastle Airport), New South Wales. The ATSB found the flight crew had misjudged the aircraft's position relative to the aerodrome while conducting a night visual approach.
* On 20 August 2019 a Regional Express, Saab Aircraft Company 340B, registration VH-ZLX, departed Adelaide, for a regular public transport flight to Port Lincoln, South Australia. During the post flight walk around, the first officer noted that the left main outboard landing gear tyre was deflated and that a piece of the wheel was missing. Ground support personnel at Adelaide Airport subsequently located the missing section of wheel on the runway strip. An area of fatigue cracking in the wheel. It was considered likely that the fatigue crack was present at the most recent maintenance visit, however, it had not been detected.
* 6 July 2021, a Saab 340B aircraft, registered VH-ZLJ, departed Perth Airport for a scheduled passenger flight to Albany, Western Australia. At about 1623, while climbing through an altitude of 6,000 ft, and before entering icing conditions, the crew activated the engine anti-ice and wing de-ice systems. Shortly afterwards, caution lights illuminated indicating a fault in the de-ice system. After levelling off at 7,000 ft, the crew actioned the relevant abnormal checklist, but the caution lights remained on. In response, the flight crew requested a descent to 5,000 ft to exit icing conditions and decided to return to Perth. ATC instructed the crew to make a right turn. About 20 seconds after beginning the turn, the aircraft’s aerodynamic stall warning stick shakers activated. The first officer initiated the stall recovery procedure before the captain took control as pilot flying to complete the recovery. The aircraft returned to Perth, landing at 1642.
* 5 April 2022, a Regional Express SAAB 340B aircraft, registered VH-ZRK, was being prepared for an air transport flight from Melbourne, Victoria to King Island, Tasmania. The scheduled departure time was 1445 local time. Interrupted engine start and evacuation. Two passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation.
* 4 November 2022, rejected take-off involving SAAB 340, VH-ZRC, at Flinders Island Airport, Tasmania. During the take-off roll, the aircraft veered to the left and the crew detected abnormal airspeed indications before rejecting the take-off, resulting in four landing gear tyres deflating.
* 21 December 2022, SAAB 340B aircraft, registered VH-RXE, that occurred about 140 km from Perth, Western Australia. During cruise, the no. 2 engine failed, and the crew returned the aircraft to Perth.

## Flight school

In November 2007, Regional Express Airlines and Mangalore Airport Pty Limited created a joint venture pilot academy called the Civil Aviation Training Academy, based at Mangalore Airport in Victoria. In April 2008, Regional Express Airlines fully acquired the Civil Aviation Training Academy and it was renamed to Australian Airline Pilot Academy.

On 18 February 2009, Regional Express Airlines announced that the Australian Airline Pilot Academy (AAPA) would be relocated from Mangalore Airport to Wagga Wagga Airport in partnership with the City of Wagga Wagga starting in April 2009.

On 27 May 2010, the AAPA campus at Wagga Wagga Airport was officially opened by Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Anthony Albanese.

On 19 November 2019, AAPA purchased ST Aerospace Academy Australia at Ballarat Airport in Victoria, taking it over as a second campus.

In addition to training aircraft, the flight school has five flight simulators, including a full motion Saab 340 simulator. There is also one retired Saab 340B at Wagga Wagga used as a training aid.

On 3 November 2024, it was confirmed that AAPA was up for sale after Rex Airlines went into administration in July 2024. It was reported that there was interest from over 40 parties based both domestically and internationally.
