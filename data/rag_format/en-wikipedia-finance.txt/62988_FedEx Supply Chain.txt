## History


### Early history

In 1898, Hyman Shear began operating a drayage company known as H. Shear Trucking Company. Leading a blind horse with a wagon, Hyman delivered commodities to Pittsburgh and its surrounding communities. In 1917, H. Shear Trucking purchased its first gas-powered truck allowing the company to expand its delivery area. Within a short period of time, the company was operating seven trucks.

Shear's son Sam enrolled in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, at his father's urging. After graduating in 1930 Sam moved with his wife to Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood and bought a pharmacy. After nine years of running the Pharmacy, he joined his father's trucking business. Under Sam's leadership, the company's delivery fleet grew and warehousing and distribution services were added.


### 1960s-80s

By 1966, Shear Trucking Company employed over 20 drivers and was servicing customers such as Copperweld Steel, Mattel Toys, Kimberly-Clark, Kaufmann's and Gimbel's Department Store.

In 1971, Herb Shear - Sam's son - the third generation of the family, joined his father and expanded the company's base of operations to include public warehouse operations. The company was awarded the contract to provide the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board distribution services to Western Pennsylvania in 1975 and in 1988, Distribution Resources Inc. (DRI) was formed in Eastern Pennsylvania to provide customers with flexible labor-intense services including light product assembly, refurbishing, manipulation, and general distribution services.

Scanning Solutions, Inc., a division dedicated to the development of returns processing software and reclamation center management, was formed in the late â€˜80s. The company offered retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers with flexible, centralized returned goods processing and asset recovery services. Herb also pioneered a new software platform known as R-Log to manage Reverse logistics. GENCO became an industry leader in reverse logistics and liquidation services.


### 1990s-2015

1995 saw the consolidation of numerous company divisions and services under one banner name, "GENCO Distribution System". Along with the new name, came new concepts and developments in supply chain management. 1997 brought about new faces and services through the acquisition of Alpha & Omega; an established Pittsburgh-based warehouse management system (WMS) software development company.

GENCO ended the past century positioning itself with a broader range of services through the 1999 acquisition of two companies, Cumberland Distribution Services, building upon the company's base and history of distribution center management services; and Materials for Today's Learning / Joint Ventures, in the fulfillment industry. It also acquired IOgistics in 2003 and Capital Returns in 2005. In 2010 GENCO acquired publicly held Downers Grove, Illinois based ATC Technology Corp. The deal was valued at $512.6 million. After the acquisition the combined company came to be known as GENCO ATC.

Through the acquisition of GENCO ATC by FedEx in 2015, FedEx Supply Chain was formed. FedEx acquired the company for $1.4 billion.
