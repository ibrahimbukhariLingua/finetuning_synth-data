## History


### Pre-1987

Durell was founded in 1983 by Robert White. Up to 1987, Durell developed 19 games for various 8-bit computers such as Oric-1, ZX Spectrum, C64, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and Amstrad CPC. Their biggest hit was *Harrier Attack* that sold over 250,000 copies, including 100,000 bundled with the Amstrad CPC.


### Post-1987

Toward the end of 1987 Durell Software sold the rights to publish most of their existing games to Elite Systems and changed focus to developing financial services software for the IFA, insurance and mortgage broking industries. Currently over 1,000 advisers and brokers use Durell's software.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2005 Mike Richardson, author of many of Durell's best selling titles for the ZX Spectrum, founded Durell Games Ltd. The first game to be developed by the company was *Harrier Attack II*, a sequel to their best-selling 8-bit game, which did not repeat its predecessors' success.
