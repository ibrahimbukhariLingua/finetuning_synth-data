Carlton was a dry goods store clerk in Colorado Springs. Latching on to the 1891 gold boom in Cripple Creek, Carlton started a freight hauling business from Colorado Midland at Divide with his brother, Leslie. The Colorado Trading and Transfer Company served the mining communities, and "eventually gained control of much of the freight business" serving the mining towns. Based upon the income from his freight business, Carlton invested in mines, banks and railroads.

He invested in the Colorado Midland Railroad to carry freight and in businesses in Cripple Creek.


## King of Cripple Creek

He was named "King of Cripple Creek" due to the success of his mines there, including Cresson Mine,"one of the most profitable mines in the town." He owned "nearly every mine in Cripple Creek" and became a millionaire by 1930.


## Carlton House

Carlton and his wife, Ethel Frizzell-Carlton, built the Carlton House in Pine Valley, Colorado Springs. Carlton purchased the property in 1928 from William A. Otis to build a home for his wife. Mrs. Carlton had become enamored of the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture during her travels across Southern California. Subsequently, architect Richard Requa was hired to design their home. The house was a "leading social center in the region." He preferred to live at The Broadmoor resort and never lived at the Pine Valley home.
