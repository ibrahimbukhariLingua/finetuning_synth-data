Form 4


# Form 4



**Form 4** is a United States SEC filing that relates to insider trading. Every director, officer and owner of more than 10 percent of a class of a particular company's equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 must file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission a statement of ownership regarding such security. The initial filing is on Form 3 and changes are reported on Form 4. The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities is on Form 5. The forms contain information on the reporting person's relationship to the company and on purchases and sales of such equity securities.

Form 4 is stored in SEC's EDGAR database and academic researchers make these reports freely available as structured datasets in the Harvard Dataverse.

A Form 4 must be filed before the end of the second business day following a change in ownership of securities or derivative securities (including the exercise or grant of stock options) for individuals subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
