## History

Chifley Business School was born out of the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia (APESMA). APESMA introduced a Graduate Diploma of Management postgraduate course of study aimed largely at professional engineers. The course launched in 1989 under the banner of APESMA Management Education and had 747 students enrol, which made it the largest online postgraduate management program in Australia at its commencement.

In the following years, new postgraduate courses were introduced and were offered as joint awards with Deakin University. In 1998, APESMA Management Education welcomed its 5000th graduate.

In 2002, APESMA Management Education alumni welcomed its 10,000th graduate. APESMA also establishes an agency agreement to market its postgraduate programs in India and the United Arab Emirates.

In 2004, APESMA Management Education was rebranded as Chifley Business School.
