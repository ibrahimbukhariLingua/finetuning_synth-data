### Business books

Rickertsen has published two business books based on his industry experience, *Buyout: The Insider's Guide to Buying Your Own Company* and *Sell Your Business Your Way: Getting Out, Getting Rich, and Getting on with Your Life.*

Acclaimed writer Michael Lewis, who wrote the forewords to both books, said of *Buyout*, "Only insiders know how this stuff works. Rickertsen is an insider. He brings the complexity of high finance to its knees and leaves it begging for mercy. He explains its inner workings so that even a journalist can understand them."

Other high-profile leaders echoed this sentiment in their reviews.

NFL and political legend Jack Kemp said that "Rick is one of America's most gifted buyout experts. Anyone interested in an inside look of the buyout world and the opportunities for managers in these deals will learn volumes from this book."

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote, "This is a comprehensive guide for any business owner, large or small, on how to strategize on the sale and maximize value for their companies. And it is written in accessible terms without a lot of Wall Street jargon. It is a valuable resource."

Former Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen wrote, "Rick Rickertsen is one of the most insightful and thoughtful finance professionals I have known. His newest book will become the blueprint for selling companies on the best terms and prices. It is a very smart read by a very gifted writer and thinker."

Marriott International Executive Chairman Bill Marriott wrote, "I worked with Rick when we acquired Ritz-Carlton. He's an excellent deal maker and has written a must-read for every manager with the dream of buying and running his own company. It's a tremendous asset."

Investor David Bonderman, founder of the Texas Pacific Group, suggested that "After reading Rickertsen's insider view on leveraged deals, no one in America will want to work for wages again."

Finally, as a member of the Entrepreneurship Faculty at the Wharton School, Dr. Terrence LaPier predicted that *Buyout* was "Likely to become the essential manual for management buyouts. This high-impact book will be required reading for every entrepreneurial-minded MBA, manager, seller of a company, and professional in the buyout and M&A business."

*Buyout* has been translated into four languages and sold over 100,000 copies. It remains in print after nearly 20 years in the market.
