## History

The company was formed as City of London Brewery Company Limited in 1860 to acquire Calverts, a family brewing business at Upper Thames Street in the City of London. In 1932, the name was changed to The City of London Brewery and Investment Trust Limited, parts of the business having been sold and the proceeds invested in securities according to investment trust principles. In 1968, the remaining part of the brewery business was sold and the Company concentrated exclusively on investments in securities.

In 1970, the Company appointed Touche Remnant as Investment Manager and in 1982 the name was changed to TR City of London Trust PLC. In 1992, Touche, Remnant & Co. was acquired by Henderson Administration Group plc. The name of the company was changed to The City of London Investment Trust plc in October 1997.
