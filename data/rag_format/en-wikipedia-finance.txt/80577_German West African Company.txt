German West African Company


# German West African Company



The **German West African Company**, in German **Deutsch-Westafrikanische Gesellschaft / Compagnie**, was a German chartered company, founded in 1885. It exploited the two German protectorates in German West Africa (Togo and Cameroon) but did not actually govern them â€” unlike its counterpart in German East Africa.


## History

The German West African Company was established as a chartered company with a headquarters in Hamburg. The company was active in both Kamerun and Togoland. Following years of little profits, the company was absorbed by the German Empire on November 13, 1903.
