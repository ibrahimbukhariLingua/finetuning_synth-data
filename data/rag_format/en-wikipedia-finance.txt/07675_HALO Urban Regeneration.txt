HALO Urban Regeneration


# HALO Urban Regeneration



**HALO Urban Regeneration** is a Scottish business innovation park, urban regeneration and business start-up support company, founded, based and headquartered in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland. The HALO Urban Regeneration was founded by entrepreneur Marie Macklin CBE in 2006 as HALO Urban Regeneration Company Ltd., having announced the project a few years prior to official funding and creation of the HALO Kilmarnock.

The HALO building on Hill Street, Kilmarnock, is a £63 million brownfield urban regeneration project constructed on a 23-acre site, formerly the home of Johnnie Walker, the world’s leading Scotch whisky brand that was founded in Kilmarnock in 1820 and operated on the site until Diageo closed the Kilmarnock plant in 2012.

HALO is projected to generate £205 million to the Economy of Scotland and stimulate 1,500 jobs.

### Origins and establishment

Following the 2009 announcement of the closure of the Johnnie Walker whisky bottling unit and production factory in Kilmarnock, owners Diageo began seeking proposals for future leasing of the Hill Street site that occupied that 32-acre site at that time. Diageo gifted eight acres to Kilmarnock College (a campus of Ayrshire College since 2013) in 2012 to allow the construction of a new multi-million pound campus to replace the ageing building that was constructed during the 1960s.

Marie Macklin CBE, Chief Executive of The KLIN Group at the time, who had already undertaken numerous projects in and around Kilmarnock to restore derelict buildings in the town centre, submitted a proposal for a new, innovative hub to provide office space for startup companies and opportunities to enhance Kilmarnock's urban regeneration work.


### Ayrshire Growth Deal

The HALO Urban Regeneration benefitted as part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal, an economic recovery agreement between the Scottish Government, UK Government, East Ayrshire Council, North Ayrshire Council and South Ayrshire Council, with the Scottish Government and UK Government both providing £3.5 million of investment for the company and the regeneration of the former Johnnie Walker site.

Diageo who owned the land when occupied by the former Johnnie Walker bottling and production plant facility donated the land for a cost of £1 and under the Ayrshire Growth Deal has been committed to a contribution of £2 million to support planning and design of the HALO development as well as long-term sustainability of the Hill Street site as a consequence for closing the Johnnie Walker facility.


### Construction and opening

A planning application for permission for construction work on the new project was submitted to the planning advisory board of East Ayrshire Council, was planning permission granted by the council in 2018. The cost of the development was estimated to be £65 million, with the Scottish Government announcing a £5.3 million investment in the HALO Project in August 2017, with £1.8 million to be focused on low carbon emissions which was ultimately unused.

Morrison Construction was appointed as main contractor for the construction of the complex in September 2019, with construction work initially scheduled to be completed by January 2021, however this was delayed as a result of the halt on construction works in Scotland due to the COVID-19 pandemic and phase one opened March 2022

The building in Kilmarnock is a 4-storey mixed used structure and constructed from three main materials - dark brick, curtain wall glazing and a perforated aluminium screen at roof level, features a round LED dome on the roof which illuminates at nighttime. Phase 1 of the complex was completed in July 2021 (the HALO Enterprise & Innovation Hub), with future phases of the sites development consisting of a series of live and work units, a leisure facility, nursery, and over 200 houses. The building has become a symbol of regeneration in Kilmarnock, both in terms of redevelopment of land as well as economic regeneration and recovery.


### Expansion

A second HALO project is scheduled to begin planning and construction in Northern Ireland.

The HALO is scheduled to begin planning and construction of new premises to focus on urban regeneration projects in both Wales and England. The timescale for completion on these projects in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have still to be announced.
