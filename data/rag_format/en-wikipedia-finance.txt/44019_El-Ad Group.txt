## Controversies

Elad's purchase of New York City's Plaza Hotel caused great controversy in 2004.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ But as the hotel was readied for opening on March 1, 2008, *The New York Times* observed, Tshuva and Peter Ward, president of the New York's hotel workers' union, had reconciled their differences: "It was a big change from early 2005, when Mr. Ward vowed to block Mr. Tshuva's plans to convert most of the hotel into luxury condos and reconfigure some of its Edwardian public spaces into upscale shops, moves he contended would force union members out of work".

On May 15, 2007, the company announced plans to purchase the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada, with plans to raze the current structure and build a new resort to be branded as Las Vegas Plaza. It sold for a record $33 million per acre.

In August 2007, Elad Properties faced a lawsuit between itself and the Plaza Hotel & Casino owner, Tamares Group.
