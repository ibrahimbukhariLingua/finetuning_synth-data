## History


### Sears Holdings

On November 17, 2004, the management of Kmart Holding Corporation announced its intention to purchase Sears, Roebuck and Co. under a new corporation. Kmart previously emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 6, 2003. The new corporation became known as Sears Holdings Corporation, simply known as Sears Holdings. The new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the Sears and Kmart brands. The merger of Kmart and Sears closed on March 24, 2005, following affirmative shareholder votes of both companies. The result of the merger was Kmart and parent Kmart Holding Corporation and Sears became subsidiaries of the new Sears Holdings Corporation. Sears Holdings then operated Sears and Kmart stores. The company continued to market products under brands held by both companies. The merger was completed on March 24, 2005, after receiving regulatory approval from the government and approval by shareholders of both companies. The combined company had approximately 3,500 stores at the time of the merger.

Eddie Lampert led the company for the next thirteen years. (See Sears Holdings#History for more detailed history of the intervening years.)

On October 10, 2018, it was reported that Sears Holdings had engaged advisors regarding an imminent bankruptcy filing.

The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 15, 2018, in New York; the same day that a $134 million debt payment was due.

On October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings announced that it would close 142 stores, including 63 Kmart stores and 79 Sears stores. Sears Holdings' bankruptcy also marked Kmart's second bankruptcy in 16 years. On November 8, 2018, Sears Holdings announced it would close an additional 40 stores, including 11 Kmart and 29 Sears stores. On November 23, 2018, Sears Holdings released a list of 505 stores, including 239 Kmart and 266 Sears stores, that are for sale in the bankruptcy process while all others are currently holding liquidation sales. However, the stores for sale are not guaranteed to be protected from liquidation in the future. On December 28, 2018, Sears Holdings announced it would close 80 additional stores, including 37 Kmart and 43 Sears stores.

In a proposal announced in early January, Sears Holdings plans only to keep 202 Kmart stores along with 223 Sears stores open, assuming that it survives the bankruptcy process. Most of the proposed locations are in highly populated coastal regions.

On January 15, 2019, when it had appeared that Sears Holdings was preparing to file for Chapter 7 liquidation, the bankruptcy court judge ordered the company to return to negotiation table and work out a new deal with Eddie Lampert to prevent the liquidation from occurring. A new deal was struck at the last minute that would keep up to 400 Sears and Kmart stores operating. On January 19, 2019, Sears Holdings officially announced that they had won the auction, and that some of the then existing stores were to remain open.

On January 24, 2019, a group of unsecured creditors, which included Simon Property Group, filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to overturn the deal Sears Holdings had recently made with Lampert claiming that Lampert had been "engaged in serial asset stripping" of the company at the expense of suppliers and landlords. The creditors had requested that the bankruptcy court rule to have the company be liquidated instead of being reorganized so that the creditors would be able to recover more money that was still owed to them. On January 28, the federal government-operated Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation announced that they were not in favor of the current Sears Holding agreement with Lampert since that agreement would create a $1.7 billion funding gap in the employee pension fund that would require the American tax-payers to cover the shortfall. In papers filed on February 1 with the bankruptcy court, ESL "outlined plans to close three Kmart stores per month in 2019" if the court decides to accept ESL's purchase bid.

In February 2019, it was announced that a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the most lucrative part of Sears Holdings to Edward Lampert allowing the surviving part of the company that operates both Sears and Kmart to remain in business at the expense of suppliers, landlords, employees, pensioners, the U.S. government, and other creditors. Kmart would have 202 locations after the sale is completed.


### Birth of Transformco

In February 2019, the company finalized the acquisition of 425 stores (223 Sears and 202 Kmart) from Sears Holdings for $5.2 billion. Stores not purchased by Transformco were immediately liquidated. During bankruptcy proceeding of Sears Holdings, ESL, the parent company of both "old Sears" and "new Sears", told the court that it had "plans to close three Kmart stores per month in 2019" if the court decides to accept ESL's purchase bid.

In June 2019, Sears customers discovered that they were having a hard time getting warranties honored for items previously purchased from Sears.

At least one source reported in November 2019 that Transformco would have a total of 182 full Sears and Kmart stores remaining after the 96 announced stores were closed by February 2020.

In December 2019, Transformco sold the DieHard brand to Advance Auto Parts for $200 million. Under this agreement, Sears and Kmart can continue to sell DieHard branded batteries through their stores while Advance Auto Parts has exclusive rights to the DieHard brand in the automotive and vehicular supplies and service industries.

On February 6, 2020, Transformco announced an additional closure of 15 Kmarts and 26 Sears, effective to close around April 2020.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Throughout June and July 2020, Sears' job website has indicated that over twenty more stores are closing.

## Transforming into a commercial real estate company

In a June 2023 interview with the president for real estate at Transformco Scott Carr, Carr explained that the company was "transition[ing] from being a retailer with real estate to becoming a real estate operating company." In an earlier statement, Carr stated that "Transformco continues to pursue opportunities to create value from its real estate portfolio and to partner with retailers, property owners and communities as part of the ongoing reinvention of retail real estate."

In 2022, Transformco formed a partnership with New Jersey-based developer Russo Development to build 530 rental units and 190 for-sale units on the site of a former Sears store in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with construction expected to be completed by 2027. The development also includes a grocery store and a restaurant.


## Sears Hometown Stores

On June 3, 2019, it was announced that Transformco would acquire Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores.
