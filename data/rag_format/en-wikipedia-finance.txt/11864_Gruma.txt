**Gruma, S.A.B. de C.V.**, known as **Gruma**, is a Mexican multinational corn flour (masa) and tortilla manufacturing company headquartered in San Pedro, near Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. It is the largest corn flour and tortilla manufacturer in the world. Its brand names include **Mission Foods** (Misión in Mexico), **Maseca**, and **Guerrero**.

Gruma reported revenues of US$3.8 billion for 2014. It operates more than 79 plants worldwide, mainly in Mexico, the United States, and Europe, and employs approximately 18,000 people. It is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange since 1994, and it had a NYSE listing through ADRs from 1998 to September 2015. It is a constituent of the IPC, the main benchmark index of Mexican stocks.


## History

The first industrial production facility of corn flour in the world was opened in 1949 under the name "**M**olino**s A**zt**eca**, S.A. de C.V.", later shortened to "Grupo Maseca". Expansion quickly led to the government of Costa Rica inviting the company to invest in that country, in 1973. From then on, a long tradition of investments outside of Mexico was followed. In 1977, Grupo Maseca opened a subsidiary in California, pioneering in the production of tortilla in the United States. It would be in Texas, in 1982, where Maseca would open the first production facility of nixtamalized corn flour in that country.

The election of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a close family friend of Grupo Maseca president Roberto Gonzalez Barrera, allowed Gruma to grow substantially while hastening the decline of traditional masa and tortilla production. In 1990, the Mexican Department of Commerce under Salinas's administration instituted limits on the overall amount of fresh corn purchased at a support price by CONASUPO, requiring all further growth in the corn market to come from corn flour instead. The only two corn flour providers at the time were Grupo Maseca and the publicly-owned Miconsa; the latter was mismanaged by Salinas's administration to the point of losing almost all of its market share, leaving Gruma with a near-monopoly. Salinas also changed government policy to incentivize tortillerias to use Maseca rather than fresh masa, punishing those who refused with lower-quality corn and stricter grain limits.

By 1990, the company had subsidiaries in North America and Central America, including the United States, Honduras, and Costa Rica. It was in this year when the company made its initial public offering in the Mexican Stock Exchange as "GIMSA", or "Grupo Industrial Maseca".

Gruma consolidated itself as a holding company after acquiring 10% of Banorte in 1992. From then on, a history of expansions would open subsidiaries around the world, including one in Coventry, England in 2000, and another one in Shanghai, China in 2006, also recently in Ukraine in 2010.


## Controversies

Gruma has faced criticism for its continued operations in Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Despite widespread international sanctions and calls for businesses to withdraw from the Russian market, Gruma maintains one production plant within the country. This decision has drawn scrutiny and raised concerns about the company's ethical considerations and its alignment with international efforts to pressure Russia.
