## History

The first Rockefeller Group Business Center service office was opened in 1994 at 45 Rockefeller Plaza. Rockefeller Group saw the increase in business centers and decided to venture into the industry. They purchased a floor at 45 Rockefeller Plaza and converted it into a business center. Subsequently, additional offices were opened, including at 48 Wall Street, which was opened in 2001. 48 Wall Street is a historic building itself, built in 1928 as the Bank of New York Building. Its former banking hall has been modified to house the Museum of American Finance, which moved there in October 2007. In June 2012 the historic Rockefeller Group Business Centers were completely refurbished to include updated technology, new offices, conference rooms, and staffed reception areas.
