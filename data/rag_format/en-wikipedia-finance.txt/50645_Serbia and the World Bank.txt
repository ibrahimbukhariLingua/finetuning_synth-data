# Serbia and the World Bank



The World Bank Group is a family of five international organizations that have provided leveraged loans and monetary assistance to the Southeastern European country of Serbia with aim to contribute country's goal of integration into the European Union through the establishment of inclusive and competitive economy.


## History

Following its founding in 1944, the World Bank funded numerous essential projects in Serbia, from the Belgrade-Bar railway in 1964. ( $658 million equivalent), to the Ibar-Lepenac hydro system in 1986 and Kolubara A thermal power plant in 1991.

The period under international economic sanctions (1992-1995), civil war, infrastructure-damaging NATO airstrikes in 1999 resulted in record-breaking hyperinflation and fall of Serbian economy below the levels of 1990.

After the expulsion of Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in September 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government executed stabilization measurements and initiated market reform program. Serbia rejoined the World Bank and renewed its membership in the International Monetary Fund in the December of 2000.

Between the years 2001 and 2008, the World Bank provided funds for 32 projects in Serbia with the combined cost of over $1 billion aimed to improve Serbia’s banking, education, energy, public finance, and social sectors. The WBG contributed to the privatization of several state and socially-owned companies, assisted in the modernization of frontier passages, reformation of the judiciary system, road reconstruction, addressed improvement environment, health, and employment services.
