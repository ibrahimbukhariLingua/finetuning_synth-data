# Oregon State University College of Business



The **Oregon State University College of Business** is one of 12 colleges based at Oregon State University's Corvallis, Oregon campus. The college offers business coursework and degrees to students studying at the main campus, OSU-Cascades campus in Bend, or anywhere in the world through the university's Ecampus. Coursework in business has been offered at OSU since the late 1800s, making the college one of the oldest public business schools in the state.

As of 2022, the college of business claimed an enrollment of nearly 4,000 students. The college offers undergraduate degrees in accounting, business information systems, finance, management, marketing, apparel design, graphic design, interior design and merchandising management. An MBA program is also offered through the college with tracks in organizational leadership, accountancy, business analytics, commercialization, global operations, marketing, research thesis, and wealth management. Classes in business analytics are offered in Portland, in addition to Corvallis, as well as a track in executive leadership. In 2014, the college expanded graduate-level instruction by adding a Ph.D. program with options in accounting and innovation/commercialization

The college moved into its new $55 million, 100,000-square-foot home in 2014. Austin Hall is named after college alumnus and A-dec founder Ken Austin and his wife, Joan, who are the principal donors for the building project.
The college's Austin Entrepreneurship Program and Austin Family Business Program are also named after the longtime university philanthropists.


## History

Instruction in business was first offered at OSU in 1898, and the first degree in business was awarded in 1904. Four years later, the university created the school of commerce, naming John Andrew Bexell as dean. Over the period Bexell headed the school, the name changed three times. It was briefly known as the Division of Business and Industry, then the School of Business and Technology, and finally the School of Business. Oregon State stood as the only public university in the state to offer a degree in business through 1914. In 1922 the school moved into the new Commerce Hall, which was renamed Bexell Hall in 1966. In 1983 the program was renamed the OSU College of Business.

For several deans, changes in leadership were infrequent. Bexell was on the job for 23 years, following a 10-year hiatus in business degree curriculum during the Great Depression. Clifford E. Maser then took over and served for 24 years with one year on hiatus in 1963, followed by Earl Goddard, who held the post for 15 years.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Currently, Tim Carroll serves as the college's 12th dean.
