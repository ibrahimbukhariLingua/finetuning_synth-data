European Business Awards for the Environment


# European Business Awards for the Environment



**European Business Awards for the Environment** are awarded by the European Union to recognise companies that combine competitiveness with respect for the environment.

The awards take into consideration voluntary schemes such as EMAS and Ecolabel, together with other comparable projects, which demonstrate commitment to develop and apply sustainable management practices. The awards were originally established in 1987 as the European Better Environment Awards for Industry, renamed in 2000 as the European Awards for the Environment, and renamed again in 2004 as the current European Business Awards for the Environment.

The award is presented in five categories: Management, Product and services, Process innovation, International business cooperation and Business and biodiversity.
