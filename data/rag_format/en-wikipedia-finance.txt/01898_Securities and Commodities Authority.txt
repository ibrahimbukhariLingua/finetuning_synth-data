Securities and Commodities Authority


# Securities and Commodities Authority



The **Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA)** is a federal financial regulatory agency in the United Arab Emirates. It was established based on Federal Decree No. (4) of 2000 by then-president of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and it's amendments issued in Federal Law 25 of 2006, amending the former law.

The authority is a federal government agency, which is financially and administratively independent, headed by a CEO and a chairman of a board of directors, both appointed by the President of the UAE. The main objective of the authority is to supervise and monitor financial markets in the UAE, including the Dubai Financial Market and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. However, it is not responsible for regulating financial activity in free economic zones such as the Dubai International Financial Centre, which are regulated by independent laws and courts such as the DIFC Courts.


## History

The Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) was established by Federal Law No. (4) of 2000 enacted by Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as the first legislation for securities in the UAE and was initially named Emirates Securities & Commodities Authority and Market. The first two exchange markets, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and the Dubai Financial Market would be founded shortly after in the same year.

In 2004, Dubai established the Dubai Financial Services Authority, which would be the sole regulatory authority for the economic free zone of Dubai International Financial Centre, which included independent exchanges such as Nasdaq Dubai outside of the control of the SCA.

In 2006, UAE president Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan issued Law 25 of 2006 amending certain provisions of the prior law, removing the requirement of the board of directors to represent various governmental departments and the reducing the board of directors from 8 board members to 5 and expanding the requirement for board members to declare any securities or stock they own, or stock owned by the board member's family and minor children.
