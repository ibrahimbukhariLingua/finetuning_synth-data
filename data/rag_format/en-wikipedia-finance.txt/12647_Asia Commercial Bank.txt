## Controversies

According to PetroTimes, on August 22, 2012, Lý Xuân Hải - General Director of ACB - was ordered to be detained for 4 months by the Supreme People's Procuracy. Hải was prosecuted and taken into custody to investigate acts of intentionally violating State regulations on economic management. Tuổi Trẻ Online confirmed this the next day. On the same day, it was reported by VnExpress that ACB's Board of Directors had approved Hải's resignation letter for personal reasons, and appointed Đỗ Minh Toàn as General Director since August 23. As revealed by Toàn, customers withdrew 5 billion VND (240 million USD) from the bank on Wednesday, August 22.

On September 19, 2012, ACB announced their approval of resignation by Chairman Trần Xuân Giá and 2 Vice Chairmen, Lê Vũ Kỳ and Trịnh Kim Quang, due to their involvement in Hải's case. On the same day, Eximbank's management approved Phạm Trung Cang's resignation from the position of Vice Chairman. Trương Văn Phước - Eximbank's General Director - said that Cang resigned because he needed time to explain his responsibilities during his previous working time at ACB.

On September 27, the Ministry of Public Security informed that the four defendants - Trần Xuân Giá, Lê Vũ Kỳ, Trịnh Kim Quang, and Phạm Trung Cang - had been prosecuted, and were currently forbidden to leave their residence. Those previous managers of ACB were accused of having issued a policy of entrusting employees to use ACB's capital in contravention of regulations, causing serious consequences. They were accomplices with the two people arrested earlier, former general director Lý Xuân Hải and former vice chairman Nguyễn Đức Kiên. The investigating agency assessed that their actions were contrary to the provisions of Article 106 of the Law on Credit Institutions and the guiding circular of the State Bank - and has caused loss of hundreds of billions of VND.
