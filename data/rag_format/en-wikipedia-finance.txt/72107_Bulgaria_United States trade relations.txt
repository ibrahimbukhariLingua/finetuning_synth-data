Bulgaria–United States trade relations


# Bulgaria–United States trade relations



**Bulgarian-American trade** has grown steadily since Bulgaria changed from a socialist to a market economy, and particularly since Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union in 2007. In 2007, the first and second largest investments in the Bulgarian economy were made by U.S. firms.

U.S. investments made in Bulgaria between September 1992 and September 2006 amounted to a total of over one billion dollars, which made the United States the eighth largest investor in the country. During the same period, the U.S. was Bulgaria's ninth largest trading partner. The U.S. is the only non-EU country in the top ten foreign investors in Bulgaria.

Bilateral trade has been steadily growing since 1999. Two-way merchandise trade is just under $1 billion with US exports to Bulgaria reaching $491 million and Bulgarian exports at $439 million in 2006.

Bulgaria's exports to the United States amounted to three percent of its total exports in 2005, and the share of imports from the USA stood at two percent.

In 2007,U.S. Ambassador John Beyrle and Bulgarian Ambassador to the United States Elena Poptodorova toured several U.S. cities to encourage more and investment and trade between the U.S. and Bulgaria.
