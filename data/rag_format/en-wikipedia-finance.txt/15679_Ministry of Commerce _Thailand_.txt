The **Ministry of Commerce** (Abrv: MOC; Thai: กระทรวงพาณิชย์, RTGS: **Krasuang Phanit**) is a cabinet ministry in the government of Thailand. The Minister of Commerce is a member of the Cabinet of Thailand. The ministry is responsible for trade, prices of important agricultural goods, consumer protection, entrepreneurship, insurance, intellectual property protection, exports, and representing Thailand at the World Trade Organization.

Prince Kitiyakara Voralaksana, the older half-brother of King Vajiravudh was appointed as the first president of the council, with a status equivalent to that of a minister.
