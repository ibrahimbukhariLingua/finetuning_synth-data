**Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc.** (Hebrew: אורמד), is a publicly traded company engaged in the development of oral drug delivery systems – most notably an oral insulin capsule for treating type 2 diabetes. The company was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Jerusalem. Its shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.


## History

Oramed Pharmaceuticals was founded in 2006 by Miriam Kidron, a scientist at the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, and her son Nadav Kidron.


## Product pipeline

Oramed considers its flagship product to be an oral insulin capsule developed to treat sufferers of type 2 diabetes. The Company is currently conducting Phase 3 trials, under the FDA, for oral insulin in Type 2 diabetes.

In addition to the oral insulin capsule, Oramed is developing an exenatide-based capsule designed to balance blood sugar levels and control appetite, and is conducting clinical trials for the treatment of NASH with oral insulin.

In 2021, Oramed created a subsidiary, Oravax Medical, to bring an oral Covid-19 vaccine to market.

In January 2023, Phase 3 trial of Oramed's orally administered insulin for Type 2 diabetes patients failed thus causing the share price to plunge.

In May 2023, Ben Shapiro invested $4.7 million and was named to the board of directors.
