## History

After talks concerning a possible merger of Fiducia IT AG (IT service provider for cooperative financial network in southern Germany, based in Karlsruhe) and GAD eG (the equivalent in northern Germany, based in Münster) had failed in previous years, negotiations were again picked up in late 2013. This time, both companies came to an agreement, resulting in the respective supervisory boards giving their assent in October 2014, followed by the owners of both companies in November and December 2014 respectively. The merger was finalized on 1 July 2015.


## Services offered

Atruvia currently operates two core banking applications "agree21" and "bank21". The banks associated with the former GAD eG currently employ the core banking application “bank21”, whereas the application used by those banks associated with the former Fiducia IT AG was called “agree”. By 2019 all German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanks are to be migrated to the new joint banking application “agree21”, which is primarily based on agree.

Atruvia AG also provides data centre services, a range of IT solutions including outsourcing, support and training, IT infrastructure services and hardware products.
