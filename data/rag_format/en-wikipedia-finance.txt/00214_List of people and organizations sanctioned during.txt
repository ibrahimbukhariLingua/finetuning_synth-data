List of people and organizations sanctioned during the Russo-Ukrainian War


# List of people and organizations sanctioned during the Russo-Ukrainian War



Various sanctions against Russia and its affiliates have been imposed by major economic and political powers in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the United States, the member states of the European Union (EU), and other international organizations.

In response, Russia has imposed its own sanctions against other countries, which include a complete ban on food imports from Australia, Canada, Norway, the United States, and the European Union.


## By Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and Australia


### Prior to 2022 invasion

The European Union, United States, and Canada imposed an initial round of sanctions on 17 March 2014, and, on 11 April, Albania, Iceland and Montenegro announced that they would be following suit. On 28 April, the US expanded its sanctions to include 17 Russian companies, with Japan, Canada, and Australia, taking similar actions soon thereafter.

The EU also joined the 28 April sanctions and, in addition, instructed the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to suspend the signature of new financing operations in Russia. The EU continued to expand the scope and duration of its sanctions over the following months, agreeing to extend the existing sanctions on 150 individuals and 38 companies for another six months in March 2018. The EU also added five individuals—Natalya Ivanovna Berzruchenko, Inna Nikolayevna Guzeyeva, Aleksandr Yurevich Petukhov, Miroslav Aleksandrovich Pogorelov, and Anastasiya Nikolayevna Karpranova—to their sanctions lists for their involvement with, and organization of, the March 2018 Russia presidential elections in Crimea and Sevastopol that May.

Switzerland, although not an EU member, mirrored the Union's sanctions, a historic deviation from the country's stance of semi-complete political and wartime neutrality, citing a "serious violation of the most fundamental norms of international law within the scope of its political room for manoeuver."

New Zealand imposed "largely symbolic" sanctions in May 2014, and in September 2014, Australia placed Russia, Crimea, and Sevastopol on the Australian autonomous sanctions list in response to the Russian threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, while Japan sanctioned Russian military-related technology and five major Russian banks (VTB Bank, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank, and the Russian Agricultural Bank).

Since first imposing its sanctions in 2014, the US has expanded them several times, including in December 2015 and April 2018.

As of 24 May 2018, Ukraine's sanctions list named more than 1000 individuals and more than 400 entities.

### Removal from sanctions list

In early-March 2014, the European Union froze all funds belonging to Raisa Bohatyriova on suspicion of her illegal use of budget funds. It was reported in 2016 that, according to the Ukrainian government, she had since repaid government funds that had been allegedly misappropriated. For this, her funds in the EU were unfrozen on 6 March 2016.

## By Russia


### Prior to 2022

In May 2014, Russia sanctioned more individuals from the United States and Canada, but the list has not yet been revealed.

After a member of the German Bundestag was denied entry into Russia in May 2015, Russia released a blacklist to the European Union governments of 89 politicians and officials from the EU who are not allowed entry into Russia under the present sanctions regime. Russia asked for the blacklist to not be made public

. The list is said to include eight Swedes, as well as two Member of Parliament (MPs) and two Member of the European Parliament (MEPs) from the Netherlands. Finland's national broadcaster *Yle* published a leaked German version of the list.

In January and March 2015, three politicians from Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland were blocked from entering Russia due to alleged "anti-Russian activities."

On October 22, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on special economic measures in relation to Ukraine's unfriendly actions against Russian individuals and entities. On August 21, 2021, Russia expanded its economic sanctions on Ukrainian individuals and included Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov. The updated version of the list of sanctioned individuals, approved by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, was published on the government website containing legal information. The sanctions include freezing non-cash accounts and other assets in Russia and a ban on capital transfers from Russia. The number of sanctioned Ukrainian individuals rose from 849 to 922.

**Removal from sanction list**

Russia has lifted targeted sanctions to allow US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland to visit Moscow for meetings with Russian officials on October 12, 2021.

Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, said Nuland was in the sanctions list that prohibits individuals from entering the country, but it has been removed after the US nixed a similar restriction, barring a Russian citizen from entering the country.

"Indeed, she was on a sanction list. It means that such a person cannot cross the border. They put Russian representatives on their sanction lists, hence, in this case the matter was settled on the parity basis," said Zakharova in an interview on the Rossiya 1 television channel.

Zakharova confirmed that the US had removed some Russian representatives from their sanction lists, and said Nuland's visit to Russia was requested by the US."I think our Western partners should analyze this approach and understand that we can respond in a negative manner to negative things. We can also respond in a positive manner to positive things and have always been opting for the latter," she said. Zakharova later clarified to Govorit Moskva radio that one Russian citizen had been removed from the US sanctions list, but she did not disclose the person's name.

These people, from academic and pro-Banderite organizations, have been actively involved in the campaign to glorify Hitler's accomplices from the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists-Ukrainian Insurgent Army (OUN-UPA) and the Galicia division, including the disgraceful honoring of Nazi Jaroslav Gunko in the Canadian parliament.

#### Organizational sanctions

In March 2015, the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-being (Rospotrebnadzor) banned supplies of certain household chemicals made in Ukraine. In October 2015, Russia also put a ban on flights between Russia and Ukraine.

From 1 January 2016, Russia suspended the application of the Free Trade Agreement of the Commonwealth of Independent States ("CIS FTA") with respect to Ukraine because Ukraine entered into the Association Agreement with the EU providing Ukraine with access to the European single market in certain sectors. The CIS FTA partially entered into force on 1 January 2016 and became entirely effective on 1 September 2017. According to the CIS FTA, Ukraine cannot simultaneously participate in free trade zones with the EU and the CIS countries.

As a result of the suspension of the CIS FTA, the importation of goods originating from Ukraine to Russia has become subject to regular customs duties as specified in the Common Customs Tariff of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Russia also imposed a ban on the transit of certain goods (i.e., goods subject to customs duties other than 0% and the embargoed goods) by road and rail from Ukraine through Russia to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The transit of non-restricted goods (by road and rail) from Ukraine through Russia to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan should be carried out only through the territory of Belarus, provided that such goods have identification and tracking means, including those that are operating on the basis of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). The drivers of the vehicles, who are involved in road shipments, must have registration vouchers.

At the same time, the CIS FTA remains effective with regard to the exportation of natural gas in a gaseous state from Russia to Ukraine.

In May 2017, in response to Kyiv's ban on the operation of Russia's payment systems, Russia enacted a law restricting money transfers from Russia if a country restricts the operation of Russian payment systems in its territory. As a result, money transfers from Russia to Ukraine can only be performed via Russian systems. The new restrictions apply only to financial transfers conducted without opening a bank account.

In May 2017, Russia requested World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute consultations with Ukraine regarding the restrictions, prohibitions, requirements and procedures adopted and maintained by Ukraine in respect of trade in goods and services from Russia (Case No. DS525).

On 22 October 2018, the Russian president signed a decree calling for counter-sanctions against Ukraine and instructing the Russian government to draw up a list of companies and individuals that would be subject to economic restrictions under the new measures, and a list of the respective restrictions. On 29 December 2018, the Russian prime minister signed Resolution No. 1716-83 extending the import ban of Ukrainian goods (including agricultural products, raw materials, food products, industrial goods and certain personal hygiene products). Resolution No. 1716-83 introduced an import ban with respect to listed goods: (i) originating from Ukraine; (ii) that are supplied from Ukraine; or (iii) that were in transit through the territory of Ukraine. The import ban does not apply to listed goods that are transferred through Russia to third countries (subject to certain conditions).

On 18 April 2019, the Russian government enacted Governmental Resolution No. 460-25, which introduced two more lists to Resolution No. 1716-83, namely: (i) a list of oil, oil products and other goods that could not be exported from Russia to Ukraine; and (ii) a list of certain fuel and energy products that, from 1 June 2019, could not be exported from Russia to Ukraine without the permission of the Russian Ministry of Economic Development.

During 2019, the Russian government amended the lists of goods subject to the import and/or export ban several times by adding new goods to these lists and lifting the import and/or export ban on certain listed goods. The Russian government also set specific dates for the entry into force of the import ban with respect to certain listed products. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree expanding the list of Ukrainian companies that have economic sanctions imposed on them in connection with unfriendly actions of Ukraine. The document was published on the official portal of legal information on Friday.

The document introduces amendments to Appendix No. 2 to the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of November 1, 2018 No. 1300 on Measures to implement the decree of the president of the Russian Federation No. 592 of October 22, 2018.

In the original version of the document, the list of legal entities subject to special economic measures consisted of 68 companies. Later it was expanded to 75 entities.

Now the list comprises 84 companies that have economic sanctions on them. The new list includes nine more companies, in particular – Donmar LLC, Kranship LLC, Transship LLC and Poltava Auto Unit Plant PJSC.

The Russian government has approved a list of legal entities, which are subject to retaliatory sanctions. The relevant resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers was published on the official portal of legal information on May 11, 2022.

The list includes 31 companies from Germany, France and other European countries, as well as from the US and Singapore. In particular, it includes former European subsidiaries of Gazprom, traders and operators of underground gas storage facilities.

In particular, Russian authorities, legal entities and citizens will not be able to conclude transactions with the sanctioned entities and organizations under their control, fulfill obligations to them under completed transactions, and conduct financial transactions in their favor. This includes the concluded foreign trade contracts. These bans were earlier established by a decree of Putin.

The resolution sets additional criteria for transactions that are prohibited from being performed with companies in the sanctions list. These are transactions concluded in favor of the sanctioned persons, or providing for the making of payments, transactions with securities with the participation or in favor of such companies, or transactions involving the entry of ships owned or chartered by sanctioned persons, in their interest or on their behalf, into the Russian ports.

The resolution appoints the Russian Finance Ministry responsible for sending proposals to the Cabinet of Ministers on making changes to the list, as well as on granting temporary permits for certain transactions with persons under sanctions. The document comes into force from the date of its official publication.

Russia's sanctions list includes Gazprom Germania GmbH, Gazprom Schweiz AG, Gazprom Marketing & Trading USA Inc, Vemex, Wingas, EuRoPol GAZ.

On October 11, Russia's financial monitoring agency, Rosfinmonitoring, has added US tech giant Meta Platforms Inc, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, to its list of "terrorists and extremists".

On October 26, Russia banned dealings in the shares or share capital of 45 banks or banking units, all either owned by parties in countries that Russia terms "unfriendly" or owned through foreign capital. The list followed a decree issued on August 5 by President Vladimir Putin banning dealings in stakes in the financial and energy sectors owned by parties in "unfriendly" countries unless specific permission was given. The list included Russian units of Intesa Sanpaolo, Credit Suisse, Raiffeisen, Citi, OTP Bank, Western Union DP Vostok and UniCredit. Subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank, the French group BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, UBS, HSBC, JPMorgan, PayPal service, American Express payment system and others as well as the Russian Yandex-Bank and Ozon-Bank were present.

The list also includes many players specializing in car loans – subsidiaries of foreign automakers: MS Bank Rus (Mitsubishi); RN-Bank (owned by UniCredit and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi); Toyota Bank (indirectly controlled by Toyota); Mercedes-Benz Bank Rus (Mercedes-Benz Group); BMW Bank (indirectly controlled by BMW).

Russia's government has approved a list of legal entities subject to special economic measures in the area of military-technical cooperation. A corresponding decree has been signed, the cabinet's press service said in a statement on November 8, 2022.

"The list contains 74 entities from Bulgaria, the UK, Germany, Canada, Lithuania, Slovakia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Montenegro, Estonia and the US. Deals with the companies on the list in the area of military-technical cooperation are banned," the statement said.

The decree has been prepared pursuant to an order by Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘On use of retaliatory special economic measures due to hostile actions of certain foreign states and international organizations’.

### By Chechnya, against US and EU institutions' leaders

On 26 June 2014, the Head of the Russian republic of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, released a statement saying that he has created a sanction list which totaled four individuals. The people on the list have since been banned from entering the Chechen Republic and had all bank accounts frozen on 27 July 2014. This was in response to the EU sanctions.
