Oslo Business School


# Oslo Business School



**Oslo Business School** (*Handelshøyskolen*) is the graduate business school of Oslo Metropolitan University. Located in Oslo, Norway, the school offers study programs at both Bachelor and Master level, as well as a wide range of continuing and further education, in business administration, finance and management.


## History

In 1875 Oslo Commerce School (*Oslo Handelsgymnasium*) was established, making it the first school to offer a business education in Norway. In response to societal and industrial developments in Norway during the 1950s and 1960s, the school expanded its business education to college level, and in 1970 Oslo College of Business and Economics *(Økonomisk College)* was established. From 1977 the college offered a three-year program with specialization in accounting and auditing, and as of 1987 the college offered a three-year program with specialization in International Business.

In 1994, Oslo College of Business and Economics was moved to the newly-formed Oslo University College (HiO), and changed its name to *Økonomiutdanningen*. The name was later changed to *Institutt for økonomi og administrasjon*. In 2011 HiO merged with Akershus University College (HiAK) and formed Oslo and Akershus University College (HiOA). In the fall of 2012 the business school launched its first MBA (Master of Business Administration) program. In 2015 the school's name was changed yet again, this time to its current name of *Handelshøyskolen* (Oslo Business School). In 2018 HiOA became a state university and was renamed Oslo Metropolitan University.
