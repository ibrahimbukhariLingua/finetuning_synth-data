List of companies of Russia


# List of companies of Russia



Russia has a high-income mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Market reforms in the 1990s privatized much of Russian industry and agriculture, with notable exceptions to this privatization occurring in the energy and defense-related sectors.

Russia's vast geography is an important determinant of its economic activity, with some sources estimating that Russia contains over 30 percent of the world's natural resources. The World Bank estimates the total value of Russia's natural resources at US$75 trillion. Russia relies on energy revenues to drive most of its growth. Russia has an abundance of petroleum, natural gas and precious metals, which make up a major share of Russia's exports. As of 2012ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ
