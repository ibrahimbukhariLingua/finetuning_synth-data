## Organisation

New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) is New Zealand's international business development agency. Its role is to support New Zealand’s economic growth by helping businesses grow bigger, better, faster in international markets.

NZTE's strategy supports the Government's target to double the value of New Zealand’s exports by 2033/34. It works alongside other New Zealand Government agencies such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).

NZTE's products and services help businesses to grow and succeed internationally. These include strategic advice, access to networks, research and market intelligence. NZTE's services are aligned with different stages of a business lifecycle – from starting and growing a business, through to exporting and operating internationally. Some services are provided directly by NZTE staff in New Zealand and around the world, while others are provided externally, such as via Beachhead advisors – NZTE’s network of private sector business consultants.

NZTE has 10 offices in New Zealand and staff in 37 locations around the world, who work in partnership with New Zealand businesses to help them build strategic alliances, develop commercial relationships, boost capability and scale. NZTE Trade Commissioners and Business Development Managers based offshore connect businesses with opportunities and contacts in international markets. NZTE's focus is on international opportunities that match New Zealand's current / potential business capability and provide sustained economic benefit.

NZTE also helps connect international investors with New Zealand-based opportunities. This is in line with the Government’s strategy to attract high-quality investors to not only attract capital, but also to use their expertise and networks to help grow New Zealand business and deliver greater economic impact. NZTE works with both investors and investees on investment opportunities to accelerate the growth of New Zealand. NZTE global investment team uses its networks, commercial expertise and deep knowledge of New Zealand to bring investment and opportunity together.
