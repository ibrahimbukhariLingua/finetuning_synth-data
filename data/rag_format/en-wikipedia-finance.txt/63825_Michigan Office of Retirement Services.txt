# Michigan Office of Retirement Services



The **Michigan Office of Retirement Services** (ORS) administers retirement programs for Michigan's state employees, public school employees, judges, state police, and National Guard. ORS also provides various retiree healthcare benefits, including traditional insurance plans, Personal Healthcare Funds, and Health Reimbursement Accounts. ORS serves over 530,000 customers (approximately 227,000 active and 281,500 retired), representing one out of every fourteen Michigan adults. ORS customers live in approximately one out of every nine Michigan households. The state employee system and the public school employee system administered by ORS make up 95 percent of all active plan membership in Michigan. ORS is responsible for the 18th largest public pension system in the United States and the 47th largest pension system in the world, managing combined net assets of nearly $67.8 billion. In fiscal year 2017, ORS paid out over $7.3 billion in pension and health benefits. According to the Pensionomics 2016 report from the National Institute on Retirement Security, pensions paid to Michigan retirees generated $11.1 billion in total spending in the state of Michigan. A Pew study ranks ORS in the top ten state pension systems for paying the highest percentage of their annual required contribution for pension plans, which demonstrates a commitment to fiscal responsibility. ORS is a division of Michigan's Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (DTMB).


## History

The five retirement systems for which ORS provides services were separately established through public acts passed by the Michigan Legislature as early as 1942 and as recently as 1992. The systems evolved over time as the original legislation was amended, most recently due to the recent economic crisis. ORS moved to the Stevens T. Mason building in July 2015, as part of a larger move of state departments.
