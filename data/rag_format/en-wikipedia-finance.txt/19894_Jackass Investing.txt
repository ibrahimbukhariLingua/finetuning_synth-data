Jackass Investing


# Jackass Investing



***Jackass Investing: Don't do it. Profit from it.*** is a book written by Michael Dever published by Ignite LLC in 2011.

The book has also been released under the title ***Exploiting the Myths: Profiting from Wall Street's misguided beliefs.***


## Overview

*"Jackass Investing"* is an investment book that challenges conventional investment wisdom and "presents an entirely new system of thought." The book describes 20 common widely held beliefs about investing and explains why each is a myth and not a fact.

The book is based on the trading philosophy of author Michael Dever, which is based on broad strategy and market diversification. According to Dever, the definition of "Jackass Investing" is taking unnecessary risk.

The book was published in 2011, but Dever initially developed the idea for the book in 1999. He decided to write *"Jackass Investing"* to systematically refute major investment myths. He believes that most investment professionals preach similar "myths" that prohibit investors from creating truly diversified portfolios.

Dever introduces the concept of "return drivers" and explains how to use them to create trading strategies, which are the components necessary to create a truly diversified portfolio. A return driver is the core underlying reason that drives the price of a market.
