Sweden National Renewable Energy Action Plan


# Sweden National Renewable Energy Action Plan



The **Sweden National Renewable Energy Action Plan** is the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for Sweden. The plan was commissioned by the Directive 2009/28/EC which required Member States of the European Union to notify the European Commission with a road map. The report describes how Sweden planned to achieve its legally binding target of a 49% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020.


## Main targets in Sweden

In the NREAP, the Federal Government estimates the share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption to be 50.2% in 2020. The share of renewable energies in the electricity sector will thereby amount to 62.8%, the share in the heating/cooling sector will be 62%, while in the transport sector it will amount to 12.4%.


## Main incentives and laws in Sweden

The Swedish licensing and legislative system is so structured that the Swedish Parliament and the Government govern through laws and regulations that are applied by national authorities that autonomously interpret and implement these laws and regulations. At a national level, there are regional government authorities and county administrative boards that have the task of coordinating and implementing the targets and mandates stipulated by the national authorities.

**Special for Wind Power**

There are four wind power coordinators and a national network for wind power within the area of wind power. Furthermore, the Swedish Energy Agency has, on behalf of the Government, developed an Internet-based manual about wind power (Vindlov.se) for all of the information that is needed for licensing matters regarding wind power and information on most things from concept stage to the commissioning of the completed wind farm.

**Special for Solar Power**

Solar heating installations need to meet certain quality standards in order to benefit from solar heating funding.

**Financial Support Systems in Sweden**

* The Electricity certificate scheme
* Support for planning initiatives for wind power
* Governmental support for solar photovoltaic cells
* Aid for investment in solar energy
