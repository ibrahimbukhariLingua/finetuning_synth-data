## Controversy

The Czech government's official website states that she speaks English, German and Russian. However, her proficiency in English came under scrutiny in 2020 after a series of reports by Czech news outlets questioning it. Further concerns were raised by the minister's refusal to conduct interviews in English and her reported lack of participation in EU meetings conducted in the language.

At the end of January 2022, *Seznam Zprávy* reported that the Ministry of Finance had spent almost 2 million CZK on salaries and rewards for the photographer and cameraman, employees of the press department, who took Schillerová's photos and filmed her from her social media profiles. However, the Czech Republic should demand Schillerová's money back, as there might be use of public assets for personal use.
