Russian Direct Investment Fund


# Russian Direct Investment Fund



The **Russian Direct Investment Fund** (Russian: Российский фонд прямых инвестиций, **RDIF**) is Russia's sovereign wealth fund established in 2011 by the Russian government to make investments in companies of high-growth sectors of the Russian economy. Its mandate is to co-invest alongside the world's largest institutional investors, direct investment funds, sovereign wealth funds and leading companies.

RDIF's reserved capital under management equals $10 billion. RDIF has invested and committed for this purpose 2.1 trillion rubles, of which RDIF invested 200 billion rubles and 1.9 trillion rubles came from co-investors, partners and banks. RDIF also attracted over $40 billion of foreign capital into the Russian economy through long-term strategic partnerships. Kirill Dmitriev is the RDIF's chief executive officer.


## History

RDIF was founded in June 2011 under the leadership of both Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

In June 2012, RDIF and China Investment Corporation (CIC) established the Russian-Chinese Investment Fund. On 2 June 2016, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin signed Federal Law on the Russian Direct Investment Fund changing the status of RDIF. According to the law, RDIF became the sovereign wealth fund of the Russian Federation.


### Value

In June 2023 Russia claimed the fund exceeded 2.1 trillion rubles invested in the Russian economy.


### Sanctions

On 28 February 2022, as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States placed RDIF and its chief executive on its list of sanctioned Russian entities and people. The European Union, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Australia followed later in February and in March. In the recital of the sanction decision, Office of Foreign Assets Control labeled RDIF as a slush fund for Vladimir Putin and as emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy.

Restrictions also apply to parties entering investments with the Fund. The EU prohibit investment, participation, or contribution to projects co-financed by RDIF.
