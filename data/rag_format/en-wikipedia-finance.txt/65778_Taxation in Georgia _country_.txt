**Taxes in Georgia** are collected on both national and local levels. The most important taxes are collected on national level, these taxes include an income tax, corporate taxes and value added tax. On local level property taxes as well as various fees are collected.

Personal income tax in Georgia are collected at a flat rate of 20% on local-source income. Foreign-source personal income is tax-exempt. However, the definition of "foreign-source" is widely mis-represented, and further reading of the tax code reveals that income from abroad, earned through active work (on a laptop, for example) while physically present in Georgia, would be considered Georgian-source even if said income was never remitted to Georgia or derives from a foreign source.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Personal income tax for interest, dividend and royalty is 5%. There are few allowances deductible.

Value-added tax (VAT) is collected at a flat rate of 18%.There are few exceptions, nearly all goods and services are subject to VAT. Medical care, exports and education are exempt from VAT. Regardless of turnover a taxpayer have to register for VAT if it produces or imports goods. Turnovers of less than 100,000 GEL is exempt.

Corporate taxes are levied at a flat rate of 15%, which was enacted in 2008. From 2017 onward, non-distributed profits are exempt from taxation. Very few deductions are accessible. This system was set up to attract foreign investment. Furthermore, excise taxes are on some luxury and environmentally damaging goods, such as gasoline. Customs apply to some imported goods, too. Only six different taxes apply.
