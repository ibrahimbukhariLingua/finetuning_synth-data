The powerplant of Octavius Steel and Company of Bangladesh Limited in Dhaka was nationalized in the 1950s.

In 1985, Duncan Brothers established United Insurance Limited. In 1989, United Leasing Company Limited was established. In the 1980s, ASMO Subhan (Abu Syed Mohammad Obaidus Subhan) joined the company as chief executive. In 1992, it purchased Surma Valley Tea Company. It started producing Duncan mineral water in 1994 under Duncan Products Limited. It established Camellia Duncan Foundation Hospital in 1994.

The government of Bangladesh cancelled the lease of Duncan Brothers on 512 acres land which housed workers of Chandpur tea estate, established in 1890. The government planned to build a Special Economic Zone on the site which led to protests by workers living there in 2015 and 2019. This put the homes and livelihood of 15 thousand workers of Chandpur tea estate at risk.
