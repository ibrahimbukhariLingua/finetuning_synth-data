## History

On July 22, 2004, Molson, Inc. and the Adolph Coors Company announced their plan to merge. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company. The merger included the brands and brewing operations of the Molson Brewery and the Coors Brewing Company. Molson Brewery was started by John Molson in Montreal, Canada, in 1786. Coors Brewing Company was started by Adolph Coors in Golden, Colorado, United States, in 1873.

Molson Coors bought Creemore Springs Brewery on April 22, 2005.

The operations of Molson Coors in Brazil were sold to the Mexican group FEMSA in 2006, and the beer operations of FEMSA was acquired by Heineken International in 2010.


### Joint venture with SABMiller

On October 9, 2007, SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company announced a joint venture to be known as MillerCoors for their U.S. brewing and sales operations. SABMiller had 58% stake in the company, and Molson Coors had a 42% stake. MillerCoors combined their operations within North America with the headquarters in Chicago.


### European acquisitions

On February 2, 2011, the company purchased Sharp's Brewery of Cornwall in England for £20 million.

In early 2012, the company expanded into the Central and Eastern European markets by acquiring the region's market-leading brewery StarBev from CVC Capital Partners.


### Miller acquisition

In September 2015, Anheuser-Busch Inbev announced that it had reached agreement to acquire competitor SABMiller for $107 billion. During the merger discussions between the two companies in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had agreed to the proposed deal only on the basis that SABMiller "spins off all its MillerCoors holdings in the U.S. — which include both Miller- and Coors-held brands — along with its Miller brands outside the U.S."

SABMiller agreed to divest itself of the Miller brands by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. The merger between Anheuser-Busch Inbev and SABMiller closed on October 10, 2016. The spinoff deal was completed on October 11, 2016. As per the agreement with the regulators, SABMiller sold to Molson Coors full ownership of the Miller Brewing Company brand portfolio.

After SABMiller divested itself of all interests in MillerCoors, Molson Coors became the largest brewer in North America


### 2020 rebranding and restructuring

On October 30, 2019, the company announced it would change its name to Molson Coors Beverage Company as a part of a restructuring to take place in 2020. The name change would reflect the company's growing focus on beverages outside of the traditional beer and brewing offerings. Additionally, the company would retire the MillerCoors corporate brand name and reorganize its global business units into Molson Coors North America, headquartered in Toronto, and Molson Coors Europe, headquartered in Prague.



### 2020 Milwaukee campus shooting

On February 26, 2020, six people, including the shooter, were killed at a shooting near the company's Milwaukee brewing campus.
