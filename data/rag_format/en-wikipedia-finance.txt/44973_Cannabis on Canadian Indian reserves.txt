**Cannabis on Canadian Indian reserves** became legal under the Cannabis Act on October 17, 2018, subject to local restrictions. First Nations leaders have called for more local control of the cannabis economy on their reserves.


## Planning stages

In December 2016, tribal leaders discussed the impacts that legal cannabis would have during the annual Assembly of First Nations. Opinion was divided, with some chiefs calling for a delay in legalization to allow them to make plans, while others were enthused about the economic advantages they expected to come with legalization. There was, however, broad consensus that cannabis regulations on Indian reserves should be left to the members of the community, rather than default to following the province's regulations.


## Specific nations


### Oneida Nation

The Oneida Nation of the Thames, an Indigenous community in southwestern Ontario, has engaged in the cannabis industry as part of its economic development strategy. In December 2016, the Chief of the Nation announced plans to apply for a cannabis cultivation license to expand their operations. The Nation already operates a dispensary and asserts that licensing should not be required, advocating for Indigenous sovereignty over cannabis regulation on their lands. This move aligns with broader efforts among Indigenous communities in Canada to pursue economic independence and self-governance within the cannabis industry.


### Manitoba First Nations

Three nations in Manitoba, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, Long Plain First Nation, and Peguis First Nation, formed an alliance with National Access Cannabis in 2016, seeking to gain profit for their communities from legalization, and lobby for their interests on issues such as tax rebates for cannabis sold on reserves.


### Tobique First Nation

In October 2016, the medical cannabis dispensary on the Tobique First Nation reserve in New Brunswick was raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The dispensary was illegal under national law, but was approved by the band council, causing a disjunct and raising issues of tribal sovereignty. The community reacted with anger to the raid, with 50 members forming a blockade to prevent RCMP officers from leaving. The manager of the dispensary stated to news media: "Our laws, our laws... Your laws, your laws."


### Mohawk

The Mohawk Nation obtained a cannabis cultivation permit in 2018, marking its entry into the industry as part of a community-focused economic development strategy. This move allows the Nation to retain local revenue, create jobs, and fund essential services such as healthcare and education. By managing cannabis production independently, the Mohawk Nation underscores its commitment to Indigenous sovereignty, advocating for regulatory control within their territories separate from provincial or federal oversight. This effort reflects broader trends among Indigenous communities in Canada seeking self-determination through the cannabis industry
