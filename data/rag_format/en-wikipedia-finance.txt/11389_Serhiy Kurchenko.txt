He said, "Who is the true owner of Metalist? Come on, I know a little more than you think."

### VETEK group of companies

On 22 February 2013, the press-service of the group of companies "Gas Ukraine 2009" announced the formation of a new group of companies "East European Energy Company." (VETEK) consisting of two major companies LLC "VETEK" and LLC "VETEK." and others, with Kurchenko controlling the development strategy of the new group.

On 26 February 2013, the VETEK group of companies bought 99.6% of the Odesa refinery's shares from Lukoil. Despite the plant's opening ceremony on 29 March 2013 it has not been operating.ʷʰᵉⁿ?

Although the founder of UMH, Boris Lozhkin, declared that the transaction was of a commercial nature, some commentators suggested that the information field for 2015 would be cleared for the benefit of the VETEK group. The chief editor of Forbes Ukraine, Vladimir Fedorin, suspected that the sale of Forbes Ukraine would end it in its current form and that the buyer intended to silence journalists before the presidential election, to whitewash his own reputation, or use the edition to resolve the issues that do not have anything to do with the media business.

On 23 August 2013, Kurchenko met with the editors of Ukrainian Media Holding and presented a new structure named VETEK Media. Kurchenko stated, "VETEK Media is one of the directions of our business. We will continue our development in Ukraine, Russia and Europe. Today the main asset of media direction is UMH."

On 17 July 2013, Kurchenko bought 80% of the shares Brockbusinessbank VETEK. The bank's Chief of its board of directors is Boris Timonkin, and Igor Franzkevich is chairman of the board.

Forbes Media revoked the local publication license to Forbes Ukraine in August 2015.

In December 2017 Kyiv's Pechersky District Court seized corporate and intellectual rights along with part of the real estate owned by UMH holding. According to court the assets are related to the crimes committed by former president Viktor Yanukovych and are involved in misappropriation of property or embezzlement via abuse of office by an organized group, as well as money laundering.


### Corruption allegations

Media have described Kurchenko as the "wizard of gaz", the "gas king of Ukraine" and "business sensation of Ukraine 2012".ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He gives no interviews, no live comments, and makes no appearances on open business forums, releasing only prepared press releases.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

According to investigative journalists, Kurchenko's achievements in the trade of liquefied natural gas, oil products and products for the oil and gas industry resulted from his connections to high-ranking officials in the government of Ukraine, namely Artem Pshonka, the son of former Prosecutor General of Ukraine and Party of regions MP Viktor Pshonka and Oleksandr Yanukovych, the eldest son of former president Viktor Yanukovych. Further connections are Serhiy Arbuzov, first Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine and Alexander Klimenko, Ministry of Finance (Ukraine). Kurchenko has denied these connections. Dmitry Firtash's companies allegedly provided cheap gas for Kurchenko to sell.

Following the 22 February 2014 impeachment of former president Viktor Yanukovych, Kurchenko and 17 other individuals like relatives, prominent businessmen and former senior officials considered close to Yanukovich became subject of a European Union asset freeze effective 6 March 2014. Kurchenko had left Ukraine the previous month and moved to Russia; his press spokesman released a statement to the *Financial Times* saying, "I am an honest Ukrainian businessman. I am ready to provide all the necessary documents and to give any assistance to the EU inspection bodies in order to prove my innocence." Later it was revealed that he left for Russia.

He is also accused of buying liquefied gas at specialized auctions at a discounted price (allegedly to provide for the needs of the public). According to Ukrainian prosecutors this liquefied gas was then sold to Kurchenko-controlled business entities at market prices.

In December 2017 the National Police of Ukraine arrested Mikheil Saakashvili accusing him of being financed by a "criminal group" linked to Yanukovych and Kurchenko. It was claimed that this group was orchestrating a Russian government backed campaign to seize power in Ukraine.

According to Ukrainian and Russian media Kurchenko owns the coal company Vneshtorgservis in Ukraine's separatist entities Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic that emerged in the ongoing War in Donbass.
