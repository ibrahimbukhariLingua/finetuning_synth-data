**Note**: Series dates listed for United States paper money represents a specific issue or set of issues. Different series may represent minor or major design changes, or no design change (series listed on the same line). Only a variety of a president's portrait used on paper money is noted next to the series date.

Twenty-three U.S. presidents have appeared on U.S. coin and paper currency (As of March 2017ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ). By law (31 U.S.C. § 5114), "only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency".
