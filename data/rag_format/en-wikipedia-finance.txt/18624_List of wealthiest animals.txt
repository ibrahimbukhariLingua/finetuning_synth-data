# List of wealthiest animals



The **list of wealthiest animals** in the world include animals that have inherited or earned over 1 million U.S. dollars.


## Through inheritance

Non-human animals are not legal persons and cannot directly own property. Pets typically "inherit" money through a pet trust through which the money must be used for their care after the death of the owner.

## Hoaxes

* Reportedly, Toby Rimes, a poodle, inherited $20 million from New Yorker Ella Wendel in 1931. In fact, it seems that no such bequest was made.
* In 2021, the Associated Press and several other news organizations reported that a German Shepherd dog named Gunther VI inherited $400 million dollars from Countess Karlotta Leibenstein of Germany. The day after the Associated Press article, the *New York Post* published an article disputing the validity of the claim. The Associated Press later removed the article from its website and published a new article admitting the story was a fabrication. The story of Gunther was featured in the 2023 Netflix documentary series *Gunther's Millions*.
