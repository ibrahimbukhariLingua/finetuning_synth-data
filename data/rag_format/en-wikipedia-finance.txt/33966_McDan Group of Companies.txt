## Controversy

GACL in a letter dated January 28, 2022, directed McDan Aviation to suspend the commissioning ceremony following some alleged breaches.

The Ghana Airport Company, in the letter to McDan, said it had “engaged in several activities without prior approval from GACL which have typically called for emergency corrective actions.”
