**Maconomy** was a global provider of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software founded in 1989 in Denmark by Per Tejs Knudsen, Philip Dam and Ulrik Jørring. Maconomy was acquired by Deltek in 2010.


## History

Maconomy originates from the company PPU Software A/S, founded in Denmark in 1983. In 1989 PPU Software A/S defined a new strategy based on a new base technology, which was encapsulated in a subsidiary called PPU Maconomy A/S.

The Maconomy headquarters were located in Copenhagen, Denmark. Additionally, Maconomy had offices in five other countries: The Netherlands (Benelux), Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Maconomy also had offshore development operations in Kyiv, Ukraine, and an extensive partner network in Europe, UK, India, Canada, South Africa and other countries.

Maconomy completed its initial public offering (IPO) on the OMX Nordic Exchange (formerly Copenhagen Stock Exchange) in December 2000, receiving the stock symbol MACO.

On July 6, 2010, Maconomy was acquired by Deltek.
