## Biography

Greer was raised in Carlisle, Massachusetts, graduating from Concord-Carlisle High School in 1993. He received his undergraduate degree in international business from Messiah University (B.S., 1997). While traveling to Russia through Messiah’s International Business Institute, Greer was introduced to microfinance and "quickly recognized it as a perfect opportunity to combine [his] interests in business and missions."

Upon graduation, Greer spent two years in the education sector before World Relief hired him to work as a microfinance adviser in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He also served as a technical adviser for Self-Help Development Foundation (CARE Zimbabwe) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. In 1999, he became the managing director for Urwego Bank in Kigali, Rwanda, managing there for three years. Afterwards, he attended Harvard University, focusing one of his research projects on HOPE International’s work in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Greer received his graduate degree in political and economic development from Harvard’s Kennedy School (M.P.P., 2004). He also received an honorary doctorate from Erskine College (Doctor of Humane Letters, 2012). He has a nephew named Peter Greer who resides in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

In 2004, Jeff Rutt, founder of HOPE International, invited Greer to take leadership of the nonprofit. HOPE’s mission is to invest in the dreams of families in the world’s underserved communities as they proclaim and live the Gospel. They carry out their mission by providing biblically-based training, savings services, and loans that restore dignity and break the cycle of poverty. Under Greer’s leadership, HOPE has expanded from having a presence in two countries with an operating budget of $1.2 million to serving in 16 countries with an operating budget of $19 million in 2019.
