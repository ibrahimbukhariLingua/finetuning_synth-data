Mitsui & Co.


# Mitsui & Co.



**Mitsui & Co., Ltd.** (三井物産, *Mitsui Bussan*) is one of the largest *sogo shosha* (general trading companies) in Japan; it is part of the Mitsui Group.


## History

The company was established in 1876 with 16 members, including the founder, Takashi Masuda. By the end of World War II, it had become a dominant trading giant, but was dissolved by the order of GHQ.

The current Mitsui & Co. was established in 1947 as **Daiichi Bussan Kaisha, Ltd.** (*First Bussan Corporation Ltd.*). In 1959, it merged with several other trading companies and changed its name to **Mitsui & Co., Ltd.**

During Japan's period of rapid postwar economic growth, the firm was a key player in several major natural resources projects. In 1971, it took a stake in an offshore gas field near Das Island in Abu Dhabi, which supplies liquefied natural gas to Japan on an exclusive basis; it invested in a major Western Australian LNG project in 1985 and in the Sakhalin II project in 1994.

Its subsidiary Mitsui Oil Exploration's MOEX Offshore had a 10% stake in the *Deepwater Horizon* well in the Gulf of Mexico through a subsidiary, and in May 2011, MOEX agreed to pay US$1.07 billion to settle BP claims against it over the explosion and oil spill at the well. Some analysts had thought BP would realize a larger settlement from MOEX, but there was also relief to have a first step toward resolving the multiple claims.

Berkshire Hathaway acquired over 5% of the stock in the company, along with four other Japanese trading houses, over the 12-month period ending in August 2020.


## Business areas

Mitsui engages in six major business areas:

* Energy: Upstream development and trading in oil and gas, the firm's's largest line of business, accounting for over half of its consolidated EBITDA and net earnings in the first half of fiscal year 2015. Mitsui has two major energy projects in the United States, at the Marcellus Shale in the Mid-Atlantic and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas.
* Metals: Development and trading with a focus on iron ore and steel. This business accounts for about a quarter of consolidated EBITDA and net earnings. In 2014 Mitsui acquired a stake in the Moatize coal mine and Nacala rail and port development in Mozambique from the Brazilian mining company Vale.
* Chemicals: basic and performance chemicals including fertilizers, electronics materials and functional materials.
* Machinery and Infrastructure: Sells, finances and invests in large-scale plants, ships, aircraft, automobiles and other heavy machinery.
* Lifestyle: food, retail, healthcare, fashion, forestry and real estate. In 2014, CEO Masami Iijima identified this segment as an area of particular interest, particularly in relation to Mitsui's cooperation with Lippo Group in Indonesia.
* Information and Corporate Development: information technology, finance and logistics.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Criticism

Mitsui & Co. has faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia despite the country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions. The Japanese trading giant has maintained its stake in the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, citing the need to ensure energy supplies to Japan. Mitsui holds a combined 22.5% share in the project, which remains operational under Russian control following the Kremlin's restructuring. Although the company has reduced the book value of its investments due to "growing business uncertainty," it has not fully withdrawn, unlike some Western companies. Mitsui also retains a 10% share in Novatek's Arctic LNG-2 project, despite Japan freezing new investments in the initiative. Critics argue that Mitsui's continued involvement undermines the global effort to isolate Russia economically, indirectly supporting a regime responsible for ongoing war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine.
