# Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited



**BTCL** or **Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited** is the largest telecommunications company in Bangladesh. The company was founded as the **Bangladesh Telegraph & Telephone Board** (**BTTB**) following Bangladesh's independence in 1971. On 1 July 2008, the BTTB became a public limited company and was renamed as BTCL. The Bangladesh government initially owned all BTCL shares, but stated it would sell the shares to the public the following year. The estimated value of BTCL is ৳15,000 crore (৳150 billion). BTCL has a total of 12,636 officials and staff.

BTCL provides land-line telephone services in Bangladesh's urban areas, including domestic long-distance calling and international services as well as internet services. In 2004, the Bangladesh Government issued a number of PSTN licenses to private companies, but they were barred from providing services in the lucrative Dhaka market (which accounts for the majority of the nationwide market). The monopoly held by BTCL was broken when other operators started to receive licenses from 2007.

## Graft and controversy

* Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) suffered revenue loss of at least ৳2,000 crore in last six years due to corruption, revealed a TIB study 31 April 2014. Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) identified tampering with the BTCL's international call records as one of its major corrupted areas.
* Bangladesh's state-owned telecommunications company is refusing to reconnect a British firm to the country's network despite having been ordered to do so by the courts. London-based Zamir Telecom has been cut off from the Bangladesh network since March, causing it significant financial damage. Bangladesh's controversial telecoms minister, Abdul Latif Siddique, has admitted giving the order for the disconnection of Zamir Telecom from the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). This was in breach of a 2010 court order overturning a similar situation. Zamir Telecom successfully challenged BTCL in a Dhaka court in early May when judges ordered the firm's reconnection within 36 hours. But the court order was ignored again. This is purportedly because of an ongoing arbitration process between BTCL and Zamir Telecom over disputed invoicing, despite judges saying the connection must be maintained alongside the talks.
* The Anti-Corruption Commission on 25 August 2013, approved filing four cases against 22 people, including Managing Director SOM Kalim Ullah and three other former managing directors of Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited, in connection with embezzling over ৳5.75bn through illegal Voice over Internet Protocol business. ACC Commissioner M Shahabuddin said the commission had approved filing the cases at a recent meeting. "Since we have found their involvement in the graft allegation the commission has taken the decision." BTCL Managing Director SOM Kalim Ullah, former managing directors SM Khabiruzzaman, Afsar-ul-Alam and AM Abu Sayed Khan, former member (maintenance and operation) Mohammad Tawfiq, former divisional engineers Ronel Chakma and Habibur Rahman Pramanik, Ericsson Bangladesh Ltd's Contract Manager Asif Jahid, Relation Manager Nazrul Islam and engineer Masrurul Hakim will be made accused in the cases. ACC officials said the BTCL officials in connivance with Ericsson Bangladesh Ltd embezzled the money by erasing incoming international call minutes from call detail record of ITX-5 and ITX-7.
