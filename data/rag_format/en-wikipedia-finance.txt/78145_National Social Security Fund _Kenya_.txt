National Social Security Fund (Kenya)


# National Social Security Fund (Kenya)



The **National Social Security Fund** is a Kenyan government agency responsible for the collection, safekeeping, responsible investment and distribution of retirement funds of employees in both the formal and informal sectors of the Kenyan Economy. Participation for both employers and employees is compulsory. The fund is both a pension fund and provident fund.


## History

The National Social Security Fund was established in 1965 through the Act of Parliament Cap 258 of the Laws of Kenya. It initially operated as a Department of the Ministry of Labour until 1987 when the act was amended, transforming the fund into a state corporation under the management of a board of trustees. Under the National Social Security Fund Act of 2013, both employed and the self-employed and their dependents qualify as contributing members. The Act on pension requires all Kenyans that are above 18 years of age to register to the program.

The board of trustees is composed of workers' representatives through the Central Organization of Trade Unions, employers through the *Federation of Kenya Employers* and the Government of Kenya through the Ministries of Labour and Finance. This composition ensures that the board accommodates the views and aspirations of the three social partners in policy formulation and running of the organization.
