Tanzania Mercantile Exchange


# Tanzania Mercantile Exchange



**Tanzania Mercantile Exchange** is a commodity exchange in Tanzania. The commodities exchange is put in place to help various farmers access the domestic and global market better and obtain a fair price in selling of their produce. The exchange is currently undergoing training of their staff and has begun pilot trading in Sesame Seeds and Green Grams. The exchange plans to trade in coffee, cashew nuts, sesame, rice, sunflowers and maize, which are all currently traded under the warehouse receipt system. The Capital Market and Securities Authority (CMSA) currently oversees the operations of the exchange and is in the process of educating farmers to use the system, however, many farmers are skeptical to the system.

The exchange is supposed to be electronic based and floor based, however, the exchange has opted to begin with a floor based trading system to gain the trust of the small farmers. Many farmers, especially coffee farmers are used to the electronic auction system at the Moshi Coffee Exchange. The TMX and the Coffee board of Tanzania is looking integrate their platforms to create a single window system.
