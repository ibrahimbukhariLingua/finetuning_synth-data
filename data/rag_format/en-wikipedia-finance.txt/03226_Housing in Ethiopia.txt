## Condominium housing

In 2005, Ethiopia initiated condominium allotment for people who are in low-and middle-income people to create job opportunities and promotes enterprises. The first pilot condominium testing began in Addis Ababa at Bole sub-city between the year 2003 and 2005. In later years, the government borrowed funds from Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and constructed subsidized condominium houses in Addis Ababa and selected towns.

This was followed by finance and land supply, capacity building, bulk purchase of industrial products and construction materials, organized medium, small enterprises, standardizing housing, and introducing new construction technology that minimize cost and time. The government firstly aimed for people with low- and -middle income and then to economize urban land through empty open space and renewing decayed areas and vertical increment of units by constructing G+2 to G+4 condominium houses. The third phase was to provide ideal cost and the fourth was to reduce poverty and unemployment for people.

However such reforms have been viewed by some authors "trading privacy for location". Between 2004 and 2011, 453,287 people were registered in Addis Ababa; the number of people who registered for two and three bedrooms were 102,287 (23%), 20,1969 (44%), 11,8241 (26%) and 30,790 (7%) respectively. According project plan of housing development office, 50,000 units were constructed to fulfill 453,287 demands within seven years, but only 80,287 were supposed to be constructed within one or one and half year. Nevertheless, 17.7% demands were met and additional 372,460 demand would be met for the next 32 years.

There was also high deficit due to probable low supply of houses. For example, one bedroom units have 171,602 deficit. This means 171,602 are pending without response during the six round of distribution and the third phase of construction. Within Bole sub city alone, Japan Embassy, International Stadium, Adwa Park, and Bole ring road, there were 26, 65, 15, 31, 3, 6, and 1 vacant unit respectively.


## Housing affordability in Ethiopian context

In Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), affordable housing is typically measured to the proportional housing population expenditure that does not exceed 30% of disposable income (over 40% is deemed a burden by the OECD). In Ethiopian context, affordable housing relatively appeared at the first glance on expenditure on "housing (rent), water, electricity and gas" accounting around 19% of annual expenditure for households across all consumption quintiles.

However, the Ethiopian context is different so far by further scrutiny, which regard of expenditure category. For instance, according to OECD, 14% housing expenditure on average is on "food and non-alcoholic beverages", more than 54% of total expenditure for fully 80%.
