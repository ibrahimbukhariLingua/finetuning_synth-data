**Des Dearlove** (born 1963) is a British business journalist and management theorist, known for his work on the history and state-of-the-art of management theory.

An internationally recognized expert and commentator on management thinking, for over two decades Dearlove has championed the leading management ideas through Thinkers50, the first global ranking of management thinkers, which he co-founded in 2001 with Stuart Crainer.

Thinkers50 is a mission-drive organization which aims to be the world’s most reliable resource for identifying, ranking, and sharing the leading management and business ideas of our age: ideas that can make a real difference in the world.

Dearlove has taught at leading business schools, including IE Business School, and the Said Business School at Oxford University, where he is an associate fellow. He is an adjunct professor at IE Business School.

Under the pen name of D.D. Everest, Dearlove is also the author of the Archie Greene trilogy of children’s books (Faber & Faber). In 2014, *Archie Greene and the Magician’s Secret* was shortlisted for the National Book Awards.
