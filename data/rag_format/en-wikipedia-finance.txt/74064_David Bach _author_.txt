Bach's "Latte Factor" is the idea that the "small amounts of money you spend can add up to a fortune". He trademarked the phrase, and it was included in the *Oxford Dictionary* in 2003.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Bach suggested that by foregoing a Starbucks latte every day, a person could retire as a millionaire. In 2012, journalist Helaine Olen criticised this calculation for its assumptions that a person would be ordering both a latte and a biscotti 365 days a year, as well as receiving high investment returns and ignoring inflation and taxes.
