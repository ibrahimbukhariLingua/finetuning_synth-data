Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Houston Branch


# Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Houston Branch



The **Reserve Bank of Dallas Houston Branch** is one of three branches of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
The branch is located on Allen Parkway in the Fourth Ward of Houston, Texas. The 297,000-square-foot (27,600 m²) building, which includes the second largest currency vault in the country, was designed by architect Michael Graves.


## Structure

The building's architect Michael Graves said the inspiration for the structure was the Southwestern landscape. Musician and Talking Heads leader David Byrne, commented that "This very out of place structure somehow lingers, like a fart left by someone no longer in an elevator." The brick exterior, which consists of 537,000 closure brick, 31,400 blue structural glazed tile, and 90,000 modular accent brick has been called a masonry masterpiece by the Mason Contractors Association of America.
