## History

On 31 May 1999, Terna was established within the Enel Group, by way of implementation of Italian Legislative Decree No. 79/99 which within the context of the process for the deregulation of the Italian electricity sector, sanctioned the separation between ownership and management of the national transmission grid.

On 23 June 2004, following the Prime Minister's Decree issued on 11 May of the same year, Terna was put on sale with an IPO on Borsa Italiana.

In 2010 Terna joined Desertec, a project aimed at producing and transmitting renewable energy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to meet local needs and be assigned in part to the European interconnected grid.

In 2011, Terna Group adopted a new organizational structure. Through Terna Rete Italia safely manages the Italian electricity system with more than 63,500 kilometers of high voltage lines. Through Terna Plus manages new business opportunities and non-traditional activities, in Italy and abroad.

2011 was the 7th consecutive year of growth for the Group. A dividend of €21 was paid per share.
The 2011 results were submitted by the CEO Flavio Cattaneo during the Terna Board of Administration meeting held to approve the Strategic Plan 2012–2016.

In 2012, Terna consolidated Revenues stood at 1,806 million euros, +10.4% compared to 2011, mainly due to the Grid Transmission Fee and to the results from Non Traditional Activities carried out by the Group.

On 31 January 2012, Terna presented the Development Plan of the National Electricity Transmission Grid for the decade 2012–2021. The plan is drafted and updated every year and, in 2012, it included investments for over 7 billion euro aimed at increasing efficiency for the electricity system, including the reduction of energy losses and the reduction of CO₂ emissions.

In 2013, Terna consolidated Revenues stood at 1,896 million euros, with an increase of 90.5 million euros (+5%) compared to 2012. Ebitda stood at 1,281 million euros (+6,5%), Group Net income at 514 million euro (+10,8%).
