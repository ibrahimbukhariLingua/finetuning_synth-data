Definitions of economics


# Definitions of economics



Various **definitions of economics** have been proposed, including attempts to define precisely "what economists do".


## Etymology

The term *economics* was originally known as "political economy". This term evolved from the French Mercantilist usage of *Ã©conomie politique*, which expanded the notion of economy from the ancient Greek concept of household management to the national level, as the public administration of state affairs.


## Definitions


### James Steuart

James Stuart (1767) authored the first book in English with 'political economy' in its title, explaining it just as:

The title page listed subjects including "population, agriculture, trade, industry, money, coins, interest, circulation, banks, exchange, public credit, and taxes".


### J.B. Say

In 1803, J.B. Say distinguished the subject from its public-policy uses, defining it as the science *of* the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth. On the satirical side, Thomas Carlyle (1849) coined 'the dismal science' as an epithet for classical economics, a term often linked to the pessimistic analysis of Malthus (1798). John Stuart Mill (1844) defined the subject in a social context as:

The shift from the social to the individual level appears within the main works of the Marginal Revolution. Carl Menger's definition reflects the focus on the economizing man:


### William Stanley Jevons

William Stanley Jevons, another very influential author of the Marginal Revolution defines economics as highlighting the hedonic and quantitative aspects of the science:


### Alfred Marshall

Alfred Marshall provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook *Principles of Economics* (1890) that extends analysis beyond wealth and from the societal to the microeconomic level, creating a certain synthesis of the views of those still more sympathetic with the classical political economy (with social wealth focus) and those early adopters of the views expressed in the Marginal Revolution (with individual needs focus).
His inclusion of the expression wellbeing was also very significant to the discussion on the nature of economics:


### Lionel Robbins

Lionel Robbins (1932) developed implications of what has been termed "perhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject":

Robbins describes the definition as not *classificatory* in "pick[ing] out certain *kinds* of behaviour" but rather *analytical* in "focus[ing] attention on a particular *aspect* of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity".

Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and rational-choice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields. There are other criticisms as well, such as in scarcity not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment.


### Gary Becker

Gary Becker, a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, describes the approach he favours as "combining the assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable preferences, and market equilibrium, used relentlessly and unflinchingly". One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the "choice process and the type of social interaction that such analysis involves".


### John Neville Keynes

John Neville Keynes regarded the discussion leading up to the definition of economics more important than the definition itself. It would be a way to reveal the scope, direction and troubles the science faces.

A recent review of economics definitions includes a range of those in principles textbooks, such as descriptions of the subject as the study of:

* the 'economy'
* the coordination process
* the effects of scarcity
* the science of choice
* human behaviour
* human beings as to how they coordinate wants and desires, given the decision-making mechanisms, social customs, and political realities of society

It concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.
