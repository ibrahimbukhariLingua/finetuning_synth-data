British Retail Consortium


# British Retail Consortium



The **British Retail Consortium** (or **BRC**) is a trade association for retail businesses in the United Kingdom.


## History

The British Retail Consortium was formed in January 1992 with the merger of the British Retailers' Association and the Retail Consortium. In 1998, it produced the first edition of the BRC Food Technical Standard and Protocol for food suppliers. This has been widely adopted, not just throughout the UK but around the world.

BRC went on to produce other global standards, which became a separate brand and were sold to the LGC Group in 2016.


## Functions

It campaigns for the retail industry and is the authoritative voice of retail, recognized for its powerful campaigning and influence within government and as a provider of in-depth retail information. The BRC leads the industry and works with its members to tell the story of retail, shape debates, and influence issues and opportunities that will help make a positive difference. Their work represents the careers of people who work in the industry, the communities retail touches, and competitiveness as a fundamental principle of the industry’s success.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
