Borders (retailer)


# Borders (retailer)



**Borders** is a book and stationery retailer operating in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates by the Al Maya Group. It was founded in the United States in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders, who opened their first bookshop in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

In October 1992, it was purchased by Kmart, but then spun-off in 1995 as **Borders Group, Inc.** and remained headquartered in Ann Arbor, with Waldenbooks as its subsidiary. In 1997, Borders expanded into Singapore, and then later expanded into Australia and New Zealand. In 1998, Borders expanded into the United Kingdom, and then later into Ireland. In 2005, it opened in Malaysia, and in 2006, with Al Maya Group, it opened a location in the United Arab Emirates, and then further expanded across the Middle East.

In September 2007, Risk Capital Partners purchased the Borders stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland, alongside a license to use the Borders name. In June 2008, REDgroup Retail purchased the Borders stores in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand with a license to the Borders name.

In November 2009, Borders in the United Kingdom and Ireland collapsed into administration, with all stores closed by the end of the year, resulting in around 1,150 job losses. In June 2011, Borders closed in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand after its franchisor went into administration. In July 2011, Borders in the United States was liquidated after failing to find a buyer. It employed about 19,500 people throughout America, including at its Waldenbooks stores. Its final U.S. stores closed down in September 2011.

In September 2011, its longtime rival Barnes & Noble acquired the Borders trademark and other intellectual property assets. The Malaysian and Middle East Borders operations continued to trade under renewed franchise deals with Barnes & Noble, as well as a failed attempt in 2013 to re-establish the brand in Singapore. In 2015, Al Maya Group purchased the regional Borders trademark rights outright from Barnes & Noble, and subsequently diversified it into a merchandise mix consisting of books, toys and stationery. The Malaysian Borders franchises closed down in July 2023.


## History

The original Borders bookstore was located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, where it was founded in 1971 by brothers Tom and Louis Borders during their undergraduate and graduate years at the University of Michigan. The first Borders bookshop opened at 209 South State Street, Ann Arbor, in 1971.

In 1975, they bought out the stock of Wahr's, an 80-year-old bookstore that was ending business at 316 South State Street, and hired Michael Hildebrand and Harvey James Robin to stock it with rare books and manage the old shop. Hildebrand had managed Gibson's used and rare book department in East Lansing for years and Harvey Robin had been a local restorer of rare books, who moved his bindery upstairs. Wahr's had been mainly a textbook and school supplies vendor, but the brothers did not deal in textbooks. They moved the retail bookshop to much larger quarters that had become available down the street at 303 South State, in the former location of the Wagner and Son men's clothing store. The old shop was renamed Charing Cross Bookshop and Tom Frick was sent over from the new bookshop to help.

In 1985, the company opened its second location, in Beverly Hills, Michigan.

The downtown Ann Arbor store moved across the street again in 1994 to 612 East Liberty Street, at the southwest corner of Liberty and State Streets, in the building once occupied by the defunct Jacobson's Department Store. Although not the original location, it was identified as "Borders #1" because it was the flagship store.

Former Hickory Farms president Robert F. DiRomualdo was hired in 1989 to expand the company.


### Kmart and Waldenbooks

Borders was acquired in 1992 by Kmart, which had acquired mall-based book chain Waldenbooks eight years earlier. Kmart had struggled with the book division, having first tinkered with the assortment and later with discounting. In the Borders acquisition, Kmart merged the two companies in hopes that the experienced Borders senior management could bail out floundering Waldenbooks.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Instead, many of the Borders senior management team left the company, leaving behind an even larger and more unwieldy division for Kmart executives to handle on the heels of aggressive expansions by rivals Barnes & Noble and Crown Books. Facing its own fiscal problems and intense pressure from stockholders, Kmart spun off Borders in 1995, in a highly structured stock-purchase plan. The newly formed company was initially called Borders-Walden Group and, by the end of the same year, renamed simply Borders Group.

In 1994, Borders briefly operated a mall-based toy store called All Wound Up, which sold toys and novelty items. Most All Wound Up stores were seasonal kiosks in shopping malls.

Borders was rumoured to open stores in Canada, starting with a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m²) retail store in Toronto. However, this was rejected for failing to meet Canadian ownership regulations for book retailers.

At one point, the highest-grossing location in US territory was a remodeled and expanded store in Puerto Rico, generating $17 million in sales annually. Another notably large and successful location in the U.S. was located at 5 World Trade Center in New York City, but the store sustained damage and was closed following the September 11 attacks.


### Changes in business plan

In 1998, Philip Pfeffer succeeded Robert DiRomualdo as chief executive.

In 2003, Borders had 1,249 stores using the Borders and Waldenbooks names.

In 2004, Borders reached an agreement with Starbucks subsidiary Seattle's Best Coffee to operate cafes in its domestic superstores under the Seattle's Best brand name.

In March 2007, Borders Group announced it would scale down the number of Waldenbooks outlets it had by half, to about 300, in the next year.

In 2008, Borders opened 14 concept stores nationwide, which included a Digital Center, offering select electronic devices such as MP3 players, digital photo frames, and the Sony Reader. The concept stores were located in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Denver, Colorado; Las Vegas, Nevada; Panama City Beach, Florida; Noblesville, Indiana; Monroeville, Pennsylvania; and Alameda, California. The latest Borders Digital Center opened in Alameda in January 2008.

In late 2007, Borders installed digital video monitors in select stores. The monitors displayed special programs, as well as news, sports, and financial information provided through Ripple Networks, Inc., a California-based marketing service.

Borders Group also launched a customer appreciation program called Borders Rewards. In contrast to a membership from Barnes & Noble, which was a paid-for membership that entitled customers to discounts, Borders Rewards was a free program with discount coupons and the ability to earn store credit for purchases. In addition, in September 2009, following the lead of Barnes & Noble, the chain discontinued its fee-based wireless service provided by T-Mobile and began implementing a free Wi-Fi network provided by Verizon.


### Declining profits

The last year that Borders made a profit was in 2006. Its yearly income dropped by $1 billion over the next four years.

In March 2007, the company announced the end of its marketing alliance with Amazon begun six years earlier, as well as plans to launch its own online business in early 2008.

In March 2008, Borders Group announced the intention to sell the chain because of financial difficulties. Borders Books was rumored to have approached Barnes & Noble in hopes of a buyout. The chain was in debt, having increased its financial instability by borrowing US$42.5 million in March from Pershing Square Capital Management, the company's major stockholder, to keep the company running through the remainder of the fiscal year. The loan was said to have a very high interest rate of 12.5%, which meant that the chain would have to post a significant profit to stay afloat in the future. Following the announcement of the loan, Borders's shares dropped 28.6% to $5.07/share. The shares continued to drop throughout the year, and as of December 11, 2009, Borders stocks were trading at $1.30 on the NYSE, which was up almost a point from a low of $0.530 on January 28, 2009.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On January 5, 2009, the company announced that Ron Marshall would immediately take over as chief executive. Former CEO George L. Jones received a severance package of $2.09 million. Mark Bierley was also promoted to chief financial officer, replacing Ed Wilhelm. The changes in management were due to Borders's holiday sales having fallen by 11.7% to $868.8 million. On January 13, Mick McGuire, a former partner at Pershing Square, became chairman of the board of directors.

On March 30, 2009, Marshall announced that the loan from Pershing Square would be extended for another year (coming due on April 1, 2010), at an interest rate of 9.8%. This, combined with a series of layoffs and new promotional deals with major publishers, caused Borders stock to rise. Within a week, it had topped the $1.00 mark. By mid-April, it had approached $2.00. As a result, the company cancelled plans to ask its shareholders for permission to perform a reverse stock split.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On August 11, 2009, Borders revealed the names of the replacements for five of the eight members of the board of directors, who had previously announced their intentions to quit. The new members included Paul J. Brown of Hilton Hotels, Timothy V. Wolf of MillerCoors, and Dan Rose of Facebook.

On November 5, 2009, Borders announced that it would close some of its Waldenbooks stores in an effort to improve the profitability of its Specialty Retail operations. By January 2010, 182 stores had been closed.

Holiday sales figures for 2009 were "disappointing", with total sales of $846.8 million, (~$1.17 billion in 2023) down 14.7% from the previous year. Employees reported that major cuts were made in payroll hours.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

At the beginning of 2010, the company operated 511 Borders superstores in the United States. The company also operated 175 stores in the Waldenbooks Specialty Retail segment, including Waldenbooks, Borders Express, Borders airport stores, and Borders Outlet stores.

On January 26, 2010, CEO Ron Marshall resigned to become president and CEO of The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (A&P). Following his announcement, Borders stock fell below one dollar per share. During his tenure at Borders, all of the top executive officers resigned (or were encouraged to leave), including some who had been with the company for over 20 years. Mike Edwards (vice president and chief merchandising officer) was appointed interim CEO.

On March 31, 2010, Borders announced that the loan from Pershing Square had been paid in full. In early April, the company's stock had rebounded to $2.78 per share.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On May 21, 2010, it was revealed that Bennett S. LeBow, chairman of Vector Group, was making a large private investment in Borders stock. As a result, both LeBow and Howard Lorber, president and CEO of Vector Group, joined the board of directors. Following the resignation of chairman Mick McGuire, LeBow was elected chairman of the board. On June 3, LeBow became CEO of Borders Group. Mike Edwards was confirmed as president of Borders Group and CEO of Borders, Inc., the company's principal subsidiary.

The company reported significant losses for the third quarter, compared to 2009. At the end of 2010, *Business Week* and BBC News reported that Borders would be delaying its payments to publishers for inventory already received, to preserve liquidity. This was prompted by problems in refinancing its credit facilities.


### Bankruptcy and liquidation

On February 16, 2011, the company announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing $1.275 billion in assets and $1.293 billion in debts in its filing. The company also announced the liquidation and closing of 226 stores. Two private-equity firms, The Gores Group and Najafi Companies, expressed interest in purchasing half of the remaining Borders Group stores.

Despite a purchase offer from the private equity firm Najafi Companies, Borders was not able to find a buyer acceptable to its creditors before its July bidding deadline, so it began liquidating its remaining 399 retail outlets, with the last remaining stores closing in September.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The Chapter 11 case was ultimately converted to Chapter 7. Rival bookseller Barnes & Noble acquired Borders's trademarks and customer list.

Borders Group announced on July 1, 2011, that it had found a bidder, Direct Brands, that would acquire the assets for $215 million and the assumption of $220 million in debt.

A group of Borders creditors rejected the Direct Brands takeover bid in July 2011. Borders filed for an auction and the motion was approved by a judge; however, the bid deadline expired on July 17 without a bidder. A United States bankruptcy judge approved a petition to liquidate; this resulted in the company converting their Chapter 11 case to Chapter 7. On July 22, 2011, Borders started closing its remaining 399 stores with a phased roll-out. Business operations ceased in September 2011. Former rival and the current second-largest chain of bookstores in the United States, Books-A-Million, had made a bid to acquire 30 to 35 stores and their assets on July 19, 2011, the day liquidation was approved by the courts. However, the two sides were unable to come to an agreement suitable to all parties.

Books-A-Million later resurrected its offer to buy portions of Borders Group, purchasing the leases for 21 stores primarily in New England and Pennsylvania.
Borders USA closed its remaining stores on Sunday, September 18, 2011.

The Borders online store closed on September 27, 2011, at 10:30 pm Eastern.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ A banner then appeared on their website allowing users to browse, but directed them to Barnes & Noble to complete their purchases. All Borders customers had until October 29, 2011, to prevent their personal contact and purchase information from being transferred to Barnes & Noble. On October 1, 2011, Borders cardholders were informed by email: "As part of Borders ceasing operations, we Barnes & Noble acquired some of its assets including Borders brand trademarks and their customer list." The federal bankruptcy court approved this sale on September 26, 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## International operations


### Malaysia (defunct)

In April 2005, Borders Group opened its first franchise store with Malaysia's Berjaya Books Sdn. Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. It was located in Berjaya Times Square, which is the world's biggest mall built in a single phase, with 7.5 million square feet (700,000 m²). The store in Berjaya Times Square was advertised as being the world's biggest Borders at 60,000 square feet (5,600 m²); however, this changed with the closure of one level of the store. Borders's second store in Malaysia was located in The Curve, Mutiara Damansara. The third Borders store opened in Queensbay Mall, Penang on December 7, 2006 and closed on 26th December 2019.


### Middle East (present)

Borders opened a franchise store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai, UAE in October 2006. Despite financial difficulties in the domestic market, Borders continued to expand its franchises, adding stores in Oman and Sharjah.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

By the end of 2009, all of Borders's directly owned overseas locations had been sold or closed, leaving only the franchise stores in Dubai and Oman.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

However, international Borders stores are still operating in Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. These Borders stores are now under different ownership from the original Borders Group, and were unaffected by their store closures. In Dubai, Al Maya Group purchased lifetime rights to the Borders brand in the Middle East in 2015, and subsequently diversified it into a merchandise mix consisting of books, toys and stationery.


### Singapore, Australia and New Zealand (defunct)

In 1997, the company established its first international store in Singapore, occupying 32,000 square feet (3,000 m²) in Wheelock Place, Orchard Road, which was then the largest bookstore there.

In the third quarter of 2006, the Singapore store emerged as the best performing among the group's 559 outlets, with the highest revenue generated per square meter.

To pay off debt, Borders sold all of its Australian, New Zealand and Singaporean stores to Pacific Equity Partners (owner of competitor Angus & Robertson) in 2008. A new company called REDgroup Retail was formed. After this transaction, the Borders stores in the US, the UK (which had also been sold off to another company but closed down in 2009 due to entering administration) and the Asia/Pacific region were owned by three wholly independent entities.

In late July 2012, Pearson Australia Group decided to re-brand the former Borders website as Bookworld.
Chief Executive James Webber told The Australian "The Borders brand had lost its former sheen. We just believe the Borders brand has had its day. There are no stores left and globally it's been in demise so we believe there's an opportunity to revitalise (the franchise) and move it forward."

All of its existing customer base was migrated over to the new Bookworld website. The Bookworld brand was itself also later rebranded as Angus & Robertson.

The Australian, New Zealand, and Singaporean stores were sold in June 2008 to Pacific Equity Partners (who also own local competitor Angus & Robertson), which then formed a new company, RedGroup Retail, to pay off debt.

Borders Group also formerly operated stores in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. However, these were sold off to Pacific Equity Partners (which owned rival Angus & Robertson) in 2008, then were later sold again to REDgroup Retail. The stores continued to operate under the Borders brand as the unaffiliated "Borders Asia Pacific" until RedGroup was placed into voluntary administration in February 2011; with the five New Zealand stores sold to the James Pascoe Group and the Australian stores gradually shut down, with the last group closing in July 2011.

On 6 April, RedGroup Retail announced that 16 of the 25 remaining Borders stores in Australia were to close within two months. The handling of the administration prompted 25 franchised Angus & Robertson stores to sever ties with RedGroup, rebranding themselves as independents. By the end of May, 70 of the 87 RedGroup-owned bookstores in New Zealand had been sold off: ten airport-based Whitcoulls stores to Australian-based LS Travel Retail Pacific, and another 57 Whitcoulls plus five Borders stores to the James Pascoe Group.

On 17 February 2011, REDgroup Retail (including the Borders, Angus & Robertson as well as Whitcoulls chains) were placed into voluntary administration with Ferrier Hodgson appointed as administrators. The immediate aftermath of the announcement saw the closure of 48 Angus & Robertson stores and one Borders store. The day after the announcement, customers of the surviving stores were informed that gift vouchers could only be redeemed if they also spent an equivalent amount in cash. After 3 April, unused vouchers became void.

On 2 June 2011, the administrator announced the closure of the remaining nine Borders stores, as no buyer could be found. All stores in Australia were closed by July 2011.

The flagship Borders store at Wheelock Place in Singapore was suddenly closed on 16 August 2011, and was forced to clear out by 23 August 2011. Vouchers and gift cards from Borders Singapore bookstore were no longer accepted. After hearing that the Borders store at Wheelock Place was shutting down, some people tried to use their vouchers on the Saturday at its other outlet at Parkway Parade, but they were not allowed to do so. The books were cleared at a sale held at Singapore Expo Hall 4B, from 10am to 10pm, from 2 September 2011 to 6 September 2011. The remaining store closed on 26 September 2011 at 9 p.m., ending 14 years of sales in Singapore, just before the lease was due to end in October, but not before discounts of 70% to clear all items which started three days before its closure. On the last hours of its business in Singapore, shelves, signs, baskets and computers at the cashiers' counters were also available for sale.


#### Stores

In total Borders had 33 stores located across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. All were closed due to the demise of the parent company REDgroup Retail.

The last remaining Singaporean Borders store in Parkway Parade Shopping Center, closed its doors at 9 pm (Singapore time) after a final sale on Monday, September 26, 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Borders brand in Singapore was purchased by Popular Holdings in late 2012. In an attempt to revive the brand, a single Borders store opened in Westgate for a trial period in 2013, but that store was shortly after converted to a regular Popular book store.


### United Kingdom and Ireland (defunct)

In the United Kingdom, Borders bought 35 Books etc. stores from Philip and Richard Joseph.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1998, Borders (UK) Ltd. was established as a Borders Group subsidiary and with its Borders and Books etc. After quickly becoming one of the country's leading booksellers, due to the fierce competition in the UK marketplace, a number of the Books etc. stores closed, and Borders (UK) Ltd. was sold in 2007 to a private-equity investor.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The chain won numerous awards including Bookselling Chain of the Year 2005 & 2006, Chain Bookselling Company of the Year 2006 & 2007, Hachette Children's Retailer of the Year 2007, Magazine Destination Retailer of the Year 2007 and Usborne Children's Bookseller of the Year 2008

In March 2007, Borders Group announced the disposal of its Ireland and UK businesses, including its Books etc. business in the UK, with the aim of revitalizing the core US business; however, it was also announced that Borders Group would retain the Paperchase stationery business. International expansion would be likely to continue via franchising.

A typical Borders shop in the UK contained both a Paperchase stationery and Starbucks cafe concession. In addition, some branches also contained a RED5 gadget concession and GAME video games concession.

In September 2007, Borders (UK) Ltd. was acquired by Luke Johnson's London-based private equity investor Risk Capital Partners in a deal purportedly worth £20 million. Bookshop Acquisitions Ltd. - a subsidiary of Risk Capital Partners - was specifically set up for the purchase, and the deal included the right to use the Borders and Books etc. brand names consistent with the brand. Under the deal, Borders would receive an equity interest of about 17% in Bookshop Acquisitions. It was announced that the 42 Borders and 28 Books etc. stores in Ireland and the UK had been sold to private-equity group Risk Capital Partners for an initial £20 million. However, after changing hands in 2009, Borders in Ireland and the UK went into administration on November 26, 2009.

David Roche stepped down as CEO of Borders (UK) in January 2008, and was replaced by the chain's former managing director, Philip Downer. Upon his appointment, Downer called for a category review of the entire company, although he made it clear there were no immediate plans to further change the structure of the business.

Subsequently, it was announced in March 2008 that Borders (UK) planned to close its distribution centre (based in Cornwall) on 29 August, in favour of having publishers and wholesalers deliver directly to its shops, this being exactly opposite to the decision of competitor Waterstones, which planned to test and open its own distribution centre, colloquially referred to as 'The Hub', from the end of May.

In July 2008, Borders launched an e-commerce website. In a bid to try to take back a share of internet sales of books, the beta testing of its new transactional website commenced, due for full completion before the end of the month. As of May 2022, Books Etc. still operates as an independent family-run online business.

Borders sold eight London Books Etc. shops to Waterstones in August 2008, for an undisclosed sum.

Five Borders shops in Oxford Street, Llantrisant, Blanchardstown, Swindon and London Colney were closed in July 2009 and replaced by New Look. After July 2009, Borders was owned by Valco Capital Partners, part of Hilco, which specialises in distressed retailers.

At the end of September 2009, it was announced that the majority of the remaining Books Etc., and the two Borders Express shops, would be sold, and closing down sales began shortly after.


#### Administration

The company announced in November 2009 that it was looking for a buyer for the business following concerns that it would run out of money. The following day the Borders website stopped taking orders for books, while orders for CDs and DVDs through the Borders Entertainment website continued, for this was run by The Hut Group.

On 26 November 2009, Reuters announced that Borders (UK) had entered administration, after reportedly having difficulties raising enough cash to trade through the key Christmas period. This article was soon withdrawn, and replaced with a corrected item reporting that the company was 'mulling' administration. This news came on top of a difficult few weeks for the company, with the company reported to be on credit stop with all the major publishers, and (following the breakdown of negotiations with WHSmith) still searching for a buyer.

Later that day, Borders (UK) Ltd officially went into administration. Initially the intention was to appoint BDO as administrators, but it developed that a conflict of interest existed. Instead, MCR was appointed by Borders' owners—Valco Capital Partners, part of Hilco—as administrators. The BBC adds that MCR 'hired specialist liquidators Hilco to advise'. A 'parallel strategy' was applied of seeking a buyer for the chain as a going interest, and running closing-down sales.

On the evening of 27 November 2009, it was announced that a closing-down sale would commence in all stores on the following day. During the sales, sale stock included Denby China, a separate concern bought out by Valco Capital Partners earlier in 2009. The publisher Hachette successfully took MCR to court for continuing to sell Hachette titles without first obtaining permission, obtaining a High Court judgement on 18 December 2009 that MCR was 'incorrect' to do so.

MCR, the administrator for the chain, stated the intention of seeking a buyer. However, it was reported that a 'serious attempt' by Richard Joseph, co-founder of the Books Etc. chain, to buy a number of stores was rejected by MCR. A spokesman for MCR confirmed that unsuccessful bids had been made which had failed to meet expectations. MCR announced that the 45 stores would cease trading and close their doors permanently on 22 December, claiming that it had not been possible to sell the chain as a going concern. All staff members were made redundant on 24 December 2009. The company Borders (UK) Limited was dissolved in August 2011.

On November 26, 2009, Borders (UK) Ltd was placed into administration, which is the equivalent to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. At that time, the Borders bookshop chain in the UK started a closing down sale in all of its 45 stores. On December 14, Borders UK converted to liquidation (which is equivalent to Chapter 7 in the US) and announced it was going out of business. All UK stores were closed by the end of the year.

By the end of December 2009, Borders employed an estimated 1,150 staff across its UK stores, which went into bankruptcy administration before the end of 2009. After failing to find a buyer, all the stores were shut on December 22, 2009.

The BOOKS etc. name and its website and the Borders database were bought by Capital Books Ltd in January 2010. As of May 2022, Books Etc. still operates as an independent family-run online business. The logo contained both the Books etc. logo and the Borders logo to reflect the fact that Borders (UK) operated two different brands.


## eBook store

On July 7, 2010, Borders opened an eBook store to allow books to be directly downloaded to an e-reader device or a Borders eReader app for the desktop, iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, or Android. Although branded as a Borders store, it was actually handled by Kobo, Inc.

On June 3, 2011, the Borders eReader apps were changed to Kobo eReader apps and users could transfer their Borders eBooks to their Kobo library.
