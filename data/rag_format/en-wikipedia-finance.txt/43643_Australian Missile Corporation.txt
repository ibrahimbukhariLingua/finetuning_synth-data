Australian Missile Corporation


# Australian Missile Corporation



**The Australian Missile Corporation** (AMC) is an Australian company specialising in guided and non-guided weapon systems, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Queensland-based Defence Prime Contractor NIOA. It was contracted by the Australian Government as Enterprise Partner to help enable the development of Australia's domestic guided and non-guided weapons capability. Its inaugural and current chief executive officer, Lee Goddard, is a retired Rear Admiral of the Royal Australian Navy.

As part of a 2021 initiative, headed by the Federal Department of Defence, the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise ("GWEO") program is intended to facilitate an Australian domestic missile manufacturing capacity. It is also supported by Aurecon as Enterprise Partner and multinational arms companies Lockheed Martin and Raytheon as Strategic Partners.

GWEO was established under the Prime Ministership of Scott Morrison, whose messaging throughout his career not irregularly touched on the importance of Australia's defence infrastructure and capabilities. A RAND Corporation analysis from 2022 notes the creation of the GWEO was prefaced in the 2020 Defence Strategic Update.
