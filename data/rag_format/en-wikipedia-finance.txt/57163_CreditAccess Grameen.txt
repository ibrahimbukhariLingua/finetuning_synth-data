## History

CreditAccess Grameen (CA Grameen) was established in 1999 by Vinatha M. Reddy, who was inspired by the book “Give Us Credit” by Alex Counts, President & CEO of Grameen Foundation USA. Reddy, who was then running an NGO — "T Muniswammapa Trust", managed to obtain a US$35,000 grant from the Grameen Foundation to create a replica in India. As a result, Grameen Koota was born, and as the concept grew in popularity, the company was renamed Grameen Financial Services Private Limited in October 2007. Since then, the former owners have made way for new promoters, including CreditAccess India B.V., a Dutch-based Asia-focused microfinance major that has invested INR 968 crore in CA Grameen since 2009.
