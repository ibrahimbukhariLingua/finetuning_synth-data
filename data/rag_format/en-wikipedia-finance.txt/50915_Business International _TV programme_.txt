Business International (TV programme)


# Business International (TV programme)



***Business International*** was a news television programme which aired on CNN International. It was anchored alternately by Adrian Finighan and Becky Anderson from CNN's London studios.

*Business International* was launched in 2001, initially as a twice-daily show co-presented by Becky Anderson and Richard Quest. As the title implies, it covered international business news. During the programme, market reports would come from the London Stock Exchange. However, in later years, the programme devoted more air time to breaking world news.

Between 2002 and 2004, the edition broadcast at 08:00 UK time was branded as *Business Central* and was presented by Richard Quest. This programme focused on financial news from Europe and Asia, and covered the opening of European financial markets.

The European evening edition of the programme, presented by Anderson, also had sports updates and a preview of the following day's newspaper headlines.
