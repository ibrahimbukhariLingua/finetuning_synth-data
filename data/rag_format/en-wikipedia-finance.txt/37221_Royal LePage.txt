## History

Albert Edward (A.E.) LePage established his real estate company ‘A.E. LePage – The Bungalow Specialist’ on July 2, 1913.

In 1920, A.E. LePage assisted in founding the Toronto Real Estate Board with an eye towards establishing codes of ethical practice for the industry.

Following A.E. LePage's retirement in 1953, the company, under new ownership, assembled 800 hectares of farmland, creating North America's first planned development in the town of Don Mills, Ontario.

In 1960, the A.E. LePage company played a pivotal role in the land assembly and office leasing of the Toronto-Dominion Centre, the largest project of its time within the British Commonwealth.

In 1964, the company offered a new service to help companies across Canada with employee relocations. The service now operates as BGRS.

In 1970, A.E. LePage rapidly expanded its residential business through more than 140 acquisitions across Canada.

In 1974, The Survey of Canadian House Prices, later known as the Royal LePage House Price Survey, was launched.

A.E. LePage and Royal Trust merged in 1984, creating the country's leading diversified real estate services organization. The new company was named Royal LePage Real Estate Services.

Royal LePage became a publicly traded company in 1987, trading on the Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal stock exchanges.

In 1994, Royal LePage began offering a franchise system.

Royal LePage launched www.royallepage.ca in 1995, Canada's first national real estate portal.

In 1998, the Royal LePage Shelter Foundation was launched, creating the only Canadian real estate company with its own charitable foundation.

The Royal LePage Franchise Services Fund was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) in 2003. That year, Royal LePage acquired Le Groupe Trans-Action.

Royal LePage re-launched its commercial division in April, 2012, as Royal LePage Commercial, and added www.royallepagecommercial.com to its online websites.

## Royal LePage Shelter Foundation

The Royal LePage Shelter Foundation is Canada's largest public foundation dedicated exclusively to supporting women's shelters, violence prevention and education programs, and ending violence against women and children. All funds raised by Royal LePage offices remain in their local community. As Royal LePage pays the costs of administration, one hundred per cent of all money and effort goes to supporting the more than 50,000 women and children who are served each year by the shelters and programs that the Shelter Foundation supports. Since 1998, the Shelter Foundation has raised $41 million, and currently supports 200 local women’s shelters and national partners.
