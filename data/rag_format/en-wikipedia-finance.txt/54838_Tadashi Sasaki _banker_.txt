# Tadashi Sasaki (banker)



**Tadashi Sasaki** (佐々木 直, *Sasaki Tadashi*, 5 May 1907 – 7 July 1988) was a Japanese central banker, and 22nd Governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ).


## Early life

Sasaki was born in Yamaguchi Prefecture.


## Banking career

Sasaki was BOJ Governor from 17 December 1969 to 16 December 1974.

Immediately prior, he had been Deputy Governor.


## Tenure as BOJ Governor

During Sasaki's tenure, BOJ became a shareholder of the Bank for International Settlements BIS); however, in 1970, the head of the Japanese central bank was not invited to become a member of the BIS Board of Directors.

In 1972 Japan experienced an unexpectedly high rate of economic growth. However, the country began to increase its focus on social welfare and quality of life, which marked a significant change from Japan's policy of "economic growth first" in the years since the end of World War II.

Inflationary pressures occurred as a result of these measures, which Sasaki countered by forecasting tighter monetary policy in early 1973.
