# Grupa Lotos



**Grupa Lotos S.A.** was a vertically integrated oil company based in Gdańsk, in northern Poland. The company was listed in the Polish index WIG30. The Polish state was the majority shareholder with 53% percent. The company's main activity branches were: crude oil production, refining and marketing of oil products.
The company was a leader in lubricants on the Polish market. Grupa Lotos was a producer of unleaded gasoline, diesel, fuel oils, aviation fuels, motor and industrial lubricants, bitumens and waxes.

In 2018 the Polish oil refiner and retailer PKN Orlen announced its intent to acquire the company.
