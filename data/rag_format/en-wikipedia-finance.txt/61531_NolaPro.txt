# NolaPro



**NolaPro** is a cloud/web-based ERP application running under a proprietary commercial license. It was first released in 2003 as a freeware accounting alternative to SAP ERP and QuickBooks because of its ability to scale in these markets.

This application can be installed via desktop download, or cloud-hosted by the author or installed locally on Microsoft Windows or Linux, accessed via common web browsers, and utilizes MySQL and PHP.

The software includes the following modules:

Multi-currency is available for NolaPro, making it one of the few small applications which supports monetary exchange rates. It has been translated into 30+ languages via contributions from the NolaPro community. An API is also available for developers who wish to integrate NolaPro with their in-house or 3rd party applications. From 2013 to 2016, NolaPro was featured on all Lenovo devices under the Windows 8 store platform.
