### Minister of Finance

On 31 May 2018, Tria was selected as Minister of Economy and Finances in the government of Giuseppe Conte. At the time, he was drafted into the government as a last-minute replacement for Paolo Savona, who was vetoed by President Sergio Mattarella because of his criticism of the euro currency.

Early in his term, Tria committed to holding the national budget deficit below 2 percent of gross domestic product but eventually came under pressure from the coalition to set a target of 2.4 percent.
