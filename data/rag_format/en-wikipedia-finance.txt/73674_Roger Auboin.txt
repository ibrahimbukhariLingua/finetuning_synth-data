# Roger Auboin



 **Camille Henri Roger Auboin** (15 May 1891 – 16 October 1974) was a French economist and central bank official. For two decades from 1938 to 1958, he was the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, including during World War II when the BIS faced severe disruption and narrowly escaped termination by the victorious allies.


## Life and career

Auboin was born in Paris. He studied law and philosophy at Sorbonne University and École Libre des Sciences Politiques, then successfully passed the examination to the Conseil d'État. From 1929 to 1932, he worked at the National Bank of Romania as the resident technical adviser from the Bank of France, where he succeeded Charles Rist, and contributed to the country's monetary and financial stabilization. In 1937 he became a member of the Bank of France's General Board.

Auboin's appointment as the second general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, following the untimely death of Pierre Quesnay, was announced in December 1937, and he took the position on 1 January 1938. He steered the BIS through the difficult period of the late 1930s and 1940s, not without controversy – especially as he authorized the transfer of the reserves of the National Bank of Czechoslovakia to the Reichsbank following the Nazi establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. He remained at the BIS until his retirement on 30 September 1958.
