## History

ArcelorMittal was formed in 2007 from the $33 billion acquisition of Arcelor by Mittal Steel Company. The merger was consummated after Mittal Steel Company raised its bid for Arcelor and the Mittal family agreed to relinquish its controlling stake in the company and execute a standstill agreement not to acquire a controlling interest without approval from independent directors. The resulting firm produced approximately 10% of the world's steel, and was at that time the largest steel company worldwide.

In August 2007, the company acquired Sicartsa, operator of a plant in Mexico, from Grupo Villacero for $1.44 billion.

In October 2007, the company acquired 90% of Rongcheng Chengshan Steelcord, a Chinese steel wire company, for $26.6 million.

To receive approval, the consortium agreed to invest €2.4 billion into Ilva, renamed ArcelorMittal Italia, while the state agreed to invest €2 billion. ArcelorMittal accused the state of not investing the agreed-upon amount and, in February 2024, Italy's industry minister took control of the venture in a manner similar to a bankruptcy, after an increase in energy prices and a drop in rolled steel coil prices led the venture to accumulate huge debts.

## Controversies and legal issues


### Pollution caused by plant in Kazakhstan

In January 2018, black snow fell in the city of Temirtau, Kazakhstan, where an ArcelorMittal plant was located, which locals blamed on the plant. The company claimed that the discoloration of the snow was caused by a lack of wind which would otherwise blow the pollution away.


### Price-fixing

Following an investigation first launched in 2008, in August 2016 the Competition Commission (South Africa) found the company guilty of price fixing. ArcelorMittal was fined US$110.9 million and, as part of the settlement, also agreed to invest R4.64 billion in capital over five years. Between January 1984 and September 2002, the companies fixed the market, prices, and exchanged confidential corporate information.


### Safety issues

In July 2018, the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration found five serious safety violations at the company's Indiana Harbor steel mill in East Chicago after the death of a steelworker while driving a golf cart at the facility with faulty brakes. The company was fined $21,000.


### Halted iron ore development in Senegal

The company entered into a $2.2 billion contract to develop an iron ore deposit in Senegal, including construction of a 750 km (466 mi) railway line. After it stalled on the contract and failed to build according to schedule, the government of Senegal sued. In September 2013, the government of Senegal won a court case before an international tribunal to rescind the deal. In June 2014, the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court in Paris awarded Senegal $150 million.
