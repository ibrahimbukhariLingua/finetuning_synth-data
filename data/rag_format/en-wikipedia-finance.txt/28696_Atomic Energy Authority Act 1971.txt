## Consequences of the Act

British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) was established in February 1971. Under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1971 the nuclear fuel business of the Production Group of the UKAEA was transferred to BNFL. This included the nuclear fuel and weapons material producing activities and the Calder Hall and Chapelcross nuclear stations, together with the facilities at Capenhurst, Springfields and Windscale. BNFL started independent activity on 1 April 1971. At the same time the production of medical and industrial radioisotopes was transferred from UKAEA to the Radiochemical Centre Limited which became **Amersham International Limited** in 1981. Following these demergers the UKAEA remit was solely for atomic energy research activities.

Various sections and subsections of the 1971 Act have been repealed.
