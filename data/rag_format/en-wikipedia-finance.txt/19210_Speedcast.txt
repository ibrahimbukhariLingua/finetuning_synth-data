## History

Speedcast was founded in September 1999 (it became Speedcast Ltd. in 2010). AsiaSat became a primary shareholder in Speedcast in March 2000. In November 2007, AsiaSat purchased all shares to become 100% owner of Speedcast. Speedcast has launched a variety of satellite telecommunications services to customers.

TA Associates, a global growth private equity firm, completed a buyout of Speedcast Ltd. from ("AsiaSat") in September 2012.

In 2012–2013, Speedcast completed the buyout of three satellite communications companies:

* Australian Satellite Communications ("ASC") based in South Australia in December 2012;
* Elektrikom Satellite Service ("Elektrikom") based in The Netherlands in January 2013; and
* Pactel International ("Pactel") was based in Australia in April 2013.

This group of companies formed the new Speedcast Group.

In June 2014, Speedcast announced the acquisition of Oceanic Broadband, an Australian integrator provider.

In August 2014, Speedcast was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange under the ticker SDA.

In 2015, Speedcast acquired six different companies:

Speedcast acquired Globecomm for US$135 million in late 2018, noting at the time that it was a good strategic opportunity. Globecomm subsequently suffered a decline in maritime business and delays to government projects in the pipeline.

In February 2020, Speedcast started looking for a new CEO after PJ Beylier resigned from the post.
