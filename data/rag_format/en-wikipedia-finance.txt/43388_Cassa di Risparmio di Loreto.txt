## History

**Monte di Risparmio della Città di Loreto** was founded in 1861 in unified Italy. It was renamed to **Cassa di Risparmio di Loreto** in the next year. in 1927 the bank absorbed "Cassa di Prestiti e Risparmio di Castelfidardo". Due to "Amato" Law, the banking activities was incorporated as a Società per azioni, while the original banking organization was renamed to the Ente Cassa di Risparmio di Loreto (later renamed to the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Loreto; Carilo Foundation) The *ente* owned 71.43% shares of the S.p.A. In 1997 Banca delle Marche became the parent company of the banking S.p.A. for 78.81% shares, with the rest were held by the banking foundation of Carilo. The move made Banca delle Marche one of the largest banking group in the region, which owned 4 out of 7 saving banks of Marche. (the remain 3 saving banks were C.R. Fabriano e Cupramontana and C.R. Ascoli (acquired by nationwide banking group and defunct in 2000s) and C.R. Fermo)

In 1996, in terms of market share in deposits in the Province of Ancona, Carilo had a market share of 4.8%, and the pro forma market share of Banca Marche banking group was 32.3%, ahead competitors Banca Popolare di Bergamo (mainly via subsidiary Banca Popolare di Ancona, predecessor of UBI Banca), Unicredito (mainly via subsidiary Cariverona, predecessor of UniCredit), Banca di Roma (predecessor of Capitalia; acquired by UniCredit in 2007), Cassa di Risparmio di Fabriano e Cupramontana (acquired by Veneto Banca) which had a market share of 13%, 11%, 9.8% and 9.6% respectively.

Followed by the special administration (Italian: *amministrazione straordinaria*, A.S.) of Banca delle Marche by the Italian State in 2013, on 17 April 2014 Carilo was also under administration (by the decree of Ministry of Economy and Finance but the Bank of Italy was the actual administrator); On 31 December 2013, Carilo had a CET1 Capital Ratio of just 5.1287%, as well as a shareholders' equity of about €32.6 million.

After Banca delle Marche was nationalized by Italian National Resolution Fund in November 2015, a fund that was mandatory contributed by the banking industry, Carilo was recapitalized for €32.5 million. Also due to decrease in risk-weight assets of the bank, Carilo returned to financial health that had a CET1 Ratio of 9.1127% on 31 December 2015. Due to diversified investment of the banking foundation, the dilution of its shares in the bank to 5.35%, had a minimal impact to the balance sheet of the foundation. The foundation had an equity of €28.5 million.

UBI Banca's subsidiary Banca Popolare di Ancona was also based in the Province of Ancona which Carilo was located, the deal got the approval from the trade union despite a concern of overlapping of banking network. The Italian Competition Authority also found out that, in the Province of Ancona, which Carilo was located, the pro-forma market share of the post-merger banking group (based on 2015 data), was over 40%.
