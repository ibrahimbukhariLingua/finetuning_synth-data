Haskayne School of Business


# Haskayne School of Business



The **Haskayne School of Business** is the University of Calgary's business school, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is named after Richard F. Haskayne, who gave one of the largest endowments to a business school in Canada. The school offers undergraduate, masters, and PhD degrees, as well as executive education programs. Haskayne is ranked as one of the top business schools in Canada and one of the top 100 in the world.


## History

Founded as the Faculty of Business in 1967 and renamed Faculty of Management in 1978, the school was later renamed in honour of Richard F. Haskayne in 2002. In 1986, the faculty moved into the newly constructed Scurfield Hall, which was the result of donations made by Ralph Scurfield, his family, and Nu-West Group of Companies. The new building cost $16 million. In 1991, an additional floor was added to the building at a cost of $3.3 million.

In 2002, Richard (Dick) Haskayne, a University of Alberta graduate, made a $16 million contribution to the school. The school was named in his honour. Haskayne donated $8 million in cash and $8.7 million in land. In 2006, the 219-acre parcel of land was sold to the City of Calgary for $20 million.

In 2018, the University announced a capital expansion project, Mathison Hall, which was the result of a $20 million gift from Ronald P. Mathison, a Calgary entrepreneur and chairman of Matco Investments, as well as other business leaders. Mathison’s father, Ken, was a lifelong friend of Richard Haskayne. The building broke ground in May 2020, and opened on January 9, 2023, at a cost of $90 million. The new four-storey, 10,000-square-metre building will expand the capacity to accommodate an additional 4,000 Haskayne School of Business students. Upon its opening, Haskayne Dean Jim Dewald called it “the most advanced business school building in Canada”.
