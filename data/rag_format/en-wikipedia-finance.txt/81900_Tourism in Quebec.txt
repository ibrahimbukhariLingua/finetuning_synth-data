Tourism in Quebec


# Tourism in Quebec



**Tourism** is the fifth-largest industry in **Quebec**. Some 29,000 companies are involved in the industry, generating 130,000 direct and 48,000 indirect jobs. In 2006, Quebec welcomed 3.2 million foreign tourists, most of them from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and Japan.

Quebec's French heritage sets the province apart from the most of Canada and the United States, as well as Mexico. The province has preserved its Francophone culture with a European feel.


## Location of Quebec

Quebec is located in the northeast portion of North America and occupies an area of 1,667,926 km² (643,820 sq. mi.). It is the largest province in Canada with three times as much area as France. It borders on the United States to the south and Ontario to the west. Over 90% of its territory is made up of the Canadian Shield. Most of its population lives in the area surrounding the St. Lawrence River in what is commonly called the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The Appalachian Mountains occupy the southern portion of Quebec.


## Culture and language


### Language

Largely French in terms of language and culture, Quebec has preserved its Francophone heritage in the midst of a strong Anglophone culture. French is the mother tongue of 82% of Quebecers, and English is the mother tongue of 10% of the population. The remaining 8% is divided among some 30 languages such as, in order of importance, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and Greek. Over 40% of the population is bilingual. In major cities like Montreal, this percentage is as high as 64%, and 16% of the population speaks a third language.


### Culture

Quebecers enjoy dining and celebrating, which is clear from the many festivities that take place in Quebec. They also enjoy literature, the performing arts, painting, sculpture and fine crafts.

The only Francophone metropolis in North America, Montreal is also the second largest Francophone city after Paris in terms of population. This major centre of 4.1 million inhabitants is a tapestry of cultures from the world over with its many neighbourhoods, including Chinatown, the Latin Quarter, the Gay Village, Little Italy, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, the Quartier International and Old Montreal.

### The St. Lawrence River

The St. Lawrence River is one of the largest rivers in the world and historically was the means of access to the centre of North America. Its 1,800 kilometres (1,120 mi.) are lined with coastal villages, bird and marine mammal sanctuaries, lighthouses and verdant and rocky shores. The river is one of the largest navigable waterways in the world, and its estuary is known for its marine mammals, birds and fish.

Upstream from Montreal to the tip of Gaspésie, a road borders the shores of the St. Lawrence River, allowing drivers to explore a coastline that changes from mountainous to rural to wilderness. Visitors can explore the rich Saguenay Fjord.

The 1,600-kilometre (994-mi.) St. Lawrence River transforms into a gulf that is more like an inland sea. The Gulf of St. Lawrence can be travelled by ferry, sailboat, kayak or cruise ship. Whale watching is popular in Quebec, particularly in Tadoussac.

There are also islands and archipelagos scattered along the river. The Île d'Anticosti and the Îles-de-la-Madeleine have legends from sailors and fishermen who continue to live there.
