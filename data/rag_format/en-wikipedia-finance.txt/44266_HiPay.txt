# HiPay

## History

HiPay Group is a former subsidiary of HiMedia Group. In 2015, the group obtained authority from the French Government (Autorité des marchés financiers) for its Euronext index listing under the ISIN code FR0012821916 and stock symbol HIPAY. The approval of the group by the French government led to the company becoming an independent legal and stock exchange entity from HiMedia Group. BJ Invest became the majority shareholder of HiPay Group as of 2016 and now has a 29.83% capital investment.

Grégoire Bourdin was appointed chief executive officer of the group on December 15, 2016, succeeding Gabriel de Montessus. The Board of Directors was entirely reorganized following the investment of BJ Invest in the Group's capital, including the resignation of HiMedia SA represented by Cyril Zimmermann from his position as director. The Board is now composed of Benjamin Jayet (Chairman), Marianne Gosset (Director) and BJ Invest Director, represented by Loïc Jauson.

In 2016, HiPay closed the year with annual sales of 30.7 million euros, an increase of 19% from 2015. In 2017, the revenue of HiPay reached €24.5 million (+28%) for an amount of €2.2 billion (+50%) in transactions processed.

In 2018, the total revenues stood at €28.8 million, up by 17%. This growth reflects the success of the commercial strategy of the company, well implemented and executed over the past two years, on both customer acquisition and supporting the growth of our existing portfolio, which enabled the company to process over €2.8 billion in transactions in 2018 up by 30% vs 2017. For 2019, HiPay announced a 37% transaction volume growth managed by its platform : €3 893 million and a revenue increase of + 21% : €34.9 million.
