### 2008-2009 IMF Ukraine mission

From October 2008 till December 2009 Pazarbasioglu was the Chief of the International Montetary Fund's mission to Ukraine. In December 2009 she was replaced by Athanasios Arvanitis. The IMF stressed that the reshuffle was not linked to developments in Ukraine.

As a result of the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis the IMF approved a $16.4bn loan to Ukraine to bolster its economy in November 2008. As Chief of the IMF Ukraine mission, Pazarbasioglu warned Ukraine in October 2009 that increases in government spending risked future IMF aid. Despite this warnings Ukrainian President Yushchenko approved an increase in social spending in November 2009 that (according to annalists) will highly increase the government deficit, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was against this law. Annalists saw Yushchenko's move as part of the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election campaign and as part of the long-lasting political struggle between him and Tymoshenko. Increasing social spending has been a major vote-winner in previous Ukrainian elections. The law was submitted by the Bloc of Lytvyn and supported by the Party of Regions of fellow presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych.
