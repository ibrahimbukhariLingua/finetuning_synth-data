## History

Originally launched as a direct selling 1P-based e-commerce platform, Hepsiburada managed its own inventory to deliver products directly to consumers. In 2015, the company went through a renewal process, gathering feedback from approximately 6 million individuals. This shift led to the adoption of an e-marketplace model, enabling various companies to open their own stores and directly deliver products to end-users. Consequently, it evolved into an e-commerce platform that integrates both 1P-based operations and an e-marketplace model.

Since July 1, 2021, it has been listed on the NASDAQ. It was first Turkish company to go public on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.

Hanzade Doğan serves as the founder and chairwoman of the Board of Directors, while Nilhan Onal Gökçacetekin has held the position of CEO since January 2023.

In its 2023 financial report, the company reported a total sales volume of 96.5 billion TRY, which adjusts to 116.5 billion TRY after accounting for inflation. This reflects a growth rate of 104 percent before inflation adjustments and 31 percent afterward. Hepsiburada boasts 12 million active customers and 101,500 active merchants. In 2022, the company reported a total sales volume amounting to 47.3 billion TRY.
