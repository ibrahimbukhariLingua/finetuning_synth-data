### Residences

In 1916, the Maynard estate in Brookville, New York known as Haut Bois was completed. The house was designed by Ogden Codman Jr. in the French style of Louis XIV's hunting lodge at the Palace of Versailles. Maynard was a Francophile and had known Codman for some time, the two of them collaborating to create the house. Jacques Greber designed the garden, reflecting pool and fountain.
