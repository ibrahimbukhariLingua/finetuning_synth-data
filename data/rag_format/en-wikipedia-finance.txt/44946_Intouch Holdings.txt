Intouch Holdings


# Intouch Holdings



**Intouch Holdings PCL** (Thai: บริษัท อินทัช โฮลดิ้งส์ จำกัด (มหาชน); formerly **Shin Corporation**) is a Thai holding company which focuses on the telecommunication industry. It is the parent company of Advanced Info Service (AIS), the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand, and Thaicom, Thailand's satellite operator. It is listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand and is part of SET50 index.

The company was founded as "Shinawatra Computer Service and Investment" by Thaksin Shinawatra, who later became the Prime Minister of Thailand. The sale of Shinawatra family's stake in Shin Corporation to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in 2006 sparked controversy, which intensified the anti-Thaksin movement.

Shin Corporation rebranded itself to Intouch in 2011, including its new stock symbol, but did not officially change its registered name until March 2014.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## History


### The early years, 1983–2006

The company was founded in 1983 as Shinawatra Computer by Thaksin Shinawatra, future Prime Minister of Thailand. The company changed its name in 1999, drawing the name "Shin" from the first four letters of Shinawatra's last name.

For its services it received the Royal Warrant on 11 June 2004, which gave it permission to display the royal Garuda emblem.


### Divestment and transition to InTouch PCL, 2006–2011

On 23 January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold its 49.6 percent stake in the company to nominees of Temasek Holdings, the Singapore government's investment arm, for US$1.88 billion. The 2006 sale of the Shinawatra family's share caused controversy in Thailand. The sale was in response to long-standing criticisms that the Shinawatra family's holdings created a conflict of interest for Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Critics of the sale focused on allegations directed toward Thaksin and a compliant government that the transaction was exempt from capital gains tax, the fact that the Thai company was sold to a Singaporean company, and the fact that the Thai law regarding foreign investments in the telecom sector had been amended just prior to the sale.

The company is linked by stock control to companies including Shin Satellite and Advanced Info Service. It also holds stakes in Thai AirAsia, a consumer finance company, and ITV, a local television station.

The company's operations are divided into four lines of business: wireless telecommunications; satellite and international business; media and advertising; E-business.


### InTouch PCL, 2011–present

On 1 April 2011 the company changed its logo and symbol on Stock Exchange of Thailand to (SET: INTUCH).

## Lawsuit

On 16 July 2003, the *Thai Post* published comments from media rights advocate Supinya Klangnarong, who said that the Shin Corporation, at the time majority owned by the family of Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had benefited because of favourable policies by the Thaksin government. Shin Corporation sued for libel in criminal court and sought 400 million baht in compensation in a civil lawsuit. Supinya and the *Thai Post* were named as co-defendants. After the Thaksin family sold its shares in Shin Corp to Singapore's Temasek Holdings, the company offered to drop the lawsuit on the condition that Supinya apologise for her comments. Supinya refused the offer.

On 14 March 2006, the Criminal Court threw out the criminal lawsuit, saying the article in the *Thai Post* was presented in good faith and in the public's best interest. On 8 May 2006, Shin Corp. asked that the civil lawsuit be withdrawn. Neither Supinya nor *Thai Post* had any objections, so the court withdrew the civil suit.
