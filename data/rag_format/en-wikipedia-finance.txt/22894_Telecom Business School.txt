# Telecom Business School



**Institut Mines-Télécom Business School** (formerly known as ***INT Management*** from its foundation in 1979 to its rebranding in 2009 then Telecom Business School from 2009 to 2018) is a French state-funded Management School, a member of Institut Mines-Télécom, the biggest group of engineering and management graduate schools in France. It is also a member of the Management School Chapter of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles, of EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development), AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) and accredited by the Association of MBAs for its Masters in Management Program.

The business school was initially founded as the corporate university of Orange Group, the first telecom operator in France and formerly a public company. It is now fully independent from Orange though many partnerships remain in research, training and other different programmes.

The school offers programmes taught in French or English, from bachelor level to PhD. Its main programme is the Masters in Management programme (aka Programme Grande École). The graduates from this programme are highly reputed among recruiters in France and abroad for their ability to work with engineers. It was ranked 75th (2019) by the Financial Times.


## Grande École System

Institut Mines-Télécom Business School is a *Grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, *Grandes Écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although they are more expensive than public universities in France, *Grandes Écoles* typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of its programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the *Grandes Écoles*. Many of the top-ranked business schools in Europe are members of the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* *(CGE)*, as is Institut Mines-Télécom Business School, and out of the 250 business schools in France, only 39 are *CGE* members.

Degrees from Institut Mines-Télécom Business School are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (French: *Le Ministère de L'éducation Nationale*). Institut Mines-Télécom Business School is further accredited by the elite international business school accrediting organizations and it holds double accreditation: The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and Association of MBAs (AMBA) In 2022, the Financial Times ranked its Masters in Management program 52nd in the world.
