# InterQuest Group Ltd



**InterQuest Group Ltd** is a recruitment business that specialises within high growth areas of the new digital economy – information security, analytics, digital, telecom and technology. InterQuest Group operates across all industry sectors with a particular focus on financial markets, public sector and professional services.

The InterQuest Group has its head office in London, with additional offices throughout the UK. In December 2013 the London Stock Exchange listed the InterQuest Group amongst its "1000 Companies to inspire Britain".


## History

InterQuest has been trading since 2001, but the acquisition of the individual brands give the company a combined recruitment experience of more than 100 years. During this time, InterQuest Group has grown to a £151 million turnover company.

InterQuest Group's growth has happened as a result of both organic growth and strategic acquisition. The organic growth has come about as a result of a multi-brand strategy which permits each brand to operate within a clearly defined area technical specialisation – information security, analytics, digital, telecom and technology.

In 2012/2013 the InterQuest Group underwent a large scale restructuring, which alongside their acquisition of ECOM, was largely attributed to its posting of positive annual financial reports in early 2014.


## Brands


### ECOM Recruitment

ECOM Recruitment is a recruitment business that specialises within the digital marketplace covering disciplines across UX, design, development, technology, product and project management, marketing and eCommerce. It is a subsidiary of InterQuest Group Ltd and is based in London with operations in Manchester and New York.


#### History

ECOM was established in Camden, London in 1999 and experienced a period of growth in the digital industry, recruiting talent for numerous companies in the Top 100 (New Media Age) list of digital agencies. They also worked with a number of recognisable brands in the UK including Retailers, Dot-com companies, Media, Publishing and FMCG businesses.

ECOM Recruitment Ltd was acquired by IT staffing firm InterQuest Group in November 2013 and its consultants operated in the digital industries across the UK.
