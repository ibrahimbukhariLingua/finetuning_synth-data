## Early life and education

Aviel earned an MBA from Yale University, where she also earned MA and BA degrees in political science. As an undergraduate student, she worked with a few other students to convince the university and Bristol-Meyers Squibb, which had an exclusive license with Yale, to make a patented drug that slowed the development of symptoms of AIDS available in South Africa for generic production and below cost. After that successful negotiation, Aviel and the other students launched the organization Universities Allied for Essential Medicines to work with universities holding medical patents to expand access to lifesaving drugs for people who need them. Aviel has also lectured at Yale University on humanitarian aid and international development.

During the worldwide financial crisis from 2009 to 2011, she served as Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Secretary Geithner described Aviel as the "conscience of the Treasury," stating that she "worked the longest hours, traveled on every trip, and brought her exceptionally high standards to helping to run the Treasury."
