## History

Ness Digital Engineering is an IT firm.
In 2011, Ness Digital Engineering had 7,000 employees around the world, with 10 satellite locations across the US, Europe, and India.

Between 1997 and 1999, New York investor Morris Wolfson, a principal of The Wolfson Group, acquired six Israeli IT companies. Following completion of these acquisitions, all the acquired companies were consolidated into a single operating structure, within Ness Technologies – a new company that was incorporated in Delaware in March 1999.

More than a decade later, Ness Technologies split into two distinct firms, Ness Technologies Israel and Ness Software Engineering Services (SES) with no affiliation to each other. In September 2016, Ness Software Engineering Services (SES) changed its name to Ness Digital Engineering to better reflect its market and business focus.
