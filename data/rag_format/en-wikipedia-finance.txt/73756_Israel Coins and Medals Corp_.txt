## State Medals of Israel

Israel State Medals are miniature works of art that commemorate the history of the Israeli nation and the historical events in Israel and the world, in which Israel takes part. They bear the Israel State Emblem with authorization from the Committee on Ceremonies and Symbols.

The first Israel State Medal, "Liberation", was issued in 1958, the tenth anniversary year of Israel. One side of the medal bears the design of the "Judaea Capta" Roman coins that were issued following the destruction of the Second Temple and victory of Rome, while the other side depicts a happy mother lifting her baby and an agriculturist planting a tree in the young State of Israel, symbolic of the rebirth of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel.

Over the years, many medals commemorating the history of the State of Israel have been issued.

Famous leaders and personalities in the history of Israel and the Jewish people are featured on medals – Prime Ministers and Presidents, Chiefs of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces who have died and Jewish Contributors to World Culture. A "Jewish Sages" Medal Series presents important Rabbis who have been influential spiritual leaders in Jewish history and a "Jewish Folktales" Series features the well-known Jewish legends. Other medal series focus on the fighting units of the Israel Defense Forces, as well as the airplanes, tanks and ships that have played a part in the annals of the State of Israel.

Examples of innovative medallic art works produced in more recent years include sculpted art medals based on biblical themes, colorful art medals depicting ancient mosaics discovered in the Holy Land and medals with inset lithographs of famous paintings.
