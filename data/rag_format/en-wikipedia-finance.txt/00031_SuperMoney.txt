## Products and Services


### SuperMoney Comparison Site

SuperMoney is not a direct supplier of financial services; it is instead a comparison platform. The company's goal is to provide a transparent data source for financial product information that helps consumers make informed financial decisions. Its comparison tools provide information on credit card selection, college loans, banking, mortgage loans, personal loans, auto loans, business loans, stock trading, insurance policies, and other financial services.

SuperMoney leverages its data to publish financial service industry studies that have been cited by media outlets such as CNBC, Business Insider, Forbes, Fox News and Reader's Digest.


### SuperMoney Loan Offer Engine

SuperMoney launched its loan offer engine in 2017 and in 2018 announced it had processed over one billion dollars worth of financing requests. Less than a year later the firm announced it had doubled that volume to $2 billion worth and then to $5 billion within two years of that. The SuperMoney loan offer engine allows a consumer to fill out a financing request which is forwarded to matching lending partners, who return pre-approved offers in real time.


### SuperMoney Point of Sale Lending Platform

SuperMoney launched its "No Fee Financing Platform" point of sale financing solution for small businesses in May 2018. The platform makes point of sale financing, in the form of point of sale loans, available to merchants and service providers across all industries including home improvement, health, and specialty retail. The platform is offered to merchants at no cost. SuperMoney generates revenue through its lending partners instead of charging merchants a discount rate fee to use the service.
