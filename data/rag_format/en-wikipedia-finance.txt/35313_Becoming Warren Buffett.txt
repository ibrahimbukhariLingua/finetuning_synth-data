## Critical reception

*The New Yorker* analyzed the dichotomy between Warren Buffett's investing prowess and personal relationship skills. The review commented, "There's another paradox the film hints at, too: the qualities that made it challenging for Buffett to deal with people are the very qualities that made him such a brilliant investor." *The New Yorker* observed, "It's also about an ability to divorce yourself from emotion, to be rational at a time when other people are acting irrationally, and to be calm when others are fearful."

*The New York Times* noted the documentary told Buffett's biography "in a relatively new way". The review commented that, though the overall portrayal of the man was positive, it also described Buffett, "as something of a remarkable human computer, gifted with numbers and less so with interpersonal relationships."

*Money* observed the film is, "Chock full of the traditionalist eccentricities the 'oracle of Omaha' is best known forâ€“like his love of Coca Cola, and the fact that he lives in the same house he bought in 1958 for $31,500". *Money* pointed out that the documentary went more in-depth than these specifics about Buffett, and "reveals a surprising set of facts even Buffett die hards may have missed."

According to the film critic news aggregation analysis on Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary garnered positive reviews from the *Los Angeles Times* and *The Washington Post*, and a negative review from *Entertainment Weekly*.
