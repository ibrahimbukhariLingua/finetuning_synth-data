**LearnShare LLC** is a software company in Maumee, OH Arrowhead Business Park. LearnShare is a human resources software for businesses. LearnShare was formed from a consortium in 1996.


## History

LearnShare LLC was founded in September 1996 as a consortium of Fortune 500 companies 3M, John Deere, General Motors, among others.


### 1995-2000: Consortium Creation

In October 1995, Rick Corry of Owens Corning invited 18 non-competing companies to discuss the formation of a collaborative training consortium. These companies then established a limited liability company.

In September 1996, four more companies joined the consortium, including Chevron and Northwest Airlines.

Each company contributed $100,000 a year for 2 years and received a seat on the board of directors. The Board also had three non-voting members from various universities.

LearnShare LLC started as a service organization that developed multi-media and distance learning technologies. The purpose was for member companies to share existing materials and expertise. The consortium would then develop technology-based training at the lowest possible cost for member companies.

Through 2000, LearnShare was funded by its founding members. Starting in 2001, the consortium hired Lois Webster from Motorola as the CEO/General Manager of LearnShare to move the company to a for-profit company.


### 2000-2007: Sustaining Members

In 2001, LearnShare accepted "sustaining members" in 2-year agreements. Since that time, 40 additional corporations joined the consortium which now represents more than 2.5 million employees.

In 2002, UnitedHealth Group purchased ownership in LearnShare and joined the Board of Management. Also in this year, LearnShare's LMS was fully functional.

LearnShare created agreements with third-party suppliers of courseware for pay-as-you access through the learning management system. LearnShare offers third party courses at the price of one course at a time.


### 2007â€“2016: A Technology Company

In 2007 LearnShare expanded its software system with modules in areas such as Performance Management and Employee Profiles. It also added the capability to the Learning Management System to integrate virtual classroom training.

In 2008, LearnShare became a management-owned company.

In 2009, it added an online conversion tool to change PowerPoint presentations to e-learning courses.

The LearnShare system now includes modules for Performance Management, Succession, and Social Collaboration and Learning.
