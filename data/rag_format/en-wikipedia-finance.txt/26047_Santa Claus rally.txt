Santa Claus rally


# Santa Claus rally



A **Santa Claus rally** is a calendar effect that involves a rise in stock prices during the last 5 trading days in December and the first 2 trading days in the following January., According to the 2019 *Stock Trader's Almanac*, the stock market has risen 1.3% on average during the 7 trading days in question since both 1950 and 1969. Over the 7 trading days in question, stock prices have historically risen 76% of the time, which is far more than the average performance over a 7-day period.

However, in the weeks prior to Christmas, stock prices have not gone up more than at other times of the year.

In 2024-2025, the S&P 500 completed a reverse Santa Claus rally by selling off during every business day between Christmas and New Year’s, a historic first for the index.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Santa Claus rally was first recorded by Yale Hirsch in his *Stock Trader's Almanac* in 1972.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has performed better in years following holiday seasons in which the Santa Claus rally does not materialize.


## Causes

There is no generally accepted explanation for the phenomenon. The rally is sometimes attributed to the following:

* Increased investor purchases in anticipation of the January effect
* Lighter volume due to holiday vacations makes it easier to move the market higher
* A slow down in tax-loss harvesting that depresses prices at the beginning of December
* Short sellers / pessimistic investors tend to take vacations around the holidays
