# Casiano Communications



**Latin Media House, LLC** acquired the assets of **Casiano Communications Inc.** (**CCI**) effective November 2, 2015 from Chapter 11 at the US Bankruptcy Court. The original company was founded in 1973, by Manuel A. Casiano, who died on May 19, 2017, at the age of 86. Casiano Communications started out publishing a business and financial newsletter on Puerto Rico which evolved over 45 years into the largestʷʰᵉʳᵉ? English speaking weekly paper *Caribbean Business*.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Latin Media House continues to publish and expand the existing publications like *Caribbean Business*, Imagen, Buena Vida or Book of Lists. The group is lead since its inception by chief executive officer and Editor in Chief Heiko Faass and employs approximately 200 persons.


## History

Recognizing the unfilled niche that an area business publication would fill, Mr. Casiano launched the newsletter that would later evolve into what is now *Caribbean Business* newspaper. For forty-three years, it had been the recognized Business Authority in Puerto Rico and the region. It was published weekly in English, and its in-depth news and analysis was read by people in the White House, the U.S. Congress, Wall Street, by Puerto Rico bond investors, the parent companies and suppliers of companies in Puerto Rico and many others. Daily business news was provided on its website, CB.pr, where it attracted more than 153,000 unique visitors a month.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In the late 1980s, its annual *Caribbean Business Book of Lists* was launched, ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ with rankings of leading companies in Puerto Rico, by industry. The list provides information on 129 local industries, more than 1500 companies, and a guide on how to do business in Puerto Rico. It has since been published every year. In 1988 Manuel A. Casiano's daughter Kimberly Casiano became an executive in the company rising to president in 1994.

While various magazines had been launched in Puerto Rico, none were truly successful because they could not compete with the quality of the magazines in Spanish that were being imported from South America. Those magazines did not include local coverage and Mr. Casiano wanted to publish a magazine that reflected Puerto Rico's people, events, the problems facing the island and so CCI began launching a new series of magazines. The various magazines cover women's and family lifestyles, health, a wedding guide, a mothers guide, a decoration guide, a baby boomers magazine for those 50 years old and over, a Quinceañera- teen girl's magazine, and the ¡Qué Pasa! tourism guide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2014, after losing several key Direct ResponSource contact center accounts amid Puerto Rico's ongoing depression, Casiano Communications and its sister operations, Direct ResponSource Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. After almost a year of court battle, in August 2015 the US Bankruptcy Court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, approved the proposed restructuring plan of a consortium of Puerto Rican business men around Miguel A. Ferrer, led by German financier and entrepreneur Heiko Faass, who resides in Puerto Rico. The court approved the acquisition of the assets of both Casiano Communications, Inc. and DirectResponSource, Inc. which were ultimately assigned to Latin Media House, LLC and DRSI Call Center, LLC, together doing business as Grupo LMH

Latin Media House, based in Puerto Rico, stated that the focus for its lead publication, *Caribbean Business*, would be on a digital edition featuring news about Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and other islands in the Caribbean and that there would be an effort to add subscribers living in the mainland United States. The founder and editor-in-chief of the defunct Casiano Communication, Manuel Casiano, was contracted to serve as an adviser to the new ownership group through November, 2016.
