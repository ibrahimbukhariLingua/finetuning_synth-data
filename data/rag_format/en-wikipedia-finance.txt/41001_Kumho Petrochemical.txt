## Management Issues

At the end of 2012, Kumho Petrochemical ended its restructuring program under creditors supervision successfully with its highest credit rating of 'A−' (Stable) by Korea Investors Service. It was the first success case since Kumho Asiana Group entered into a 'workout' program to pay down the debt at the end of 2009.

It resulted from its independent management from its parent 'Kumho Asiana Group,' based on the creditors' agreement which Park Chan-koo, fourth son of founder and chairman of Kumho Petrochemical, took responsibility for Kumho Petrochemical and its subsidiaries, and Park Sam-koo, third son and Kumho group chairman, for Kumho Tire since February 2010. Kumho Petrochemical is struggling to separate the company and its affiliates from Kumho Asiana Group.
