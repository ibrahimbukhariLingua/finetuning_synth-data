Direction générale du Trésor


# Direction générale du Trésor



The **Direction générale du Trésor** (DG Trésor, English: *Directorate General of the Treasury*, or *French Treasury*) is the flagship Directorate General of the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance. It holds an advisory role within the French Government on matters ranging from domestic to international economic policy. Its main offices are located in Paris, in the building of Bercy. The DG Trésor also represents and defends French economic interests abroad by overseeing the economic departments of embassies (French : *service économique*), and by providing permanent representations at international organizations (IMF, World Bank Group, OECD, WTO, G20, G7, specific comities of the European Commission, etc.).

The Direction générale du Trésor should not be confused with the Trésor public, a national administration responsible for France's governmental accounting.

The Direction générale du Trésor is tasked with

* Monitoring the latest economic, financial and monetary developments;
* Producing economic forecasts;
* Formulating and advising the government on national and international economic and financial policy;

* Managing the French sovereign debt through the Agence France Trésor (AFT).

## Organisation

The DG Trésor falls under the authority of the Minister of the Economy and Finance, Bruno Lemaire since May 2017, and is headed by a Director General, Emmanuel Moulin since November 2020. Additionally, the French Treasury provides the chief economist of the ministry, Agnès Bénassy-Quéré since June 2020.

The Directorate General is composed of five departments and one secretariat general:

* Macroeconomic Policies and European Affairs Department (SPMAE);
