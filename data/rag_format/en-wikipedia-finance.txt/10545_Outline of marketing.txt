Outline of marketing


# Outline of marketing



The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to marketing:

**Marketing** – social and managerial processes by which products, services, and value are exchanged in order to fulfill individuals' or groups' needs and wants. These processes include, but are not limited to, advertising, promotion, distribution, and product management.


## Core concepts in marketing

Marketers may sell goods or services directly to consumers, known as business to customer (B2C marketing); commercial organizations (known as business to business marketing or B2B), to government; to not-for-profit organizations (Not-for-profit organization (NFP)) or some combination of any of these.


### Actors and relationships


### Needs, wants and demands

Marketers typically begin planning with a detailed understanding of customer needs and wants.


### Nature of exchange

Exchange, the act of giving or taking one thing of value in return for another is central to marketing activities. Not all exchange involves Financial transactions, but may also involve barter, contra dealing or other form of trade. The object of exchange can include: Goods; services or experiences; concepts or ideas; causes and may even involve celebrity marketing


### Perceptions of value


## Foundation economic concepts

Given that marketing has its roots in economics, it shares many foundation concepts with that discipline. Most practicing marketers will have a working knowledge of basic economic concepts and theories.

Businesses seek to compete by achieving competitive advantages or comparative advantages. Competitive advantages often focus on reducing costs through achieving one or more of the following: Economies of scope; Economies of scale; Experience effects; First-mover advantages. Alternatively a business may seek to develop uniqueness through product differentiation or developing unique competencies such as market sensing, rapid market response or delivering superior customer value.
superior value.

Different types of competitive markets can be identified: Duopoly; Monopoly; Monopolistic competition; Imperfect competition; Oligopoly

Understanding demand and supply is essential for determining market size and market potential as well as in the price-setting function.

In Western economies, the capitalist economy dominates. However, other types of economic systems such as barter economies and the Sharing economy can be identified.

* Market
* Monopsony
* Oligopsony

Value-in-ownership
Value-in-use

* Marketing ethics

## Planning levels and planning tools


### Planning levels

Marketing planning is just one facet of the overall company's planning. Marketing plans must therefore take their guidance from the overall strategic plan or business plan. Most companies produce both a strategic plan and a managerial plan (also known as an operational plan). The distinction between strategic planning and management planning is that they are two phases with different goals.


### Strategic planning tools and techniques

Strategic planning requires sophisticated research and analysis to document the firm's current situation as well as to identify opportunities with the potential to be developed.


#### Strategic research methods

Strategic research is primarily concerned with the identification of new business opportunities and threats, which derive from the external operating environment. Accordingly, strategic analysts rely less on traditional market research methods. Instead, they use methods such as: Environmental scanning; Marketing intelligence (also known as competitive intelligence) and Futures research


#### Strategic analysis methods

Marketers draw on a very wide variety of techniques and tools when analyzing the market and the broader operating conditions. The technique selected depends on the nature of the situation or problem to be investigated and the analyst's skill and experience. Strategic analysts employ some 200 different quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques including:

Brand Development Index (BDI); Category development index (CDI); Brand/ Category penetration; Benchmarking; Blind spot analysis; Functional capability and resource analysis; Impact analysis; Counterfactual analysis; Demand analysis; Emerging Issues Analysis; Experience curve analysis; Gap analysis; impact analysis; se Analysis (also known as Porter's five forces analysis); Management profiling; Market segmentation analysis; Market share analysis; Market Segmentation analysis; Perceptual mapping; PEST analysis or its variants including PESTLE, STEEPLED and STEER; Portfolio analysis, such as BCG growth-share matrix or GE business screen matrix; Positioning analysis; Precursor Analysis or Evolutionary analysis; Product life cycle analysis and S-curve analysis (also known as technology life cycle or hype cycle analysis); Product evolutionary cycle analysis; Scenario analysis; Segment Share Analysis; Situation analysis; Strategic Group Analysis; SWOT analysis; Trend Analysis; Value chain analysis.
