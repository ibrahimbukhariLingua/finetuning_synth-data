Spetzler’s interest in decision quality began at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) at Stanford University (now known as SRI International), where he worked with decision theory pioneer Ronald A. Howard.

While at SRI, Spetzler was instrumental in helping client Merrill Lynch establish their Cash Management Account (CMA) product in 1977. Revolutionary for its time, the CMA was a great success for Merrill Lynch and inspired its competitors to introduce similar products. Author Joe Nocera describes Spetzler’s key role in the development of the CMA in his book *A Piece of the Action: How the Middle Class Joined the Money Class*.

In 1981, Spetzler and Howard formed Strategic Decisions Group (SDG), a management consulting firm focused on using the principles of decision quality to help organizations improve their strategic planning, innovation, and risk management.

Spetzler is the Chairman and CEO of SDG. He also serves as the program director of the Strategic Decision and Risk Management Program at Stanford’s Center for Professional Development.
