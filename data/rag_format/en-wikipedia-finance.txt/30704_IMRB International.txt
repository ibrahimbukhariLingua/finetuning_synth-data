## History

IMRB was established in 1971 (official start date 15 March 1971), to provide market research services to the clients of Hindustan Thompson Associates, although work was going on from an earlier date (as early as 1967). Early clients included fast-moving consumer goods companies such as Unilever, ITC, Pond’s, and Horlicks. The initial decade saw rapid expansion into new areas of business, with the first qualitative study being conducted by the end of the decade, and IMRB pioneering psephology in India through an ongoing series of opinion poll surveys for *India Today*, that successfully predicted Congress’ victory in the 1980 general election.

Subsequent decades saw the development of new verticals, with the creation of specialized units and the offering of several syndicated research products. IMRB also played an important role in the standardization of market research practice in India, and was responsible for the creation in 1983 of the Socio-Economic Classification system, a method now used across India to define target audiences. In 1987, as a founder member of the MRSI, it helped evolve industry wide codes of conduct, and standards for survey data collection that are still in use today.

With the global acquisition of J. Walter Thompson by Sir Martin Sorrell in 1987, IMRB became a constituent of WPP and continued its pace of growth, growing over 25% per annum through the 1990s under the leadership of Ramesh Thadani. The 1990s saw the creation of specialized units focusing on development research, employee satisfaction, loyalty programs, technology and media and the acquisition of several new multinational clients. IMRB's insights also played a role in the development of several new products for major Indian brands such as Marico, Bingo Chips, Godrej and Dabur and by this time supported 40 out of top 50 brands in India.

In 2002, as part of a process of rebranding, it changed its name from the Indian Market Research Bureau to IMRB International, adopted a new logo, and began a process of rapidly expanding its international services. This was accompanied by a shift from its offices at Esplanade Mansion to its current premises in Dadar, Mumbai. As part of geographical expansion, IMRB helped set up LMRB in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1981 and AMRB in 1999 with headquarters in Dubai and offices throughout the Middle East and North Africa.

In 1996, along with the Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT) IMRB initiated the periodic ITOPS survey which monitors the IT hardware market among households and businesses. Since 1998, in collaboration with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), an industry body IMRB also started providing a series of annual syndicated research reports named I-Cube which surveys the online and mobile landscape in India. More recently, in 2010 IMRB launched the Web Audience Measurement (WAM) system, India’s first standardized internet audience measurement system based on a panel.
