Following the success of the Weingarten's and Randall's supermarket chains in Houston, Gerland's added bakery and delicatessen departments to its stores in the late 1970s. In recent decades both in-store pharmacies and gas stations were added at certain locations; however, the two gas stations that were in service have both been shut down and repaved.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1980 Gerland's had 6% of the Houston-area grocery market share, making it the fifth largest grocer there. Gerland's acquired several stores from the defunct Weingarten chain in 1981, and operated more than 40 store locations in the Houston area by 1990. While most were company-owned, a handful of the Gerland's stores were independently owned franchises.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 1994 Gerland acquired five stores from Appletree Markets. On February 28, 1999, Gerland's had 15 locations. It had an annual sales of $163.5 million. It had 3.1% of the Houston market, making it the sixth largest grocer in Houston. It had 1,650 Houston-area employees. Within the year until February 28, 1999, it remodeled one store. In July 1999 it had 3.2% of the area market share, still being the sixth largest grocer. In 2002 Gerland's was Houston's seventh largest grocer, with 16 locations generating $185.9 million in sales. It had 1,005 Houston area employees. At the time its headquarters was in Pasadena.
