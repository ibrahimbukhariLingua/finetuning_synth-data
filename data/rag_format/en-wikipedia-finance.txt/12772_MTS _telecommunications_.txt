## History

In 1994, a joint venture of Moscow City Telephone Network, T-Mobile and Siemens, which later MTS GSM (Mobile TeleSeratout) became part of Mobile TeleSystems (MTS), offered Russia's MTS GSM first mobile phone service "Mobile Telecommunications" (Russian: Мобильные ТелеСвязи) for the public in Moscow. In the same year in June, VimpelCom also started Beeline mobile phone service. MTS, having started Mobile TeleSeratout in the Moscow license zone in 1994, received licenses in 1997 for further areas and began expansion across Russia, later entering other countries of the CIS.

In 2009, MTS acquired several independent mobile retail chains, creating MTS monobrand retail network of 3300 stores — the second largest retail network in Russia. Also in 2009 MTS started marketing MTS-branded mobile handsets. In 2010, MTS became the 5th best selling handset brand in Russia, after Nokia, Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Former operations


### MTS Turkmenistan

On 25 July 2012, MTS signed an agreement with the Turkmentelecom enterprise of Ministry of Communications of Turkmenistan, which says that MTS Turkmenistan will on a monthly basis pay to Turkmentelecom 30% of its net profit derived from operations in Turkmenistan. This agreement is for five years and may be extended another five years subject to some conditions. The company has also been granted GSM and 3G licenses for a three-year term.

MTS Turkmenistan in September 2017 faced termination of the permit to use the dedicated radio frequency spectrum and some other required resources. The provision of communication services to subscribers in Turkmenistan was suspended with network shutdown and no successor. As of 2016, MTS-Turkmenistan had 1.7 million subscribers at its peak.


### MTS Uzbekistan

Uzdunrobita was the largest mobile phone operator in Uzbekistan in the 1990s and 2000s. Uzdunrobita was founded in 1991, as a joint venture between a group of American investors, the International Communications Group, with a 45% stake; and the government of what was then the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, with a 55% stake. When Uzbekistan declared independence several weeks later, the registration of the joint venture was shifted from Moscow to Tashkent, with the government stake taken over by the independent Uzbek government.

The company first turned a profit in 1993. By 1996, it had $50 million in annual revenues, 7,000 subscribers, and employed 224 staff. Gulnora Karimova gained control of the firm in the late 1990s or early 2000s, and by 2005 it was 74% owned by Russia's MTS, which paid $121 million for the stake. In 2006 it was reported to have 250,000 subscribers, ahead of Daewoo Unitel, which had 100,000, and a number of much smaller firms.

The company launched an LTE network on 2.6 GHz in July 2010, and receive a license to expand it on 700 MHz in December 2010.

The brand UMC in Uzbekistan existed until mid-2007, when a major rebranding campaign occurred turning UMC into MTS. In July 2012, authorities in Uzbekistan announced the suspension of the operating license of MTS's subsidiary Uzdunrobita. Officials argued that MTS-Uzbekistan has been responsible for a series of technical violations, and its operations have been suspended beginning on the evening of July 17. According to the MTS, the suspension could affect millions of Uzbek mobile phone users. An MTS statement said the firm has some 10 million clients among Uzbekistan's population of 28 million.

In August 2012, the government of Uzbekistan revoked the company's operating license and arrested several of its top management, citing repeated regulatory violations. MTS protested the action as a "shakedown", but was unable to effectively oppose it, and moved to write down its stake. At the completion of the case in September 2012, the company's assets were seized, and some of its executives sentenced to prison terms.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted and declared that Russia was concerned about the situation with Mobile TeleSystems’ Uzbekistan subsidiary Uzdunrobita, after Uzbek authorities suspended the mobile operator's license and put a senior official into custody. The dispute, which analysts fear may lead to MTS exiting the market, broke out at the beginning of 2012 when Uzbek authorities launched a near $1.3 million back-tax claim against MTS. MTS said in an e-mailed statement that the actions of the Uzbek authorities may be interpreted as “baseless attacks on the business of the Russian investor.” However, in 2019, The United States Department of Justice charged the firm for bribery to secure contracts in Uzbekistan. MTS agreed to pay a penalty of $850 million.


### MTS India

In 2008, Sistema formed 74:26 joint venture with India's Shyam Group to form Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL), and acquired a pan-India licence to provide CDMA services in the country. In March 2009, SSTL launched the MTS India brand in the state of Tamil Nadu, followed by neighbouring states Kerala and West Bengal in April and May respectively. Following the cancellation of its licences by the Supreme Court of India, MTS is present in 9 circles out of 22 telecom circles of India. MTS India was acquired by Reliance Communications (RCom) on 14 January 2016 in an all-stock deal, in which SSTL received a 10% share in RCom. SSTL was merged into RCom on 31 October 2017.


### MTS Ukraine

On 31 October 2008, Vodafone announced a partnership deal with MTS, whereby Vodafone services will be available to MTS subscribers and both companies have noted the potential for more efficient purchasing, starting with operations in Ukraine.

In October 2015, Mobile TeleSystems and Vodafone expanded their strategic partnership; this resulted in the rebranding of MTS Ukraine to Vodafone Ukraine. MTS sold its Ukraine operations in 2019.


### MTS Armenia

In Armenia, services under the MTS brand were provided by K-Telecom CJSC, under the brand names VivaCell-MTS [hy] (from 2007-2019) and Viva-MTS (from 2019-2024), 80% of which were owned by Mobile TeleSystems.
