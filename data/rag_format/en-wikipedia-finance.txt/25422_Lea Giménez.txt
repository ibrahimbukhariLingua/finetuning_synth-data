## Career

Giménez led the preparation of President Santiago Peña's government plan for the 2023-2028 period and was the Head of the Transition Team for President-elect Santiago Peña. As Chief of the Civil Cabinet of the Presidency of the Republic of Paraguay, she was responsible for coordinating, managing, and overseeing policy development, operations, and Cabinet-related decisions for the President. Additionally, she was in charge of structuring and leading the Presidency’s Management Unit, which oversees the government’s strategic and flagship projects and programs. These initiatives include the development and implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, strategic infrastructure projects, the Che Roga Pora housing program, the digitalization of the public health sector with the support of the Republic of China Taiwan, and the design and execution of key projects such as SUMAR and Zero Hunger in Schools.

As Minister of Finance, she chaired the National Economic Team and established and chaired the Technical Tax Commission of Paraguay.
