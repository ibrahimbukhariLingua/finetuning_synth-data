## History

Janus was founded by Thomas H. Bailey in 1969. A controlling interest was purchased by Kansas City Southern Industries in 1984. Kansas City Southern Industries then demerged its financial services businesses to create Stilwell Financial in 1999. Bailey stepped down as president and CEO in June 2002.

The company was renamed Janus Capital Group, following the integration of Janus Capital Corporation into its parent company, Stilwell Financial, in January 2003.

The Janus Fund opened in 1970 with approximately a few hundred thousand dollars in assets.

Further funds were launched in 1985, including the Janus Venture Fund, its first small cap equity fund, and the Janus Twenty Fund, its first concentrated equity fund.

In 1991, Janus launched a number of other new types of fund, including its first global equity fund, the Janus Worldwide Fund, its first international equity fund, the Janus Overseas Fund, and its first mid cap equity fund, the Janus Enterprise Fund. It also launched the Janus Aspen Series (JAS), a product line created for investors wanting to invest in Janus through variable insurance contracts or certain qualified retirement plans.

Myron Scholes, Nobel laureate and Ph.D., joined Janus as chief investment strategist on July 8, 2014.

On September 26, 2014, Bill Gross left Pimco to join Janus as manager of the Janus global unconstrained bond strategy.

In October 2014, Janus acquired VS Holdings, a company based in Darien, Connecticut, and its VelocityShares business.

In July 2015, Janus acquired a majority interest in Kapstream Capital, a fixed income specialist.

In February 2016, Janus launched a small cap growth and small cap/mid cap growth ETF, followed in June by four new ETFs around investment themes – long-term care, health and fitness, organic foods and personal care (including health care issues related to obesity).

On October 3, 2016, Janus Capital Group Inc and Henderson Group plc announced a recommended merger of equals to create Janus Henderson.
