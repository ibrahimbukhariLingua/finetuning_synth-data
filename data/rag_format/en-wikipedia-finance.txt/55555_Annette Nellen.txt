## Research

Nellen's tax research focuses on tax reforms and state taxation as well as curriculum development in taxation studies. She was the lead author of the *Guiding Principles of Good Tax Policy: A Framework for Evaluating Tax Proposals*, presenting a set of 12 principles for assessing proposed changes to existing tax regulations. Her 2021 op-ed offered 3 questions to ask Congress that would make United States' tax system more fair and simple. In her textbook titled *Tax Aspects of Business Transactions: A First Course*, she provided an overview of tax concepts, highlighted the interplay between financial and tax accounting, underscored the significance of tax regulations and principles in financial accounting, and illustrated the pivotal role of taxes in the business decision-making process. Emphasizing the need to adapt tax policies and rules to the modern digital age, specifically with regard to Internet transactions and e-commerce, she offered a structured framework for analyzing and addressing these challenges within the principles of good tax policy. Her 2015 study proposed that entrepreneurs and their tax advisors need to be proactive in adapting to the evolving landscape of technology and taxation, and they should anticipate new guidance and regulations as the digital economy continues to transform the business environment. In her formal analysis of US tax policies, she argued that poorly structured taxes lead to significant reductions in taxes for high-income individuals and advocated for the elimination of costly and unnecessary tax breaks to improve equity, neutrality and simplicity of tax systems. Moreover, she conducted an analysis of the role of consumption taxes within California's taxation system and subsequently offered recommendations for potential tax system reforms aimed at achieving specific objectives pertaining to revenue generation, equity, and the mitigation of externalities.
