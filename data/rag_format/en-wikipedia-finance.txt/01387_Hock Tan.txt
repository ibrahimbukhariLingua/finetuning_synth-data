**Tan Hock Eng** (Chinese: 陳福陽; pinyin: *Chén Fúyáng*; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: *Tân Hok-iâng*; born 1951 or 1952) is a Malaysian-born Chinese-American business executive. He is the CEO of Broadcom Inc. He was the highest-earning CEO in the US in 2017, earning US$103.2 million that year.


## Early life and education

Tan was born in Penang, Malaysia, in 1951 or 1952. He received a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1971. In 1975, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and earned a master's degree in the same subject later in the year. Tan also attended Harvard University to earn an MBA a few years later.


## Career

He was managing director of Hume Industries in Malaysia from 1983 to 1988 before helming Pacven Investment from 1988 to 1992. He then held financial positions at General Motors Co and PepsiCo Inc before becoming the Vice President of Finance of Commodore International Ltd.

Tan went on to become the CEO of Integrated Circuit Systems Inc. When this was sold to Integrated Device Technology Inc, he became the latter company's chairman.

Avago was created following a US$2.66 billion private equity buyout of the Semiconductor Products Group of Agilent Technologies in 2005. Tan was hired to lead this new company as chief executive.

In 2015, Tan merged the company with Broadcom Corporation following an acquisition, leading to the creation of Broadcom Inc which he currently runs.

In November 2017 Broadcom announced that it had completed its move from Singapore back to the United States in a move which Tan claimed at the time would yield $20 billion yearly in revenue for the US Treasury.

In April 2020 Tan drew criticism when it was announced that he was forcing employees of Broadcom to return to work for 1 week a month during the COVID-19 outbreak. In September 2020, Tan stated that all Broadcom employees were working in the office in Asia excluding India, and 50% in North America.

In 2023, Tan's total compensation from Broadcom was $161.8 million, up 167% from the previous year and representing a CEO-to-median worker pay ratio of 510-to-1 for the company, as well as making Tan the third highest paid CEO in the US that year.

Since February 2024, he is a member of the board of directors of Meta.


## Personal life

Tan became a U.S. citizen in 1990. He married K. Lisa Yang. Born in Singapore, Yang graduated from Cornell University. After the family moved to the U.S., Yang worked as an investment banker on Wall Street until retiring.

Their three children spent their early years in Singapore. The family moved to Philadelphia after their son Douglas was diagnosed with autism by a pediatric neurologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who suggested the boy would receive a better education in the U.S. Douglas attended the Timothy School in Philadelphia, and now lives in a Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health group home. Their daughter Eva has been diagnosed with a milder form of autism. Yang helped Eva with her "poor auditory processing skills" when she started taking classes at Harcum College. Eva was later hired by SAP under their Autism at Work program. Their other son, who does not have autism, works as an investment banker in California.

Tan divorced K. Lisa Yang and married Lya Truong.
