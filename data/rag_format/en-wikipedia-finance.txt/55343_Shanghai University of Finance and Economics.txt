Shanghai University of Finance and Economics


# Shanghai University of Finance and Economics



The **Shanghai University of Finance and Economics** (**SUFE**) is a public finance and economics university located in Shanghai, China. The university is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. It is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211.

In 2005, SUFE introduced the academic tenure and became the first university in China to adopt this system.


## History

The university began as a business program at the Nanjing Advanced Normal School in 1917. The program was relocated to Shanghai and became the Shanghai University of Commerce in 1921.

Over the years the university had evolved. By 1928, It was renamed as the School of Commerce of the Central University. In 1932, it was split from the Central University and became the National Shanghai College of Commerce. In 1950, the institution became the Shanghai College of Finance and Economics. The institution adopted its present name the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 1985. Chen Yun, who was then a top leader of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, wrote the inscription of the school's name.

Since then, SUFE has developed into a multidimensional university which focuses on applied economics and management, with economic theories as its basis. Its subjects include science, social sciences, laws, philosophy and humanities. Its aim is to train students to graduate with practical knowledge, versatile talents and a broad view. In 1997, Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription for the university: *Facing the new century, let us build the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics into a top-level socialist university* (面向新世纪把上海财经大学建设成为具有一流水平的社会主义大学).


## Present

At present, the university comprises 12 academic schools, one graduate school and more than 20 finance and economics research centers. It also encompasses the School of Continuing (Adult) Education, the School of Online Learning, the School of International Education, and a vocational school. China's rapid economic expansion has tremendously impacted SUFE, which is now bustling with such activities. In 1981, SUFE became the first finance and economics university to receive accreditation for granting doctoral degrees. In addition, it was among the first nine schools to be selected as an "M.B.A. Experimental Education Base" and one of the first schools to set up a post-doctoral program in economics. In 1996, SUFE joined the Project 211. In 2002, SUFE became the first mainland university to offer a master's program in Hong Kong. All of its programs continue to exceed world standards and are imbued with modernity, internationalism and cutting-edge information. It is included in the Double First-Class Construction published by the central government of China.
