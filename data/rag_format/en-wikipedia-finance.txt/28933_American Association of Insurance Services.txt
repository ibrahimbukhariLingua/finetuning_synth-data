## History

AAIS was founded in 1936 as The Mutual Marine Conference, focused exclusively on inland marine insurance. In 1947, The Mutual Marine Conference became the Transportation Insurance Rating Bureau (TIRB). Its company practices focused primarily on tariff and regulatory declarations concerning travel insurance risks. The activities of the Rating Bureau slowly expanded to involve all threats of property.

In 1975, TIRB became the American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS), broadening its scope to include all insurance products.

In 1984, AAIS was incorporated in Delaware as a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization.

In 2018, AAIS gained approval from the California Department of Insurance for CannaBOP, the first-of-its-kind Businessowners Policy designed for cannabis dispensaries, storage facilities, processors, manufacturers, distributors, and other cannabis-related businesses operating in California.

In 2018, AAIS collaborated with IBM to introduce openIDL (open Insurance Data Link), the first open blockchain platform focused on the collection and sharing of statistical data between insurance carriers and regulators.

In 2023, AAIS announced Werner E. Kruck as President and CEO.
