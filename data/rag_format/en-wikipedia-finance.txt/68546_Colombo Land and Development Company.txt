# Colombo Land and Development Company



**Colombo Land and Development Company PLC** (**CLDC**) is a Sri Lankan property development and holding company involved in mixed development projects in the real estate and retail sector. Established on 8 December 1981, CLDC was subsequently listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange on 19 March 1986. The company is the developer and the owner of Liberty Plaza, Colombo.

The company's principal activities encompass the development and leasing of investment properties, particularly at Liberty Plaza. Additionally, CLDC manages vehicle car parks at both Liberty Plaza and Pettah locations.


## Operations

CLDC's primary activities include the development and leasing of investment properties. Notably, Liberty Plaza serves as a flagship project, reflecting the company's ability to sustain the relevance of the mall through expansion, modernisation, and diversification of retail brands and tenants. The group currently holds 83 shops, 10 offices, and apartments at Liberty Plaza, covering over 16,400 m² (176,000 sq ft). Additionally, CLDC owns and manages five levels of car park operations at the complex, accommodating over 250 cars and 100 motorcycles.

In the heart of Colombo, Gasland Car Park stands as a crucial distribution hub for traders, covering an area of nearly 1.2 ha (3 acres) and holding the highest value among CLDC's investment properties. The People's Car Park, situated atop the People's Park shopping complex, offers 185 vehicle parking bays and 80 motorcycle bays. A recent refurbishment in 2021 equipped it with solar power panels, transforming it into a renewable energy source for the entire complex.

CLDC's sustainable development commitment is evident through its fully-owned subsidiary, Agri Spice (Pvt) Ltd., operating a 41 ha (102 acres) plantation in Avissawella. The subsidiary cultivates Mahogany, Rubber, and Alstoniya, reflecting CLDC's dedication to environmentally friendly sectors.

Notably, Dilith Jayaweera, a non-executive director, stepped down in September 2023 upon entering politics.
