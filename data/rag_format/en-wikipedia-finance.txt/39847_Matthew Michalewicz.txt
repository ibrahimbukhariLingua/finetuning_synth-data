## Early life and education

Matthew Michalewicz was born in 1976 in Poland, the son of Zbigniew Michalewicz, an author and professor.

His grandfather had originally emigrated to the United States in 1910, but Matthew's mother visited Poland in 1939 and became trapped in the country due to World War II. In 1982, his family fled from communist Poland to New Zealand but came to the United States in 1989 when his father became chairman of the UNC Charlotte's computer science department.

Michalewicz earned a degree in financial management from UNC in 1998


## Career

Michalewicz launched his first business when he was 18 years old, which was a personal training company called Fitness Forever. After finishing college, he joined Ernst & Young as a management consultant, and later left to start a money management company with Dan Cullen, a former Edward Jones money manager.


### NuTech Solutions

In 1999, Michalewicz co-founded NuTech Solutions, Inc. with his father and Dan Cullen, where he worked as the company's president and chief executive until 2003. With the help of Cullen, he was able to raise $15 Million in private funds from angel investors. He incorporated the company in 1999 and began to absorb other companies in locations such as Charlotte, Denver, Poland, Germany, and Japan. During his time with NuTech, he helped grow the company to 150 employees (30 of whom had doctorates). The company also planned to file for an initial public offering but abandoned the plan after the stock market crash of 2000.

The software developed by NuTech Solutions used artificial intelligence to boost the efficiency of client's manufacturing, distribution, and customer service. The software was used by Ford Motor Company to help find profitable ways to sell off-lease cars and by Bank of America to help fight credit card fraud. Former Bank of America CEO Hugh McColl also invested personally into NuTech Solutions and served on the company's board of directors. NuTech was purchased by Netezza Corporation in 2008, and Netezza was later acquired by IBM.


### SolveIT Software

Michalewicz co-founded SolveIT Software in 2004, a year after his arrival in Australia. The other co-founders are Zbigniew Michalewicz, Martin Schmidt, and Constantine Chiriac. All were the co-authors of the book Adaptive Business Intelligence. Several employees from NuTech also came to join the new company including NuTech board member and former president of Poland Lech Wales. The company develops advanced planning and scheduling optimization software, which helps manage complex operations using artificial intelligence. Most of the products were initially developed around the key South Australian industries of wine and grain handling, and today SolveIt has a specialist mining division due to early adoption of the company's products within the mining market. The software helps companies optimize their production, logistics, maintenance, and workforce activities.

During his time at SolveIT, Michalewicz has grown the company to approximately 150 employees and 5 international offices. He also secured contracts with many companies including Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue Metals Group, Xstrata, BMA Coal and Incitec Pivot.

In September 2012, SolveIT Software was purchased by French industrial company Schneider Electric. As part of the purchase, it was announced that the software systems owned by SolveIT would be integrated into Schneider's MES software to create a single platform. It was also announced that Michalewicz would stay with the company after the acquisition was complete.


### Complexica

Michalewicz co-founded Complexica in 2014, which is a leading provider of Artificial Intelligence software. The company's core product – an AI-based software robot called Larry, the Digital Analyst – can help organisations increase revenue, margin, and productivity using automated analytics.

Michalewicz has received numerous awards and recognitions throughout his career. He received the Outstanding Young Alumnus Award from the University of North Carolina in 2002. The award is presented annually to a former UNC graduate who shows exceptional service to the UNC Charlotte community and the Alumni Association.
