# SFS Group



The **SFS Group AG** is concerned with precision components and assemblies, mechanical fastening systems, tooling and logistics systems. The headquarters are located in Heerbrugg, Switzerland. SFS employed nearly 11,000 people worldwide in 2021 and generated sales of SFr 1.89 billion with around 10,500 employees worldwide.


## History

The history of SFS began in 1928 in what was then the Stadler hardware store in Altstätten, Switzerland. In 1949, a branch was opened in nearby Heerbrugg. Motivated by supply bottlenecks, Josef Stadler and Hans Huber decided to set up their own screw production and jointly founded SFS Presswerk AG in 1960. Production was carried out by cold forming (also known as cold massive forming).

Both trading and manufacturing activities were continuously expanded in the following decades. From 1971, the company built up an international network of market organizations. In 1993, the activities were combined under the umbrella of SFS Holding AG, and in 2014 the name was changed to SFS Group AG. Today, the activities are divided into the three segments Engineered Components, Fastening Systems and Distribution & Logistics.

Today, SFS operates more than 100 trading, logistics and manufacturing locations worldwide. Through various acquisitions, SFS has been able to include plastic injection molding technology and deep drawing technology.

On September 1, 2012, SFS acquired Singapore-based Unisteel Technology Group, which operates in the field of miniature fasteners (for smartphones and hard drives, for example) and has production facilities in Malaysia and China. Although SFS itself also produces miniature screws, which with a diameter of 0.5 mm are among the thinnest in the world, it was increasingly losing market share in this area of application due to the continuous exodus of the cell phone industry. By acquiring the Unisteel Technology Group, SFS consolidated its position in this market segment. With the expansion of production capacities in Nansha (CN), the company is further increasing component production in Asia.

Since 7 May 2014 SFS is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX: SFSN).

With the 2016 acquisitions of Stamm (Switzerland) and Tegra Medical (USA), SFS has expanded its position in the growing medical technology industry. This gives SFS access to a large, largely complementary portfolio of customers.

In 2018, the brands SFS intec and SFS unimarket merged and now appear as SFS.

With the acquisition of Hoffmann SE, headquartered in Munich (Germany) in 2021, SFS is expanding its range of tools and creating new development opportunities through the internationalization of its trading business.
