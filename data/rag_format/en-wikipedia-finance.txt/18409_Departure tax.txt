A **departure tax** is a fee charged (under various names) by a country when a person is leaving the country.


## Background

Some countries charge a departure tax only when a person is leaving by air. In these cases, the departure tax can be *de facto* the same as the **air passenger tax**, although the latter can also apply to domestic flights that are therefore not departure taxes, as no international borders are crossed.

Various rules apply to the purchase and payment of the tax, including payment at the airport to those about to catch a flight (sometimes only in the local currency and sometimes by credit card), or by some prepayment method, or it may be charged to the airlines and included in the airline ticket price.
