## Career

In 1985, aged 25, he co-founded Shore Capital, (then known as Puma Securities) as an independent stockbroker with an initial investment of £10,000, providing trading services on behalf of high net worth individuals.

Following an investment from British Land, a London property firm, Shore grew the business, initially market-making in AIM-listed stocks and then in fully listed stocks on the London Stock Exchange. In 2000, following the acquisition of internet firm Jellyworks, Shore Capital floated on the AIM stock market.

In 2006 Puma Brandenburg Limited was established, initially as a listed property investment vehicle focused on German real estate. It was subsequently taken private by Shore and his wife, and is now the main vehicle through which he conducts his private investment activities. As well as real estate in Germany, the US and Israel, it has invested in other asset classes including providing growth capital for entrepreneurially led private businesses.

In February 2019, Puma Brandenburg led a US$30m investment in medical device company, Ador and Shore became a director of the company.

In 2015, Shore established Brandenburg Realty Limited, raising funds from institutional investors and family offices, predominantly from the United States, to invest in German residential real estate.

Shore announced that he was relinquishing operational responsibilities for Shore Capital in 2017 but he remains as chairman of the Group.
