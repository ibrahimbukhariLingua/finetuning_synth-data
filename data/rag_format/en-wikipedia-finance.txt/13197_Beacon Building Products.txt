## Company History

Beacon was established in 1928 in Charlestown, Massachusetts, as Beacon Sales Company. By 1953, the company had outgrown its building in Charlestown, and built a new facility in nearby Somerville. In the 1970s, the company expanded to Worcester, Massachusetts and Lewiston, Maine. In 1984, Andrew Logie bought a majority interest in the company. At that time, sales were almost $17 million, virtually all in commercial roofing. Shortly after Logie became CEO, David Grace joined Beacon as the company's chief financial officer. During Logie's tenure, the company opened new branches throughout the United States, and expanded into residential roofing as well as commercial roofing. By 1997, seven branches were generating $72 million in annual sales

In 1997, the equity firm Code, Hennessy & Simmons III, L.P. purchased a majority interest in the company. They re-branded it as Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. In 1998, Beacon, in an attempt to acquire successful distributors, purchased its first regional brand, Quality Roofing Supply, a Pennsylvania based roofing distributor. From 1999 to 2000, Beacon continued its purchase of regional roofing distributors by acquiring Best Distributing (North Carolina), Groupe Bedard and Exeltherm Supply (Canada), The Roof Center (Maryland and Virginia) and West End Lumber (Texas).


### 2002 - 2011

By 2002, Beacon had surpassed $500 million in revenue. Early in fiscal 2004, Robert R. Buck joined the company and succeed Andrew Logie as president and CEO. To obtain money to grow the company, Beacon went public with an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange, on September 23, 2004. In 2005, *The Wall Street Journal* ranked Beacon as the sixth-fastest-growing new stock issue behind Google.

The company continued to acquire successful distributors across North America and drive organic growth in existing operations. Within three months of the IPO, Beacon acquired Atlanta-based JGA Corp., which had sales of $74 million. In October 2005, Beacon's made its largest acquisition by purchasing Shelter Distribution, a midwestern distributor with sales of $313 million and 50 branches.

Sales surpassed $850 million in fiscal 2005 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2006. In April 2007, Beacon acquired North Coast Commercial Roofing Systems based in Twinsburg, Ohio, which had sales in excess of $250 million. This strategic acquisition moved Beacon into three new states—Ohio, New York and West Virginia. At this point, operations now encompassed 172 branches in 37 states and 3 Canadian provinces.

In October 2007, Beacon announced the appointment of Paul M. Isabella as president and chief operating officer.

At the end of 2010, Robert Buck relinquished the title of CEO to Paul Isabella while retaining the title of chairman of the board. Today, Buck remains actively involved with the investment community, acquisitions and monitoring organizational structure and leadership.
