## Business career


### U.S. Global Investors

Prior to Holmes’ involvement, U.S. Global Investors (then known as United Services Advisors) was rocked by a scandal involving one of the firm’s fund managers, who was found to be taking bribes from stock promoters. Both the manager and the promoters were convicted of criminal charges for their roles in the case. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) discovered that the president of United Services knew of the illegal behavior before he disclosed it to the commission. In 1989, United Services Advisors was put up for sale at auction and won by Holmes for $2.2 million, or $4 a share.

The company was rebranded to U.S. Global Investors and regained its reputation. The company, which offers 10 different funds, is now profitable, according to regulatory filings for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Holmes owns 100% of the voting shares of U.S. Global Investors.

In 2006, Holmes was named Mining Fund Manager of the Year by *The Mining Journal,* a London-based publication for the global natural resources industry.

Holmes became an elected member of the Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO) in 1991 and served as chairman of the San Antonio chapter from 1997 to 1998.
