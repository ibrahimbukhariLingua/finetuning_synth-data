## History

In 1992, upon their return to Morocco, Adil Douiri and Amyn Alami co-founded Morocco's first investment bank, originally named *Casablanca Finance Group*.

They were supported by Abdelaziz El Alami (chairman of BCM) and Othman Benjelloun (chairman of BMCE Bank).

In 1998, it acquired a license as a bank specializing in market activities.

In 2001, under the brand Dar Tawfir, CFG Group began distributing savings products to individuals and in 2005 launched the first online stock trading site in Morocco, Africa, and the Middle East.

In November 2015, CFG Group became CFG Bank.

In October 2023, CFG Bank aims to be listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, which will involve a capital increase with an expected amount of 600 million dirhams, approximately 55 million euros.
