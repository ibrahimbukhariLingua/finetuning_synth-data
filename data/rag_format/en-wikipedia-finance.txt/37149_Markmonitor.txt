**Markmonitor Inc.** is an American software company founded in 1999. It develops software intended to protect corporate brands from Internet counterfeiting, fraud, piracy, and cybersquatting. MarkMonitor also develops and publishes reports on the prevalence of brand abuse on the Internet.

## History

Markmonitor was founded in 1999 in Boise, Idaho and its initial business as a service provider for the protection of corporate trademarks on the Internet. In 2000, it gained ICANN accreditation status for domain registration and acquired a domain management business called AllDomains the following year.

In October 2010, Markmonitor acquired an anti-piracy company (DtecNet) and was itself purchased by Thomson Reuters' Intellectual Property & Science business in July 2012. In 2016, the IP division of Reuters, including Markmonitor, was sold to two venture capital companies, under the new parent company Clarivate Analytics.

In 2022, Clarivate announced that Newfold Digital purchased its subsidiary. Backed by the Clearlake and Siris groups, Newfold is a web and commerce technology provider.


## Research

According to the Markmonitor web site, it has been publishing a report called the Brandjacking Index since 2007, to assess how Internet threats affect corresponding brands. The company's annual report says that cybersquatting increased 18 percent in 2008 and "phishing attacks" rose 36 percent in the first quarter of 2009.

In 2010, the company estimated that $200 billion in revenues is lost annually as a result of worldwide counterfeiting and piracy on the Internet. The 2011 report said the company had identified 23,000 listings "for clones, suspected counterfeits, or gray market" versions of tablet computers by 8,000 sellers. A 2011 opinion piece in Techdirt criticized the research methodology of Markmonitor's report.
