## History

The company was established in 1992 as a joint initiative of Fred Broers and Eric van Velzen.

As a tribute to an old Babylonian God they chose Nebu (God of writing and wisdom) as their company's name.

Nebu published two cooperating software systems which are called Dub Knowledge and Dub InterViewer. The prefix Dub relates to the Babylonian word for a clay tablet that the god used to write down the destiny of the people.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Apart from these main products, numerous other tools were developed over the years and added to the packages. All of their names also start with 'Dub'.

Nebu currently employs 40 staff members as of 2015 with a revenue of over $3 million in the same year.

Nebu now has over 150 licensed users of their software including companies in the Market Research Industry and governmental organizations.
