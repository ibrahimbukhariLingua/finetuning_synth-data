## Career


### Stroymontazh

In 1994, when Polonsky was 22, he founded Stroymontazh LLC with his longtime friend Artur Kirilenko.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Stroymontazh was a construction and real estate firm set up with the initial intention of selling apartments that they had plastered and finished. However, when the building owners ran into financial difficulty, they began to pay the pair in apartments. It was through these means that Polonsky and Kirilenko took control of their first unfinished building, starting them on the path to being property developers. In 1996 the company took its first contract job, completing an apartment project in St. Petersburg for a company called Lenenergo. "The house had an area of 22,000 sq. m. That year, the entire Leningrad region finished, probably less. I thought they would thank me, but the woman who came to take over the house refused to take it for another six months for various reasons. We did it only by a miracle," Polonsky said for forbes. By the end of the 90s, Stroymontazh was one of the largest players in the St. Petersburg real estate market.

It was during the 1998 Russian financial crisis, however, that Polonsky and Kirilenko began to achieve huge financial success. According to *The New York Times*, by paying construction costs in rubles and selling property in dollars they were able to profit in the lag time between construction and sale as the value of the rouble fell.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The company rapidly amassed wealth and made a name for itself as one of Saint Petersburg's largest developers, eventually building Petrovsky Fort, a 540,000-square-foot complex that became the standard for business centers in the former capital.

Polonsky opened an office in Moscow in 2000. Two years later, Mayor Luzkhov appointed him as an adviser. Polonsky was not yet 30.


### Mirax Group

In 2004, the Moscow branch of Stroymontazh was renamed "Mirax Group" and in 2006, split from Stroymontazh, the Saint Petersburg branch, with Polonsky at the head of Mirax and Kirilenko at the head of Stroymontazh. Both men maintained 10% ownership of the other's company until 2009 when they each sold their respective stakes.

Mirax carried out projects in Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Cambodia, United States, Montenegro, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Vietnam, France. At its peak in the late 2000s, Mirax Group's assets amounted to more than 12 million square meters of real estate, with 2008 revenues estimated at $1.65 billion and net profits of $616.4 million. Some notable projects are outlined below.

Identified as Moscow's first skyscraper, the Federation Tower is recognized as the tallest building in Europe.

The towers have 4.5 million square feet of high-end office space, luxury apartments, shops, restaurants, and a 44-story Grand Hyatt hotel. A spire was to be also built which would have extended the complex's height to 450 meters (1,476 feet) as well as provided an observation deck, but it was never completed and was dismantled afterward.

In 2009, The Federation Tower won the FIABCI World Prix d’Excellence Award (Office Category Winner).

## 2008 economic crisis and restructuring into Potok

In 2008, Polonsky was the first developer who openly admitted that the Russian real estate market was affected by the 2007–2008 financial crisis. According to Anton Chernigovsky, who wrote the article "Polonsky Makes a Demarche" published in the *Business Magazine*, "his competitors kept arguing zestfully that real estate was the last thing to be threatened by the crisis. But in as early as two months, they had to withdraw their words and start to urgently suspend their projects and patch up financial gaps".

The downturn hit Mirax Group hard; in August 2008, Polonsky published an open letter in his blog, where he said that during the previous year, Mirax Group could not receive any credit to continue construction and had not sold any real estate over the past few months. Commissioning deadlines, therefore, needed to be reviewed and extended.

On 10 October 2008, Sergei Polonsky announced that he would eat his tie if the elite apartments' prices did not rise by over 25% in 1.5 years. The forecast came true with a half a year delay, and on 31 May 2011 Polonsky ate a piece of a true tie at *Minaev LIVE*, a TV show hosted by Sergey Minaev.

In July 2009, Alpha Bank acquired all of Mirax Group's debt obligations to Credit Suisse and called in the company's debts in an effort to bring the company to bankruptcy and take control of it. Polonsky described the steps taken by Alpha Bank as 'premeditated systematic actions aimed at divesting and acquiring' the corporation's assets adding that Mirax Group had been 'completely unready for the sudden turn of events.'

In February 2011, Sberbank of Russia (Savings Bank of the Russian Federation) decided to grant Mirax Group a $373 million credit for six years. On 3 March 2011, at a media conference, Sergey Polonskiy declared that the Mirax Group Board decided to liquidate the Mirax brand. He also promised to fulfill all the obligations of the Group to complete the projects and repay the debts. In May 2011, the works at the unfinished projects were resumed.

On 1 December 2011, Polonsky renamed his company "Potok", and this company inherited all the structures and liabilities of the former Mirax Group.

On 6 July 2012, by virtue of the shareholders' agreement, Polonsky bought out the shares of the minority shareholders of the "Potok" (Flow) company and became the owner of Potok's 100% block of shares.


## Kutuzovskaya Mile takeover and embezzlement charges

One notable project to stall as a result of the economic crisis was the Kutuzovskaya Mile residential complex. Polonsky became involved in the project through Mirax in 2005 at the request of the Moscow Mayor Resin Rosltak. The project had been started in 2002 by FTsSR (Federal Centre for Social Development), a company with many political connections but little experience in developing real estate. Mirax took control of the project and agreed to give FTsSR 5% of the finished apartments. Mirax proceeded to invest 2.5 billion rubles in developing the project before work was forced to stop in 2009.

FTsSR terminated the contract in January 2010. Polonsky claimed this was done unlawfully, leading to disputes between FTsSR and Mirax Group. However, according to FTsSR, funding from Mirax Group had stopped. In September 2011 FTsSR forcibly took control of the site using a private security firm. Polonsky has described FTsSR's actions as a raid in the media. "At this very moment the Project site, located at the construction site of the residential quarter Kutuzovskaya Mile, is being forcibly taken over", the company said in an official statement. To protest against the actions of the Moscow authorities, Polonsky declared a hunger strike and continued to provide his round-the-clock presence at the construction site. The Moscow Chief Directorate of the Ministry for the Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation stated at the time however that "the police stayed uninvolved in the conflict." and that the law enforcement officers present at the scene were there to "maintain public order".

Subsequently, in September 2012, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) began investigating Polonsky in relation to the Kutuzovskaya Mile project. Prosecutors claimed that between 2007 and 2008, Polonsky, through Mirax Group subsidiaries Avanta and Concordia Asset Management, took 5.78 billion rubles in down payments from 80 individuals hoping to buy apartments. They claimed that contractual obligations were not fulfilled and the funds were illegally diverted by Polonsky to other Mirax Group entities. In June 2013, the MDV charged Polonsky in absentia with embezzlement. Polonsky strongly denies any accusations of wrongdoing and has expressed his willingness to be investigated as he believes that "no legal offense has been committed."

According to the Russian publication *Novaya Gazeta*, the Kutuzovskaya Mile issue has become a "bottomless pit of internet folklore". Polonsky maintains that he transferred 2.5 billion rubles to FTsSR prior to the termination of their contract, which would have been more than sufficient to meet the contractual obligations entered into by his companies. He added that the remaining funds had not been diverted out of the project and had stayed within Mirax Group. In an open letter dated 2 October 2013 Polonsky admitted to "incompetent management" and expressed his willingness to pay $12 million in compensation to his creditors. He also sought to assure all investors that their apartments would be completed.

The embezzlement charges, Polonsky believes, are part of an attempt by FTsSR and the Moscow government to take the Kutuzovskaya project away from him and hand control to Arkady Rotenberg, a rival property developer with close ties to the Russian president Vladimir Putin


## Arrest in Cambodia

In late 2012, Sergei Polonsky and two other Russians – Konstantin Baglay and Alexander Karachinsky – were arrested by the Cambodian police. They were suspected of unlawfully depriving several Cambodian seamen of their liberty.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Polonsky protested at the arrest and the conditions of his incarceration, writing on his blog "After being detained, none of the detainees, including myself, was allowed to make a telephone call, we were denied our right to a counsel for legal assistance and to an interpreter, although the law of Cambodia provides for these rights. At present, they are holding me in a cell without an air conditioner at a temperature exceeding +35 degrees Celsius in the shade and with horrible sanitary conditions. According to the Cambodian counsels and interpreters, they regularly receive threats and warnings not to work with me from unknown people." He also made several petitions to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; however, they failed to take any steps to help.

Polonskiy also had strong relationship with King of Cambodia. Businessman was investing into the economy of the country and helping people.

K. Baglay and A. Karachinsky were released from custody uncharged on 11 March 2013 and Polonsky was released on bail on 3 April 2013.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 15 May 2015, Polonsky was arrested again in Sihanoukville, where authorities said he had been living for two years with an expired visa, which was not true at all. After it was officially proven that Polinskiy had valid visa. Cambodian Authorities has deported this fugitive Russian tycoon living illegally after he was accused of embezzling $175 million in his homeland. He was put on a flight to Moscow via Vietnam on Sunday morning.


## Interpol and extradition to Russia

On 14 October 2013, at the request of the Russian authorities, Polonsky was issued with a "red notice" by Interpol and on 7 November 2013 the Russian Prosecutor's Office sent Cambodia an official request for Polonsky's extradition. Polonsky was subsequently detained. However, on 14 January 2014, the Phnom Penh Appeal Court ruled that the grounds given by Russia for Polonsky's extradition were insufficient.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

New charges were brought against Polonsky in February 2014 and sent to Cambodia. However, on 16 April 2014, the Supreme Court of Cambodia ruled that Cambodia does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, and so Polonsky could not be extradited on any grounds.

Polonsky was eventually deported from Cambodia and sent back to Moscow on 17 May 2015.

A Moscow court had scheduled his trial date for 11 October 2015.

On 12 July 2017, the court found Polonsky guilty on two cases of major fraud and embezzlement, deciding he should face five years in prison. However, the court ruled the crime constituted a business dispute and Polonsky would only face punishment for the "non-fulfillment of contractual obligations". Plonskiy was released in the courtroom.


## UK High Court case against Alexander Dobrovinsky

On 7 May 2014, Polonsky filed a lawsuit at the UK High Court against his former lawyer, Alexander Dobrovinsky. Polonsky claimed that Dobrovinsky, along with his colleague Natalia Levinzon, the London-based law firm Dobrovinsky, and Partners LLP helped steal £300 million from him by pretending that he was negotiating a sale of his company, Potok, to Roman Abramovich whilst Polonsky was detained in Cambodia. Dobrovinsky, a known advocate of numerous Russian oligarchs, was in fact, it transpired, selling the business to Roman Trotsenko, an existing shareholder in Potok, with whom Polonsky had previously refused to do business. Polonsky claimed he had received only a few million dollars of the hundreds of millions he says he is owed, and alleged that the lawyers were acting for Mr. Trotsenko all along.


## *Neulovimiye* film

In March 2015, Polonsky announced plans for a $1 billion lawsuit against U.S. filmmaker 20th Century Fox because of similarities between himself and a villain in one of the studio's films. *Neulovimiye* ("Elusive"), a Russian-language movie released in 2015 by 20th Century Fox, has a primary character named Sergei Polyansky who kills a young woman with his car and displays many negative character traits. In addition to having a similar name, film critics have acknowledged similarities in physical appearance between the real-life Polonsky and the fictional Polyansky. The lawsuit has yetʷʰᵉⁿ? to be filed.


## Politics


### Presidential candidacy

Polonsky expressed interest in running for President of Russia in the 2018 Russian Presidential Election. Polonsky was nominated by an initiative group made up of 520 activists on 24 December. He filed registration documents with the CEC on the same day. Polonsky's documents were rejected because the initiative group did not have enough members. In addition, his past criminal conviction prevented him from becoming a candidate.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ At the same time, Polonsky announced the creation of a political party "For All" with which he intended to participate in 2021 legislative election, and will run for President in 2024. However, the party did not participate in the 2021 election, and changes to the Russian constitution in 2020 barred Polonsky from running for president in 2024 due to him obtaining Cambodian citizenship.

## Space travel

In 2004 Polonsky prepared for a spaceflight to the International Space Station, completing a full cosmonaut training course.
