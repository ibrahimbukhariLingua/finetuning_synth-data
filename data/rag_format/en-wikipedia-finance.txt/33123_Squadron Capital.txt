## Background

Squadron Capital was established in 2006. The firm is a subsidiary of Search Investment Group, a Hong Kong-based private investment firm established by Robert Warren Miller in the early 1970s. The founding professionals, led by David G Pierce, were previously employees of Search Investment Group, at which they managed the Group's private equity funds and direct investments portfolios.
