# Bodman PLC



**Bodman PLC** is a business law firm headquartered in Ford Field, located in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Founded in 1929 by two former Ford Motor Company lawyers, Wallace R. Middleton and Clifford B. Longley, the firm is one of the state’s largest, with more than 160 lawyers in four offices: Ann Arbor, Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Troy.

Bodman has long been known for its close associations with the automotive and financial services industries and for its long-term relationships with significant clients. For example, the firm has maintained a continuous client relationship with members of the Ford family since 1929 and with Comerica Incorporated since it assisted in the formation of Manufacturer's National Bank, which later merged with Comerica, in 1933. The firm represents more than 80 financial institutions in Michigan and across the U.S. as well as Tier-1, -2 and -3 automotive suppliers and OEMs on a national and international basis.
