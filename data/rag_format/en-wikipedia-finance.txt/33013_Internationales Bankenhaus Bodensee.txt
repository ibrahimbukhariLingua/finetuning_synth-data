The bank is known to be leading in credit financing of soccer clubs, with almost half of all the first and second league clubs being on the bank's customer list.


## History

The bank was founded in 1996 under the leadership of the *Landesbank Baden-Württemberg* and the *Vorarlberger Landes- und Hypothekenbank*. Through merging the market shares of the *Landeskreditbank Baden-Württemberg*, the LG and the *Südwest LB* to the LBBW, the ownership of the *Landeskreditbank* was passed to the LBBW. Due to the integration of the BW-Bank and the following reorientation, the LBBW sold its shares in 2005 and 2006 to the *Würth-Gruppe*, which held 88.55% of the *Internationales Bankhaus Bodensee AG* shares until 2009. In spring 2009 the *Würth-Gruppe* bought the 1.45% of shares the management had held up until that point, increasing shares to 90%.
