# Wörwag Pharma



**Wörwag Pharma** is a medium-sized family-owned pharmaceutical company headquartered in Böblingen, Germany with subsidiaries in Asia, Europe and South America. It was founded in 1971 by pharmacist Fritz Wörwag in Stuttgart. It sells prescription and over-the-counter preparations and food supplements.

Wörwag Pharma specializes in biofactors, which include vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.


## History


### Foundation

The city pharmacy was founded in 1965 in Zuffenhausen, a district of Stuttgart. In the early 1970s, the owner Fritz Wörwag started producing and selling his own pharmaceutical products, which was the basis for the founding of Wörwag Pharma in the adjacent building of the pharmacy in 1971. The company's first micronutrient preparation was *Magnerot Classic* for the treatment of magnesium deficiency. To accelerate the development of the business, the company was converted into a corporation in 1977. In 1985, the product range was expanded to include the drug *Milgamma* with the active ingredient benfotiamine, a prodrug of vitamin B1.


### Internationalization

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Wörwag Pharma focused on the newly opened market in Eastern Germany and continued to expand in the direction of Eastern Europe. In 1993, a branch opened in Hungary – the first international site outside of Germany – and later, other branches in Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia, Russia, and Central Asia were added. Wörwag Pharma focused its production on vitamins, trace elements and generic drugs. Since then, Wörwag Pharma has also been present in Asian and South American countries, for example, in Vietnam and Peru.


### Further expansion

In 1996, Wörwag Pharma relocated its head office from Stuttgart to Böblingen. In 2001, the two children, Marcus Wörwag and Monika Wörwag, took over management of the company from their father. They continued the expansion course of Wörwag Pharma and concentrated primarily on biofactors. They spun off the generics business in 2015 into the independent subsidiary AAA-Pharma. In January 2019, Marcus Wörwag moved from the management to the advisory board, where he continues to shape the strategic direction of the group. In 2021, Monika Wörwag also withdrew from the management and has since been Director of Corporate Communications. In April 2021, Wörwag Pharma acquired the Polish company Sensilab, a contract manufacturing organization based in Konstantynów Łódzki, and thus came into possession of its first own production facility for pharmaceuticals. Since then, pharmaceuticals have been produced here for the company's own needs and in contract manufacturing under the new name *Wörwag Pharma Operations*.


## Products

Wörwag Pharma offers medicinal products in the four categories diabetic concomitant diseases, nervous system, immune system and musculoskeletal system. Wörwag Pharma refers to the products it sells as "biofactors". Overall, the company's product range includes 26 biofactor brands in Germany. Magnerot and Milgamma are still two significant brands in Wörwag Pharma's product range.
