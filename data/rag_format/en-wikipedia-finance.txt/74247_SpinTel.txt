# SpinTel



**SpinTel** is an Australian-based telecommunications company that mainly provides residential/business broadband, 4G and 5G connectivity and home phone packages. It was founded as Spin Internet services in 1996, by Peter Stevens in Sydney, Australia.


## History

Established in 1996 in Sydney, under the name of Spin Internet services, it focused mainly on providing dial-up internet locally. In 2002, Spin Internet services launched ADSL services which had recently become available on the Australian market. In 2007, Spin Internet services signed a wholesale deal with Optus and Telstra to resell bundle DSL services. From 2008, Spin Internet provided 3G mobile handsets and mobile internet plans. In 2011, it reverted to only selling mobile broadband and mobile airtime. In 2011, Spin Internet changed its name to Spintel, to better reflect the company's approach to telecommunications. In 2012, sister company Comcen merged with SpinTel, transferring all of its users. In 2014, SpinTel launched an NBN service bundle.


## Controversy

In 2015, it was discovered that SpinTel has accidentally removed the unlisted classification of more than 400 silent numbers, which led them to be listed in both online and offline public number directories. SpinTel notified the affected users and issued an offer to change the numbers to unlisted ones.
