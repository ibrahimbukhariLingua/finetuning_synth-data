## Lawsuit

During her tenure at Welspun India, the company faced a major setback when the US retail corporation Target terminated all its contracts with Welspun due to a dispute over cotton supply. Target alleged that the bedsheets supplied by the company were falsely labeled as Egyptian cotton and that another type of non-Egyptian cotton was substituted during production between August 2014 and July 2016 without Target's knowledge. Subsequently, Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond also ceased their partnerships with Welspun. This led to a 54% decline in Welspun India's market capitalization between August 19, 2016, and August 30, 2016.
