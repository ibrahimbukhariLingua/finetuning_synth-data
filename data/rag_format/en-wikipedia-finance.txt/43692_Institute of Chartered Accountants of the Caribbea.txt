Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean


# Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean



The **Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean** (ICAC) is an association of accounting organizations in the Caribbean region that promotes professionalism and standards of best practice in the region.


## Purpose

The ICAC was incorporated as a company on October 28, 1988 under the laws of Jamaica.
Aims are to promote international standards for best accountancy practices, to build a strong and cohesive Accountancy profession, and to encourage exchange of ideas and information between accountants who belong to the member bodies.
The ICAC supports self-regulation based on a regional monitoring program, and encourages standardization of qualifications and professional conduct rules.
The institute seeks to give leadership on issues that affect the accounting profession in the region.


## Activities

Following the meltdown of Enron at the end of 2001, ICAC came under increasing pressure to improve oversight of the accounting industry.
In July 2003 ICAC was planning to introduce a regional practice-monitoring system to enhance the regulatory capacity of the profession.
After several corporate failures during the Great Recession, ICAC announced a scheme in November 2008 under which all members of the accounting Institutes in Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago who performed audits would receive at least one monitoring visit during the six-year period starting in 2009.
As of 2009, all Caribbean islands that are part of ICAC had to undergo peer review except Jamaica, which was regulated by a public accountant oversight board.
ICACs emphasis on self-regulation and peer review has been criticized, since it is difficult to guarantee independence with the small numbers of professional accountants in each member state.

In 2006, ICAC was helping its member institutes to prepare for the Caribbean Single Market (CSM).
The ICAC 2011 annual meeting, held in the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in Kingston on 23â€“25 June 2011, attracted about 1,000 accountants from across the region.
