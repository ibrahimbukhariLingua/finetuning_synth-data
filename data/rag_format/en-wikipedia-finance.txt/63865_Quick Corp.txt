## Services

Quick developed one of the three major Japanese real-time news database services in the 1980s (along with Jiji News Wire and Nikkei Telecom).

Quick is responsible for calculating several Japanese financial market indices, including the well-known Nikkei 225 stock market index. Quick also publishes "Quick Consensus" data based on corporate earnings and macroeconomic forecasts published by securities firms and analytics companies.

In 2016, Quick introduced AI-based technology to automatically "read" corporate news releases and instantly generate news reports based on the contents. In the same year, Quick announced a strategic equity investment in the US fintech startup Xignite, which provides cloud-based market data to financial institutions, with the goal of offering the technology to customers in Asia.
