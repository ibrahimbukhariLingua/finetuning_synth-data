ICS Building Society was bailed out in 2008 onwards due to the economic downturn. The brand, broker network and a performing book of mortgage loans with a value in the region of €223m was sold by Bank of Ireland in 2014 to Dilosk DAC after the European Commission ruled that, due to Irish mortgage market requirements placed on Bank of Ireland, it had to dispose of ICS in order to maintain competition.(https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2014/0901/640755-ics-building-dilosk/) The sale went ahead unusually, without apparent approval required of society savers and the building society in tandem, was wound up in time for the sale and transfer of its some of its loan book etc. (http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ics-building-society-savers-have-been-shortchanged-30531376.html).
