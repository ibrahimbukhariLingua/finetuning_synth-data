## History

During the 2018 ASEAN summit, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi called on businesses to invest in Myanmar. She delivered a keynote speech, inviting foreign entities to invest in the country’s priority sectors (including agriculture, food processing, fisheries, export promotion, import substitution, energy, logistics, education, healthcare and construction), saying that investing in Myanmar will bring good returns to both investors and the nation.

Htun Htun Oo, Union Attorney General, made a proposal to the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw for the formation of a new ministry on 12 November 2018. As there was no disagreement, Pyidaungsu Hluttaw Speaker announced the establishment of the new ministry. It was formed by combining the Foreign Economic Relations Department, Directorate of Investment and Company Administration of the Ministry of Planning and Finance.

Due to the ministry's creation, the number of ministries in the cabinet rose to 25.
