Slovak Economic Association


# Slovak Economic Association



**Slovak Economic Association** (SEA, Slovak: Slovenská ekonomická spoločnosť) is an association of professional economists in Slovakia. It was formed on 26 June 2010 at the Bratislava Economic Meeting conference.

Since 2008, the association has organized annual conferences. Notably, in 2017 the Nobel Prize winner Robert F. Engle gave a keynote speech at the SEA conference in Košice.

In 2018, the Association started awarding a bi-annual award to a Slovak economist under 40 years of age for an outstanding contribution to economic research and evidence-based policy making in the country named after Martin Filko.

SEA is a member of the International Economic Association.
