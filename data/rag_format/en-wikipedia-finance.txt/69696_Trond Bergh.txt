**Trond Bergh** (born 16 September 1946) is a Norwegian economic historian, and researcher at the Department of Innovation and Economic Organisation of the BI Norwegian Business School.


## Life and work

Bergh was born in Tvedestrand, and took the cand.philol. degree at the University of Oslo in 1973.

Bergh was the director of the Labour Movement Archive and Library from 1989 to 1999, and was then employed at the Centre for Business History and, later at the Department of Innovation and Economic Organisation of BI Norwegian Business School.

With the latter work Bergh became involved in a legal case. Former secretary of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs Haakon Bingen sued Bergh and Eriksen as well as the publishing house Cappelen Akademiske Forlag, because the second volume of *Den hemmelige krigen* contained information that portrayed Bingen as a close friend of communist Peder Furubotn. In late 1999 the Supreme Court of Norway found that this was not true, and circulation of the book was forbidden, until the reference to Bingen had been amended. Bingen was also entitled to 146,975Â kr of costs.
