Transdev


# Transdev



**Transdev**, formerly **Veolia Transdev**, is a France-based international private-sector company which operates public transport. It has operations in 17 countries and territories as of November 2020.

Transdev was formed on 3 April 2011 via the merger of Veolia Transport and Transdev S.A., being initially equally owned by Veolia Environnement and Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC), the former soon announced plans to divest its holding in the business. Early priorities of Transdev were to largely focus upon its four core markets (France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States) while disposing of its less profitable ventures based in most other countries to consolidate. At the time of merger, Transdev operated in 27 countries to varying extents. During January 2019, Veolia sold on its remaining 30% shareholding in Transdev to the Rethmann Group; the company has since integrated some of its subsidiaries with those of Transdev.


## History

Transdev was formed through the merger of Veolia Transport and Transdev on 3 April 2011. Veolia Environnement and Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC) had 50% shareholdings. It was initially planned for the company to be sold by an initial public offering, potentially accompanied by a rebranding, within 12 months of the merger.

On 6 December 2011, Veolia Environment, seeking to reduce debt and focus on its core businesses of water, waste and energy, announced a €5 bn divestment program over 2012/13 that would include a sale of its share in Veolia Transdev within two years. At the time of the announcement, Veolia Transdev declared its intention to concentrate on four main markets (France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States), to develop its presence in the United Kingdom, Asia and Australia and to divest from other countries and other activities amounting to about 9–10% of global revenue in 2012/13. After this announcement, the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations, for its part, officially reiterated its commitment to Veolia Transdev and its continued support as a shareholder to the group's development.

During early 2012, it was reported that Cube Infrastructure, a fund controlled by the French bank Natixis (Groupe BPCE), was likely to acquire about half of Veolia's stake in Transdev. The Caisse des Dépôts would take over the other half. In October 2012, this was later changed to Caisse des Dépôts acquiring 10% of the shares from Veolia. However, this reported acquisition was not implemented. Following the sale of Transdev subsidiary SNCM in late 2015, CDC and Veolia continued talks about selling Veolia's stake in the joint venture. In December 2016, CDC finally bought 20% shares from Veolia. As a result, Veolia's share became 30% while CDC's share became 70%.

In October 2018, Veolia announced its intention to sell its remaining 30% shareholding to the Rethmann Group. The transaction was completed during January 2019, with Rethmann increasing its shareholding to 34% by adding its Rhenus Veniro subsidiary to the Transdev portfolio.

In December 2024, it was announced that Rethmann Group planned to increase its shareholding to 66% with Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations' to reduce its to 34%.


### Operational history

At the time of merger, Transdev operated in the following 27 countries. In 2014, the operations at the time were organised into seven geographical areas (struckthrough countries' operations have already ceased):

* France
* Benelux (Netherlands, ~~Belgium~~)
* North America (US, Canada)
* Germany and Central Europe (~~Croatia, Poland~~, Czech Republic, ~~Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia~~)
* The UK and Northern Europe (~~Finland~~, Ireland, Sweden)
* Asia and the Pacific (Australia, ~~China~~, ~~South Korea~~, ~~India~~, New Zealand)
* Southern Europe and the rest of the world (Chile, Colombia, ~~Israel~~, Morocco, Portugal, Spain)

In 2013, CEO Jérôme Gallot confirmed that Veolia Transdev would consolidate its operations down to 17 countries. As of November 2020, Transdev operates in 17 countries spanning across five continents. The list only counts sovereign countries and therefore excludes New Caledonia (France). Jersey, a British Crown dependency and Hong Kong (China), were previously also not counted for the same reason. Veolia Transdev (and Transdev) operated MyBus operations until 2012 and Hong Kong Tramways until 2020 respectively.

Additionally, Transdev is a shareholder of Transamo, a transport engineering and consultancy firm in Europe that was inherited from the old Transdev. It specialises in the project management of public transport projects in France. Société de Transports intercommunaux de Bruxelles (STIB) is the other major shareholder of Transamo.


## Europe


### Czech Republic

In December 2018, Transdev commenced operating a 10-year contract in the Moravian-Silesian Region serving Bruntál, Krnov, Nový Jičín and Rýmařov. Transdev had previously operated buses in the Czech Republic until they were sold to Arriva in May 2013 (see Central Europe section below). During August 2019, Transdev acquired the 3CSAD Group that also operated in the Moravian-Silesian Region with 410 buses to become the fourth largest bus operator in the Czech Republic.


### France

Transdev's subsidiary Société Varoise de Transports (SVT) has operated two lines of the Bouches du Rhône district network since 1 January 2014, serving a population of more than one million inhabitants.

Transdev also operates many Hérault Transport bus lines in the south of France, and the Montpellier tramway system.

Transdev owned 66% of SNCM, a French ferry company operating in the Mediterranean. However, as of 2014, Transdev was planning to sell its shares. SNCM was finally sold to a Corsican firm Rocca Group in late 2015 and was renamed Maritima Ferries in January 2016.

Thello (see Italy section) operated trains between Italy and France; Transdev relinquished its 33% holding in 2016.

Prior to April 2019, Transdev owned Eurolines who operated coach services around Europe. In July 2015, Eurolines commenced operating 17 coach routes under the Isilines brand to coincide with the deregulation of the French coach market. Eurolines and Isilines were sold to Flixbus in April 2019. Transdev retains Isilines' B2B bus rental activities in France, which will be operated under the Transdev brand.

The shared-van service SuperShuttle operated in the country, but it was sold to an affiliate of Blackstreet Capital Management in September 2019, after which it ceased service at the end of 2019 citing that Uber and market changes led to its demise. The SuperShuttle brand and technology was purchased in March 2020, and operates as SuperShuttle Express focusing on economical private rides, black car and SUV, and private vans/Sprinters for large groups.


### Ireland

Transdev Ireland (known as Veolia Transport Ireland until May 2013) has operated Dublin's Luas tram system since 2004. In June 2019, Transdev was awarded a new contract to operate and maintain the system for another six years, effective 1 December 2019, with an option for a five-year extension.


### Germany

In November 2018, Transdev was awarded a contract to operate the regional railway network of Hannover; the deal, which covers approximately 9.3 million rail kilometres per year and typically carries in excess of 30 million passengers annually, was valued at in excess of €1.5 billion and is the largest regional rail contract in the history of Transdev Germany to date.

During January 2019, Rhenus Veniro was added to Transdev's German portfolio as a result of Rhenus's parent company, Rethmann, increasing its shareholding of Transdev to 34%.

### Portugal

Transdev Portugal operates bus and coach services all around Portugal, and formerly light rail. It was first established in 1997 to tender for the Metro do Porto light rail through the consortium Normetro. The light rail opened in 2002 and was operated by Transdev Portugal until 2010. Transdev Portugal also acquired the CAIMA Group in 2002 and the Joalto Group in 2010. It was rewarded the AveiroBus network with 24 buses, 1 ferry boat and 2 boats, effective from 1 January 2017.

The shared-van service SuperShuttle operated in the country, but it was sold to an affiliate of Blackstreet Capital Management in September 2019, after which it ceased service at the end of 2019 citing that Uber and market changes led to its demise.


### Netherlands

Transdev Netherlands is made up of two operations, Connexxion and Witte Kruis. There used to be an additional operation called Veolia Transport Nederland, until the branding was discontinued and replaced by Connexxion during December 2016. Transdev Netherlands was set up in December 2015 to group the three operations together under one brand, after bringing Connexxion and Veolia Transport Nederland under one management earlier in May that year. Each operation continued to exist separately with its branding unchanged until the rebranding of Veolia Transport Nederland. This arrangement was planned ever since the global rebranding of Veolia Transdev in 2013.

During October 2007, Transdev acquired a 50% shareholding in Connexxion. In February 2013, Transdev's shareholding increased to 86%.

Veolia Transport Nederland operated bus, train and ferry services around Netherlands since 1997. During December 2016, the last remaining concession of Veolia Transport Nederland was rebranded to Connexxion. Witte Kruis (Dutch for White Cross) is Transdev's mobile care organization in Netherlands.

#### Former UK operations

Arrow Light Rail, a consortium between the original Transdev, Nottingham City Transport, Bombardier Transportation, Carillion, Galaxy and Innisfree, was contracted to build and operate the Nottingham Express Transit for 30.5 years from 9 March 2004. However, the contract was terminated in 2011 when Tramlink Nottingham (a Keolis consortium) was selected as the preferred bidder for the construction of Phase 2 of the light rail and operation of the network. The last day of operations of Arrow Light Rail was 16 December 2011, few months after the establishment of Veolia Transdev.

The old Transdev used to own London Sovereign and London United, two of the 20 bus operators serving London, up to the merger with Veolia Transport during March 2011. Veolia Transdev took over London Sovereign from the old Transdev until it was sold to RATP Group in April 2014. Veolia Transdev never took over London United, instead it passed to RATP.

During June 2016, Transdev sold their share in the venture to Trenitalia, giving the latter full control of Thello.
