In the United States, Technology Management was deemed an emerging field of study by the Department of Education and received a new Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) code in 2020. The Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE) accredits collegiate programs in technology management. An instructor or graduate of a technology management program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting an exam administered by ATMAE covering production planning & control, safety, quality, and management/supervision. The ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree technology management programs.
