## History

On Wednesday, 29 April 1942, an enormous explosion of ammonium nitrate destroyed the entire Produits Chimiques de Tessenderloo factory and much of the surrounding town of Tessenderlo. In the incident, 189 people died and more than 900 were injured. The factory was later rebuilt in the same place, a very controversial decision.

In 2015, Tessenderlo merged with Picanol.
