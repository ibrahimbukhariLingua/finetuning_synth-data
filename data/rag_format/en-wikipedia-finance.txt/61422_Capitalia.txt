Capitalia


# Capitalia



**Capitalia** was an Italian banking group headquartered in Rome, in existence between 2002 and 2008. The bank was a listed company in Borsa Italiana (Milan Stock Exchange). The bank was acquired by UniCredit by issuing new shares of UniCredit for shares of Capitalia.


## History

Capitalia was formed on 1 July 2002 in a merger of Banca di Roma (and its subsidiary Banco di Sicilia and Mediocredito Centrale) and Bipop Carire (and its subsidiary Fineco). In the same year the bank sold 10 branches from Apulia, Campania and Molise regions to Banca Popolare di Puglia e Basilicata.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Capitalia in turn agreed to be taken over by UniCredit in May 2007, becoming part of the second-largest bank in the European Union by stock market value and the sixth-largest in the world.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Merger with UniCredit

In May 2007, plans were finalized for the buyout of Capitalia by its larger Italian rival, UniCredit. All banks of the Capitalia group in Northern Italy will be reconfigured as UniCredit banks; in turn, all Unicredit banks in the rest of Italy will be reconfigured as either Banca di Roma banks (rest of mainland Italy and Sardinia) or as Banco di Sicilia banks (in Sicily only).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
