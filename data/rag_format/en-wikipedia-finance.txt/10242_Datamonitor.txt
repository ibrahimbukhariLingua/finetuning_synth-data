## History

The company was founded in 1989 by Mike Danson and Doug Wilson, with its first report covering the UK Frozen Food Industry. The company then expanded its coverage to include a number of markets and industries, having secured further business intelligence companies. In 1995, it expanded into the U.S. market by opening an office in New York. In 1999, it opened an office in Frankfurt, Germany, and Hong Kong. In November 2000 Datamonitor went public on the London Stock Exchange.

In 2007, Datamonitor was acquired by Informa (FTSE: INF) in 2007 for £513 million in cash, a surprisingly large amount considering it was "a multiple of more than seven times Datamonitor’s revenue". In 2011, Informa closed down Datamonitor offices in Hyderabad, India, and Dubai,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ which had been opened in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In February 2015, parent company Informa wrote down Datamonitor's value of by almost 40%, and Informa CEO Stephen Carter said that it was considering selling "some of the 'consumer forecasting' businesses that were part of the Datamonitor deal".

On 27 July 2015 Progressive Digital Media, a business chaired by Datamonitor founder Mike Danson, announced that it had agreed to acquire Datamonitor Financial, Datamonitor Consumer, MarketLine and Verdict businesses from Informa for a combined cash price of £25m. Datamonitor Healthcare and Datamonitor Energy remained businesses of Informa plc.

In 2022, Informa sold its Pharma Intelligence division, including Datamonitor Healthcare, to Warburg Pincus. The business was renamed Citeline. Later in 2022, Citeline was acquired by Norstella.
