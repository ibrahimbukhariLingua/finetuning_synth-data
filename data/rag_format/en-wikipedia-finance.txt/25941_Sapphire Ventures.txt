## History

The firm was founded in 1996 as the venture capital arm of multinational software conglomerate SAP and spun out as an independent company in 2011, rebranding to **Sapphire Ventures** in 2014. At the time, Sapphire Ventures managed $1.4 billion and had invested in more than 125 companies, with 10 companies going public and 17 getting acquired.

In 2012, the firm launched **Sapphire Partners**, a real-time fund making investments in early-stage venture capital funds based in North America, Europe, and Israel. The strategy also includes direct co-investing alongside Sapphire Partners' GPs.

In 2015, Sapphire partnered with technology companies Cisco Systems and Siemens to co-host the first industry summit on the Internet of Things, named *"IoT: Empowering The Enterprise"* in San Jose, California. Sapphire had been an investor in Control4, an IoT company which completed its initial public offering in 2013.

In 2019, the firm launched **Sapphire Sport,** a fund dedicated to backing companies at the intersection of sports, media, and entertainment. Backers of the fund included Manchester City's City Football Group (CFG) alongside owners, investors, and family offices from the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Soccer (MLS). Later in 2019, Sapphire Ventures re-launched #OpenLP, a community to foster idea sharing, open dialogue and overall greater connectivity among entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and limited partners (LPs). That year, Sapphire also raised $1.4 billion across investment strategies, including a $150 million opportunity fund to support larger deals.

In 2021, the firm raised $1.7 billion in February and an additional $2 billion in November across multiple investment strategies, with its assets under management surpassing $8.8 billion. This increase in capital also allowed the firm to expand its Portfolio Growth capabilities. Later that year, Sapphire made a major expansion in Europe and appointed Annalise Dragic as partner, making Dragic one of the youngest female venture capital partners in Europe.

In 2022, Sapphire Ventures joined the board of the National Venture Capital Association with one of the firm's partners, Beezer Clarkson serving from 2022 through 2026. The firm additionally became the official sponsor of PitchBook's podcast.

In early 2023, the firm announced a new $181 million fund for Sapphire Sport.
