Eclipse ERP


# Eclipse ERP



**Eclipse ERP** is a real-time transaction processing accounting software used for order fulfillment, inventory control, accounting, purchasing, and sales. It was created for wholesale distributors in the Electrical, HVAC, Plumbing, and PVF industries, but is used by a wide range of market sectors. At one point this software was called **Intuit Eclipse DMS**, and **Activant Eclipse**, and **Eclipse Distribution Management System**.

The backend runs on a NoSQL UniVerse database from Rocket U2.


## History

Before Eclipse ERP was created in 1990, distributors mainly in the North-East used SHIMS (Supply House Information Management System) that was owned by Ultimate Data Systems. Development of Eclipse ERP started in 1990 by Eclipse Inc.; the original team consisted of Clark Yennie, Michael E. London, David Berger, Steven Grundt, and Richard Montegna. In 2002, Eclipse Inc was sold in 2002 to Intuit for $88 million.

Activant bought Eclipse ERP on August 17, 2007, for $100.5 million in cash. Apax Partners merged Epicor and Activant on April 5, 2011. Thus Epicor became the owner of Eclipse ERP. Over the years Eclipse ERP was operating under numerous brands.


## User interface

Client stations connect to the Eclipse server via an Eclipse terminal emulator called **Eterm** and/or a thick, Java based, **Solar Eclipse** client. Solar Eclipse was introduced in version 8.0 in May 2004, and replaced with version 9.0 in May 2015.


## Key features


### Usage scenarios

Typical users are distribution companies, members of trade associations, with multiple regional branches and hundreds of employees. Typically these companies employ outside salesmen who travel. Inside salespeople provide support to customers over the phone or email. Distribution center personnel use Eclipse ERP as a Distribution Center Management System. They do order picking, order processing, maintain inventory in stock, and send products to customers via shipping carriers. Accounting department deals with general ledger, AP, AR, and credit control. Marketing department is responsible for online and printed promotional material. Purchasing department deals with procurement from manufacturers and vendors in the supply chain. These business processes must be adjusted to work specifically with Eclipse ERP. The cost of the software depends on the numbers of concurrent user licenses and the number of companion products.
