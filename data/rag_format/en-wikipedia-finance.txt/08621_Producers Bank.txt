## History

Producers Bank was established as **Rural Bank of San Jose City (Nueva Ecija), Inc.**, on August 2, 1995. Through the vision of its founder, Mr. Andres M. Cornejo, the bank continued to gain steam when it was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 23, 1995.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), then granted its Certificate of Authority on November 17, 1995, which allowed the Bank to officially start banking operations on November 27, 1995.

Producers Bank today is the result of several business combinations in the last twenty one (21) years that involved twenty four (24) banking institutions, including the following:

* In July 2019, the bank took over Banco Dipolog when it acquired ninety-nine point ninety-eight percent (99.98%) stock from owning company PBCom.
* In April 2024, the bank acquired Leyte rural bank. The bank would absorb all the assets and liabilities of the rural bank located in Southern Leyte.
