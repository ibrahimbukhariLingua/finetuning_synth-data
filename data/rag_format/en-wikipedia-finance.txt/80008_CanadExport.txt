## History

Published in both English and French, *CanadExport* was founded in 1983 by what was then known as the Department of External Affairs and International Trade. Originally, the publication was printed and distributed twice monthly free of charge to some 50,000 Canadian subscribers.


### Online publication

In 1996, the *CanadExport* website was created to allow for online content and in 2007 became a 100% online publication. Now as the official e-Magazine of the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service (TCS), it is delivered electronically to over 17,000 Canadian subscribers.

In keeping with the online revolution, the e-Magazine has made changes to its format with the introduction of podcasts, videocasts, and webinars, that feature international business trends and opportunities for Canadian businesses. These productions include interviews with key business and government leaders who have amassed expertise in how to succeed internationally and how to avoid costly mistakes.
