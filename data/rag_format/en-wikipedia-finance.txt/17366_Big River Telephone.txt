# Big River Telephone



**Big River Telephone Company, LLC** is a telecommunications company located in the Midwestern United States. Big River Telephone is classified as a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and is a wholesale digital provider of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services to the cable industry.


## History

Big River Telephone began in 1984 as LDD, Inc. LDD was primarily a long distance telephone service provider until The Telecommunications Act of 1996 opened the communication market. After this, LDD started competing for local telephone service.

In 2001, independent investors acquired the assets of LDD, Inc. The former LDD image was phased out and the company took a new look and approach to the telecommunication industry as Big River Telephone Company, LLC. Over the next several years, Big River Telephone acquired several small local Internet service providers, including one of the leading ISPs in the area, Clas.net. Big River also acquired Cascade.net in 2005 and Atprs.net in 2008.

Big River Telephone's service platform took a technological leap after their Voice over Internet Protocol local switching network was established in 2004. This new approach allowed Big River Telephone to deliver regular telephone service with enhanced features as well as high speed Internet and other advanced data services to small businesses and residential customers. The completion of the VoIP local switching network assisted in the implementation of a new product called Integrated Communications Exchange (ICE). The ICE technology combines high-speed data with voice signals over the same connection minimizing the number of wired connections.

Big River Telephone is providing VoIP services to cable providers across the United States.

## Other projects

Big River Telephone is actively working to provide Advanced Wireless Services, also known as AWS-1, a wireless telecommunications spectrum band used for mobile voice, data services, video, and messaging. AWS-1 is used in the United States and replaces the spectrum formerly allocated to Multipoint Multichannel Distribution Service, sometimes referred to as wireless cable. The FCC has divided the spectrum into hundreds of rural licenses—rather than a handful of licenses that span large geographic areas—making it easier for smaller providers in remote cities and towns to bid. Big River Telephone Company acquired a band on the federal license Advanced Wireless Spectrum in 2007 with the intention of serving the counties where the majority of their customers are. Those counties are Bollinger, Cape Girardeau, Madison, Perry, St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve, Washington and Wayne.

On August 4, 2010, Big River Telephone was announced as the recipient of $24.4 million in American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funding to extend high-speed Internet service to seven Missouri counties in southeast Missouri. The counties to be served are Bollinger, Cape Girardeau, Madison, Perry, St. Francois, Ste. Genevieve and Washington counties. The network deployment, which will provide access to 44,697 households and 7,511 businesses, was applauded by Governor Jay Nixon, who on August 5, visited the company to hold a press conference announcing the funding. Big River expects to add 75 people when work on the broadband build out is complete.
