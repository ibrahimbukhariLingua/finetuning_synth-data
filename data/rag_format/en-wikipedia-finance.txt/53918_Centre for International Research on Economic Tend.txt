Centre for International Research on Economic Tendency Surveys


# Centre for International Research on Economic Tendency Surveys



The **Centre for International Research on Economic Tendency Surveys** (CIRET) is a forum of scientists and institutions who analyse the development of business cycles and their effects on economic and social issues, specifically by means of Economic Tendency Surveys. It was founded in 1960 and is located at the KOF Swiss Economic Institute, ETH Zurich. The current president is Jan-Egbert Sturm.


## Aims

According to its statutes CIRET is a non-profit organisation with a scientific purpose. Its aims are:

* "to contribute to the international development, conducting and use of business and other economic surveys of enterprises and consumers" and
* "to develop, encourage and improve communication, exchange, contacts and cooperation among national and international suppliers and users of [such] surveys"

In practice CIRET follows a broader definition of its own scopes, which it describes as being a "forum for leading economists and institutions concerned with analysing and predicting the development of the business cycle and the economic and socio-political consequences. At the same time they also consider the outcome of economic tendency surveys which usually contain questions relating to quality".


## Members

As of January 2018, according to CIRET's own accounts 55 national institutions (universities, statistical offices, national banks, public and private research institutes) from 32 countries are represented among the members of CIRET as well as several international organisations like the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.


## Conferences and workshops

CIRET describes its conferences as the "main event[s] among the association's activities." They are held every other year since 1953. At recent conferences between 65 papers (Hangzhou, 2014) and 115 papers (New York, 2010) have been presented. Among the keynote speakers of recent CIRET Conferences were the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul A. Volcker (New York, USA, 2010), David F. Hendry (Vienna, Austria, 2012), Bruno S. Frey (Vienna, Austria, 2012), M. Hashem Pesaran (Hangzhou, China, 2014), and Lucrezia Reichlin (Copenhagen, Denmark, 2016).

Since 2008, the Fundação Getulio Vargas awards the Isaac Kerstenetzky Award at the CIRET conferences in three categories: Lifetime Award (formerly Scholarly Achievement Award), Best Paper Award, and Young Economists' Best Paper Award. The award aims at "promot[ing] research on economic developments possibly using data gained from business and consumer tendency surveys" and has been donated in honour of Isaac Kerstenetzky, a Brazilian economist who started the first Business Tendency Survey in South America.

CIRET Workshops have been established in 2009 and are held in the years without a CIRET Conference. The workshops are smaller compared to the conferences and follow narrower, more specific topics.
