First Data announced the sale of 17,000 Clover Stations six months after the release of the product. This put Clover ahead of Square Stand in terms of total units shipped.

On September 9, 2014, Clover announced its work with Apple to support Apple Pay via its Android POS Platform. Clover described the functionality in a blog post that was featured on the home page of Hacker News.


### Second hardware product

Clover announced its second hardware product, the Clover Mobile, at the Money 20/20 conference in November 2014. On March 19, 2015, Clover Mobile] won the gold medal for the Best POS innovation at the PYMNTS.com Innovator Awards ceremony. Clover Mobile features a complete EMVCo compliant payments solution with an on-screen pin-pad, that is fully PCI PTS 4.0 compliant. It also features an EMVCo compliant Contactless payment interface which enables it to support Apple Pay among other contactless payment modes. The device has an ergonomic handle with an integrated barcode scanner - with an external wireless mobile printer accessory designed to keep the device lightweight and reduce fatigue.


### Third hardware product

Clover's third hardware product, the Clover Mini was launched by First Data on June 16, 2015. Like Clover Mobile, Clover Mini is a PCI PTS 4.0 approved, EMVCo compliant contact and contactless next generation payment device. Clover Mini has a built-in receipt printer and is designed to be a terminal replacement with the support for advanced payments interfaces, while also allowing Merchants to install apps from the Clover App Market. Clover Mini also features a USB hub allowing easy interface of peripherals such as external barcode scanners, cash drawer and a Merchant keypad (for cases where the Mini is Customer-facing).


## Acquisition

On December 28, 2012, Clover entered into a merger agreement with First Data Corporation. In a radio interview with Wharton professor Rahul Kapoor the structure of the acquisition was explained. An operating agreement was put into place whereby Clover would receive $100M in funding to run independently. First Data would be responsible for sales and support, while Clover built all new payment hardware/software for the company. The deal utilized a "Founder's Clause" that would trigger a very large penalty payment if the parent company interfered with operations of Clover. Thirty two months after the acquisition Clover was mentioned 88 times in the S-1 filed by First Data Corporation. Clover is now owned by Fiserv through the acquisition of First Data Corporation. As of May 1, 2024, Clover raised basic plans over 1000% for users via a forced updated Software terms and agreement. Long time customers who purchased software embedded equipment before 2019, are now being charged for software that was contractually "free" based on original customer acquisition agreements. Several law firms are planning class action suits on behalf of customers as they are now locked out of their accounts unless they agree to new terms and an absurd increase in plan pricing. Clover and Fiserv have refused to buy back the software embedded hardware of impacted customers.
