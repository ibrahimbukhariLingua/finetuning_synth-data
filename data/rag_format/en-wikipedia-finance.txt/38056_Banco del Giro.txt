Banco del Giro


# Banco del Giro



The **Banco del Giro** (Venetian: *Banco del Ziro*), also **Banco Giro** or **Bancogiro**, sometimes referred to in English as the **Bank of Venice**, was a public bank created by the Republic of Venice. It was governed by a magistrate called the *Depositario*.


## History

An early proposal for a *banco per Comune*, a public municipal bank that would complement the operation of Venice's private banks, was made to the Venetian Senate by Senator Giovanni Dolfin in 1356. A comparable proposal was made again in 1374 by a committee headed by Michele Morosini.⁴³ In 1587 the Republic founded the **Banco della Piazza di Rialto** to allow easy transactions' settlement without handling of metallic money.

The *Banco del Giro* was established in 1619 and its administration was entrusted to the Senate, which appointed the *Depositario* from among its members. In 1637, the *Banco di Rialto* was merged into the *Banco del Giro* following financial difficulties.

The bank ceased its activity in 1800, following the fall of the Republic, and was finally liquidated in 1806 under the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
