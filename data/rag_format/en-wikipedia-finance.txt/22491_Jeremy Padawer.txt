## Early career

In 1996, Padawer developed a network of transactional toy and gaming websites. Padawer "gamed" the Yahoo search engine using simple naming strategies. By naming each one of his collectible websites starting with two A's, Padawer's sites would come up first in search. Advertisers included Disney, Onsale.com, and Amazon.com. Most notably, Newsweek followed Padawer's tracking of the plunge in Beanie Baby valuations in 1998–1999 on Padawer's AbsoluteBeanies.com.

Padawer is an early domain name investor. Padawer's sale of www.act.com to Symantec stands as one of the largest domain name transactions in history. Padawer purchased hundreds of generic .com domain names from 1996-2000 including his own first name (Jeremy.com), his city (PacificPalisades.com). Padawer utilized direct navigation traffic, aggregating hits for advertising dollars.

In addition, Padawer developed DomainAppraiser.com, a site that advised thousands of domain name holders on valuation (1999–2001), and Schmuck.com, an online monthly with material by amateur humorists and users (1998–2000).
