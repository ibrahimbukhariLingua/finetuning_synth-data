He has a B.A in history from Notre Dame and an M.A. in history and M.B.A. with a concentration in finance from the University of Pittsburgh.

From 2015 to 2022, he was the Samuel C. Johnson Professor in Sustainable Global Enterprise at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. He was an associate editor of *Administrative Science Quarterly* from 2014 to 2020.


## Books

Marquis's first book *Better Business: How the B Corp Movement is Remaking Capitalism*, was published in 2020 by Yale University Press. The book focuses on the ways in which entrepreneurs and companies can effectively shift from a shareholder- to stakeholder- orientation by reforming their governance and accountability systems.

*Better Business* has won many awards and recognitions including runner-up in the *Financial Times* Responsible Business Education Awards and the Axiom Business Book Awards Gold Medal in Business Ethics. It was also a finalist for Porchlight Books Business Book of the Year and a winner of the Responsible Research in Management Award. The book was listed on the *Financial Times* Top Business Books in October and, following publication in the UK, the *Spear*'s magazine list of four best reads out in January, which called it a "prescient book when capitalism in its current form is coming under question."

*Mao and Markets* was published in 2022 by Yale University Press, and shows that the conventional wisdom that guided Western engagement with China for 40 years – that as markets opened, the country would become more liberal – was wrong, and also provides an important perspective on how China will be governed in the future.

The *Financial Times* recognized Mao and Markets as a Best Book of 2022 and it won a Gold Medal from the Axiom Business Book Awards. It was a finalist for the George R Terry Book Award from the Academy of Management. *Mao and Markets* was profiled in feature articles in *The New York Times* and *The Guardian*. Martin Wolf, the Financial Times chief economics commentator said about Mao and Markets that "many western observers believed that China was moving towards free market capitalism and hoped that it would become more democratic as a result. (...) This important book shows that such beliefs and hopes were always naïve." Lingling Wei, the chief China correspondent for the Wall Street Journal praised Mao and Markets as "an important book at a crucial time for China's economy."

Marquis’ third book, The Profiteers: How Business Privatizes Profit and Socializes Cost was published in 2024 by PublicAffairs. The Profiteers offers not only a critique of the many ways companies shift their social and environmental responsibilities to the public, but also details a number of solutions for how businesses can be more sustainable and equitable and the pioneering companies who are doing so.

The Profiteers was listed a Top Business Books in May, 2024 by the *Financial Times* and one of the Top 24 Business Books of 2024 from the Next Big Idea Club. Publishers Weekly described the book as an “impassioned exposé…The result is a galvanizing call to rein in corporate malfeasance,” and Kirkus Reviews said The Profiteers is “a forceful argument for genuine business accountability.”


## Academic research

Marquis's research in academic journals examines the interactions between corporations, government bodies, and society, and how these interactions can lead to socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes. In recent years, he has focused on how these processes unfold in China. His earliest research developed the idea of how organizations and institutions can be imprinted by their initial context.
