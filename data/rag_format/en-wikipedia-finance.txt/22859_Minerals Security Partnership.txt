Minerals Security Partnership


# Minerals Security Partnership



The **Minerals Security Partnership** (MSP) is a transnational association whose members seek to secure a stable supply of raw materials for their economies. The MSP is composed of 14 countries and the EU: Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union. Members profess a commitment to high Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) standards.


## History

According to the inaugural announcement made at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada convention in June 2022, the goal of the MSP "is to ensure that critical minerals are produced, processed, and recycled in a manner that supports the ability of countries to realize the full economic development benefit of their geological endowments."

India was inducted into the MSP in June 2023. Estonia joined the MSP in early March 2024.


## Activities

The governments of Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia met with the MSP members at Investing in African Mining Indaba on 7 February 2023.


## Criticisms

The head of the Alaska Miners Association on 1 November 2022 said that "I worry that the MSP will prompt decision makers within the federal administration to prioritize mining in other countries in an attempt to walk a line between getting the minerals we must have but not developing ones in America under the name of conservation."
