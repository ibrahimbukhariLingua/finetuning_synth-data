# Autzu



**Autzu** is a transport tech corporation, headquartered in San Francisco.


## History

Autzu was founded in 2017 and began operations in Toronto through a partnership with Uber in 2018. The following year, it expanded to New York City.

Autzu and Uber build up the Partnership for EV Driveshare program. This collaboration provides Uber drivers with the opportunity to Drive EVs (i.e.Teslas) on an hourly basis.

John Gabriel is the founder of Autzu.

By focusing on savings in vehicle operation and manufacturing, Autzu offsets a total annual CO2reduction of 36.53 metric tonnes per vehicle. At a fleet of 1,000 vehicles, that impact grows even larger: the reduction in CO2emissions would be 36,530 metric tonnes annually.
