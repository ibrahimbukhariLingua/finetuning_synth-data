## History

The university was established on August 21, 1958 by combining three provincial schools which trained party cadres in economics, management, marketing, supply chain management, and other necessary skills for government service. The new institution was named the Guizhou College of Finance and Economics (贵州财经学) and was based in the Hebin District of Guiyang, where the university continues to maintain a campus.

During the Cultural Revolution, the institution was forced to suspend operations. It was re-established in 1978 and admitted its first class of undergraduate students that year.

In 1992, the College absorbed the provincial party cadre training school for economic planning.

In 2002, the institution relocated most of its facilities from its Hebin campus to a new campus in Luchongguan District, and granted its first master's degree in 2004.

On June 15, 2012, after approval from the Ministry of Education, the institution held a ceremony and changed its name to the Guizhou University of Finance and Economics.

In 2013, the university began moving facilities and students to a state-of-the-art campus in Huaxi University City, a new district in Guiyang that had begun construction in 2011.

The university began to pursue more international partnerships in 2012 with the establishment of a joint undergraduate finance program with the Edinburgh Napier University, a public university in the United Kingdom. In 2015, the university established its Western Michigan Institute, an undergraduate college in collaboration with Western Michigan University, a state university in Michigan, United States. Gui Cai also maintains programs in accounting, financial insurance, marketing, and logistics management policy jointly organized with Berkeley College, a for-profit college in New Jersey, United States.

In 2018, the university was authorized to grant its first doctoral degrees.
