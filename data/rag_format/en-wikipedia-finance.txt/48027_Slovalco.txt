# Slovalco



**Slovalco** is a large Slovak metallurgical company that produced 160,000 tonnes of aluminium and alloys per annum.

In 2022, Slovalco laid off most of its 450 employees, citing high energy costs. Instead of concentrating on primary aluminium production, the company re-oriented to remelting with an expected annual output of roughly 75,000 tons. In January 2023, the company shut down the remaining 10 cells, ceasing aluminium production in the city after almost 70 years.
