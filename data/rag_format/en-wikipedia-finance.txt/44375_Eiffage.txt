# Eiffage



**Eiffage S.A.** (French pronunciation: [ɛfaʒ]) is a French civil engineering construction company. As of 2010ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ it was the third largest company of its type in France, and the fifth largest in Europe.


## History

The company was formed in 1992 through the merger of several long standing companies, namely: Fougerolle (founded 1844), Quillery (founded 1863), Beugnet (founded 1871), and La Société Auxiliaire d'Entreprises Électriques et de Travaux Public, better known as SAE (founded in 1924).

The company often teamed up with other businesses for various purposes. During 2009, the British company Carillion teamed up with Eiffage to jointly pursue work in the nuclear sector. Six years later, Eiffage joined with Carillion and Kier Group to pursue work on the UK's High Speed 2 project. In 2016, the firm and the Australian firm Macquarie Group purchased a 46.1 percent stake in the French A41 autoroute concession ADELAC for €130m. Eiffage and the Italian oil services company Saipem were jointly awarded work valued at €350 million by BP on the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim Field.

Eiffage has acquired other businesses on numerous occasions. In 2013, it acquired five companies of the bankrupt Smulders Group. One year later, it bought a 70 percent stake in the Canadian business Innovative Civil Constructors Inc. In 2018, Eiffage bought the Swiss construction company Priora. During the early 2020s, it acquired several Dutch companies, including Harwig, Eltra, and Ven den Pol Elektrotechniek. During early 2024, it purchased the German business EQOS Energie.

The company has routinely pursued substantial opportunities in the green energy sector, including the construction of hydroelectric dams, wind and solar farms. Furthermore, acquisitions made by the company have expanded its presence in this sector. Eiffage has also been involved in several sustainable construction developments, such as the building of the largest timber tower in France.

Throughout the early 21st century, the company has progressively increased its stake in Getlink, the owner-operator of the Channel Tunnel. In October 2022, it was announced that Eiffage has become the largest shareholder of GetLink by increasing its stake in the firm to 20.76 percent.
