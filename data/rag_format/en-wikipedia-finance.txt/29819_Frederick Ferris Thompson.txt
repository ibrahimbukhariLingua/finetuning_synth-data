# Frederick Ferris Thompson



**Frederick Ferris Thompson** (June 14, 1836 – April 10, 1899) was a prominent American banker and railroad president who co-founded the First National Bank and what is now Citibank. He was also an early amateur photographer and a noted philanthropist.


## Early life

Thompson was born in New York City. He was the son of Electa Ferris and John Thompson, a banker and publisher of *Thompson's Bank Note Reporter*.

Thompson attended Peacham Academy in Peacham, Vermont. Next, he went to Columbia College where he joined the Fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall).

He then attended Williams College from 1852 to 1854. While there, he founded the *Lambda chapter* of the Fraternity of Delta Psi. He left Williams after his sophomore year to go to Europe on business at his father's request in 1854. However, he did return to college, but did not graduate. He wrote, "I was only a quondam member of ’56, of two years’ presence in college, and a thorn in the side of the faculty of that day. Good old President Mark Hopkins gave me a special graduation certificate afterward, just to show that I was not kicked out of college..."


## Career

Thompson, his father, and his older brother Samuel C. Thompson founded their first bank called Thompson Brothers in 1857. In 1863, the trio opened their third bank, called the First National Bank of the City of New York—this was the first national bank under a new federal system. Thompson served as its vice-president and the bank grew to be the second largest in New York City. This bank survives as Citibank.

In 1873, John and Samuel Thompson left the First National Bank to form the Chase National Bank, named after their friend and the US Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase. As a result, Thompson became president of First National Bank.

In May 1884, First National Bank was drawn into a financial scandal, causing the Marine National Bank to fail. Grant, Ward & Co., who owed $77,000 to the Marine Bank, wrote three checks totaling $210,000 on a non-existent account from First National; the Clearing House for processing checks had cleared the checks, leaving Thompson with a $210,000 shortfall. This is nearly $6.2 million in today's money. First National went to court for a resolution as the check were processed the day the Marine Bank closed.

Thompson also founded and was president of the National Currency Bank of New York and started the First National Bank of Detroit, and the Columbia Bank in Chatham, New York.

On September 3, 1885, he was one of three incorporators of The Graphic Mining & Smelting Company in Chicago Illinois with $300,000 capital stock. That same year, he was a founding trustee of the American Electric Railway Company of New York. The company had $1 million in capital to build locomotive engines and cars.

In January 1888, Thompson was one of four investors who bailed out the failing Montgomery & Florida Railway (aka the Alabama & Florida Railroad). In August 1888, when the New York Elevated Railroad merged with the Manhattan Railway Company, Thompson was elected president of the new corporation.

In May 1894, Thompson was also elected to the board of the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua which was involved with the Nicaragua Canal project. The company had sold more than $22 million in stock in 1894. He became chairman of the company in 1898. Despite being incorporated by Congress, the Maritime Canal Company received no federal funding and ultimately defaulted on the project in 1899 because of lacking funds and the instability of Nicaragua.


## Philanthropy

Thompson and his wife donated large sums of money to numerous organizations, including the American Geographical Society, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Union League, and the Williams College Alumni Association. He was key to the construction of the Ontario Orphan Asylum and buildings for the Teachers College, Columbia University.

At Williams College, he donated a clock tower to Lasell Gymnasium in 1886. He donated the forty-acre Tallmade Farm to Williams College in 1887. In June 1888, he gave a challenge gift of $25,000 to construct a $100,000 memorial to Dr. Mark Hopkins, provided alumni donated the balance needed. The resulting Mark Hopkins Memorial building contained a library, art gallery, offices, and a room for lectures and recitations. In 1891, he offered to build a new library at his own expense. In 1895, he donated $175,000 for the construction of the Thompson Laboratories. In 1895, he donated $5,000 toward the construction of a new infirmary. He also supported scholarships, the Thompson Fund for lectures, and the annual Thompson Entertainments. At the time of his death, he was the most generous donor in the history of Williams College.

in 1898, the New York Times noted that "Mr. Thompson is a veritable fairy godfather to [Vassar] college." In 1887, Thompson donated $20,000 toward Vassar College's goal of a $200,000 endowment. When Vassar's new gymnasium opened in 1894, it had marble-lined, heated swimming pool, provided by Thompson. At the time, this was the largest swimming pool at any college gym in the country. He also donated $200,000 for a new library addition which was designed by Francis R. Allen. Opened in 1893, this three-story brick building featured Warsaw stone trim and a Tennessee marble staircase. Officially named the Frederick Ferris Thompson Annex Library, was also called "Uncle Fred's Nose."

He was affectionally known as "Uncle Fred" to the Vassar students, not just for these large gifts, but for making gifts that added to the students' comforts and learning experiences. In 1890, he donated $1,500 to set up an emergency fund to provide short-term, interest-free loans for Vassar students. He donated funds for the annual senior picnic each June. He provided a rocking chair for each girl's room, along with nice furnishing for the college's infirmary. He also sponsored the annual outing to Lake Mohonk for Vassar's freshmen and seniors—about 300 students in total—providing transportation, hotel accommodations, and meals. The freshmen from the class of 1902 sent him a thank you telegram saying: "Frederick F. Thompson, New York: Mohonk is grand and so are you: Accept the thanks of nineteen-two." He also gave each graduating student a silver spoon "as a symbol of his hope that she will be fortunate in the world."

Thompson served on the board of Williams College, Vassar College, Teachers College Columbia University, the New York Dispensary, the Ontario Orphan Asylum, and the Women's Hospital. He also served on the central council of the Charity Organization Society of the City of New York. The society distributed more than $22 million in 1887.

In June 1898 when Clara Barton sent an appeal to the newspaper to help the American National Red Cross' hospital ships serving the Americas in the Spanish-American War, Thompson was one the nine to become an immediate donor, giving $500.
