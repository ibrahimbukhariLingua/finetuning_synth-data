## Ideas and theories

Choudary is best known for his work on the transition of business models from pipelines to platforms. He first proposed this idea in a 2013 article for Wired magazine. The idea, gained widespread adoption after his 2016 article on this topic was selected by Harvard Business Review among its top 10 ideas of the year. Choudary is also credited with proposing the idea of the core interaction as the central focus of value creation on platform business models, presented in his books Platform Scale and Platform Revolution. Choudary's work on the transformation of incumbent businesses to platform business models has been widely quoted in media. His recent work explains the importance of platform economics in manufacturing, heavy industry, healthcare, and financial services. Choudary credits game design theory as one of the inspirations for his work on platform design.

Choudary's work with the International Labor Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization also highlights the conflicts between platforms and their ecosystem participants. In a 2023 Financial Times feature profiling his ideas, Choudary stresses on the ideas of 'control points' to manage platform relationships with the ecosystem.

For his work on platform economics, Choudary has been hailed as a 'global thought leader on the platform business model' by Forbes, a 'top global thinker' by the Huffington Post and a 'leading expert on the so-called platform economy' by the United Nations' WIPO. Choudary has also been featured twice in the Thinkers50 lists for his ideas and theories and has been featured on the Gen T List by Tatler, a British high-society and fashion magazine, for his work on "preparing global industries for an uncertain future".


## Impact on public policy

Choudary has worked with several governments and policy makers in Europe to help them develop competitive and regulatory responses to global platforms entering Europe. Choudary's work champions the use of digital public goods for societal and national development.

Choudary has been a prominent advocate of individual rights in the platform economy and has worked extensively with several international bodies, including the United Nations, on this topic. His research on worker exploitation by labor platforms was released by the International Labor Organization as part of their Future of Work Research Paper Series. In November 2017, Choudary addressed a high-level seminar by the Permanent Mission of Belgium in Geneva, highlighting the factors that lead to exploitation of workers on digital platforms.

In February 2018, Choudary addressed the Parliament of Denmark on labor policy for the platform economy, stressing on the need for a new data-driven regulation paradigm for platforms. His recommendations for regulating platforms through open data sharing were instrumental in informing the Danish government's decision to implement open data regulation for Airbnb in May 2018. In September 2018, Choudary's framework also informed the set up of the world's first collective agreement between a platform company and a trade union, again in Denmark.

Choudary's research on the adverse impact of platforms on the creative economy was featured as a keynote at the annual global conference of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). His recommendations advocated the role of the WIPO as a standards setting organization in a platform economy, for protection of creator interests.

Choudary's research also looks at readiness of countries moving into the platform economy. In partnership with Standard Bank, Choudary has also co-authored a paper on the rise of the platform economy in the African continent.

Choudary's work on digital trade includes a future positioning paper for countries like Singapore that is widely considered a blueprint for Singapore's strategy for digital trade. The paper suggests that countries can adopt a platform strategy and establish free data ports to harness digital trade flows.

In November 2020, in the aftermath of the 2020 US elections, Choudary's research on China's strategy for technology export and dominance was published through the Brookings Institution, a leading American think-tank, to inform the incoming Biden Administration on possible policy responses.
