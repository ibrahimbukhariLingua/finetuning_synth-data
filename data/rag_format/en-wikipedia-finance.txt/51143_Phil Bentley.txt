Bentley's stewardship was often controversial, as the company raised residential energy prices several times during his reign; protests at company premises were not unusual. Bentley frequently appeared in the media defending the company's decisions. The controversy was fuelled by the rise in profits during Bentley's stewardship – profits from the residential energy division of British Gas increased by 24% in one year alone. Bentley repeatedly claimed that price rises were beyond the company's control, and that they were not increased to raise profits. Bentley said that the reason for the price increase was that average domestic gas consumption had increased by 12 per cent compared to the warmer previous year.
