### Author

Sherman has written 26 books on the legal and strategic aspects of business growth, mergers and acquisitions, capital formation, and the leveraging and licensing of intellectual property. His latest book, *The Crisis of Disengagement*, discusses the multifaceted workplace dilemma of disengagement, and examines how apathy and complacency effects leadership and governance, company culture, peers and team members, and individuals.

His book *Harvesting Intangible Assets* uses the metaphor of farming to describe innovation and leveraging intellectual property. Characterizing a company's role as that of an "intangible asset agrarian", he provides instructions for planning, planting, nurturing, cultivating, preparing to harvest, and ultimately selling a "bumper crop" by fully leveraging intangible assets and intellectual property. Sherman discussed these ideas in his Tedx Talk in January 2014.

His first non-business book, *Road Rules: Be the Truck. Not the Squirrel.* applies the metaphor of commuting to work in your car to driving down the road of life. Sherman discusses his inspiration and motivations for the book on The Connections Show audio podcast. In September 2009, he released a special Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) edition of *Road Rules: Be the Truck. Not the Squirrel.* with a foreword by MADD National President Laura Dean-Mooney; 40% of the proceeds of its sale (at www.bethetruck.com) go directly to MADD.
