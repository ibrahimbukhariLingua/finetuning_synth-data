## History

Peter Gaffney and Ben Cline, both petroleum engineers working in oil and gas in South America, found they both shared a dream to have their own consultancy. They believed that the oil and gas industry could benefit from independent technical and management expertise, such as suggestions on how to improve production, where to drill and how to be more efficient. In 1962 they founded Gaffney, Cline & Associates (GaffneyCline) in Trinidad, establishing offices in Houston, London, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Sydney and Russia.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In the mid 1960s, GaffneyCline expanded into the United Kingdom with a view to use the rapidly developing North Sea as a springboard for growth. Further expansion in Singapore would follow in the late 1960s to capitalize on growth in crucial Asia Pacific markets (particularly Indonesia), which had become focus investment areas for major and independent oil companies. The late 1970s would see GaffneyCline increase market penetration throughout the Americas and internationally in every major hydrocarbon region around the world.

Since 2008, GaffneyCline has been a subsidiary of Baker Hughes.
