The Royal Canadian Pancake Houses


# The Royal Canadian Pancake Houses



**The Royal Canadian Pancake Houses** were moderately priced gourmet pancake houses in New York City and in the South Beach area of Miami Beach, Florida.


## Development

The Royal Canadian Pancake Houses were owned by **Royal Canadian Foods Corp**, a Delaware corporation. The first outlet opened in Tribeca in New York City, in 1989. It was followed by the opening of a second location in Midtown Manhattan. In November 1993, the founders, Sheldon Golumbia and Beatrice Puja, took it public with a micro-public offering of 250,000 shares of common stock at a sale price of $5.00/share.
Subsequently, two more locations were opened in NYC, in the Upper West Side and Gramercy. In Miami Beach, Florida, Royal Canadian Foods also opened a Royal Canadian Pancake House and a Womlette House, featuring “womlettes” (an omelet with a waffle base).

In fall 1998, Royal Canadian Foods closed all of their outlets.
