## History

In 1939, Orient Paper was established in Brajarajnagar, Odisha. Later, Orient Paper became India's largest paper company. In 1946, National Engineering Industries (NEI) was founded, followed by the acquisition of Neosym, previously known as Indian Smelting & Refining Company, in 1947.

In 1948, Braj Mohan Birla started the operations of Hindustan Motors, an automotive company that he founded in West Bengal. Known for producing the Ambassador car, widely used as a taxicab and government limousine, Hindustan Motors held the position of India's largest car manufacturer until the rise of Maruti Udyog.

Under Ganga Prasad Birla's leadership, the group ventured into project management by acquiring the three-million-tonne Ajaokuta steel project from the Nigerian government, which was facing operational challenges at the time. This move triggered further initiatives, such as the modernization of integrated steel plants owned by the state-operated Steel Authority of India Limited in Durgapur and Rourkela.

The group's technological footprint expanded with the acquisition of Switzerland-based ASSAG in 2013 and EnablePath in 2014 by Birlasoft.

* In 2023, NBC Bearings, a CK Birla Group' company filled the gap in Russia's bearing imports after Western manufacturers ceased sales following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This halted operations at key tank factories like Uralvagonzavod and Omsktransmash. To overcome the shortfall, the company stepped in and accounted for 38.4% of Russia's imports, totaling $12.3 million from April 2022 to March 2023. The Ukrainian government's National Agency on Corruption Prevention included the company on its "War & Sanctions" portal as International Sponsors of War, specifically naming key management figures: Rohit Saboo, Sanjiv Taparia, Gaurav Chaturvedi, Shailesh Patni and Rajan Jain.
