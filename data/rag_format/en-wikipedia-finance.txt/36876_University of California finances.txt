# University of California finances



The University of California public university system is funded through both public and private money. Some funds are given directly to each of the system's 10 campuses, while the rest are distributed through the central UC Office of the President. Support given by the state of California to its three-tier higher education system (comprising the University of California, California State University, and California Community College) is presented by the governor every January, and approved by the state legislature at the end of the fiscal year in June. Traditionally, the state of California has been the largest public supporter of the UC system. In response to state budget woes, UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau in 2011 made the claim that his own university is turning into a federal and not a state institution because of the inversion of the proportion of funds given by each jurisdiction since he became Chancellor in 2004.
