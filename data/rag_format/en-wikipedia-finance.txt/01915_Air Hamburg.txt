# Air Hamburg



**Air Hamburg Luftverkehrsgesellschaft mbH** (also known as **Air Hamburg**) is an open-baseᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ charter airline headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. According to its own statement, it is the "largest provider of charter business aviation in Europe".

In 2001, two entrepreneurs (Floris Helmers and Alexander Lipsky) founded Flugschule Hamburg - a commercial aviation school. In 2005, under a newly established company name, Air Hamburg, and with their single and twin-engine aircraft, they began offering regular round-trip flights to nearby areas including Germany's northern islands, such as Heligoland, Juist, Norderney and Sylt. Due to the increasing number of private charter requests, the Air Hamburg Private Jets brand was founded in 2006.

In February 2022, Air Hamburg was acquired by Vista Global Holding, the parent company of VistaJet and XOJET. Alongside Air Hamburg, Air Hamburg Technik, based at Baden Airpark, and Executive Handling, based at the Hamburg Business Aviation Center (GAT), were also acquired. The Flugschule Hamburg and Café Himmelschreiber remain in the ownership of the two original founders Helmers and Lipsky.

As of October 2023, Air Hamburg is now VistaJet GmbH.
