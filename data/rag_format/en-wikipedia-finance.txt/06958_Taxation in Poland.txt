**Taxes in Poland** are levied by both the central and local governments. Tax revenue in Poland is 33.9% of the country's GDP in 2017. The most important revenue sources include the income tax, Social Security, corporate tax and the value added tax, which are all applied on the national level.

Income earned is generally subject to a progressive income tax, which applies to all who are in the workforce. For the year 2014, two different tax rates on income apply.

In Poland, people with the highest incomes are required to pay a solidarity levy, often referred to as the third tax bracket. It amounts to 4% on annual income exceeding 1,000,000 PLN. The funds collected are allocated to the Solidarity Support Fund for Disabled Persons.


## Value added tax (VAT)

In 1993, Poland implemented its Value Added Tax system. Polish VAT is overseen by VAT acts and the Fiscal Penal Code, and is enforced by the Ministry of Finance.

Value-Added Tax applies to most trade in goods in Poland. 23% is the basic rate. Lower rates of 8% and 5% also apply for foodstuffs. Furthermore, some services are taxed at 0% tax rate or exempted from value-added tax (eg. financial and postal services).

## Income tax scale in 2017

| over 85,528 PLN | 15,395.04 PLN + 32% of the surplus over 85,528 PLN minus tax-reducing amount |

The second table is used to determine the tax-reducing amount from the tax.

| Annual income | Tax-reducing amount(amount to subtract from the tax) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 PLN - 6,600 PLN | 1,188 PLN |
| 6,600 PLN - 11,000 PLN | {\displaystyle 631.98\times (income-6,600) \over 4,400} PLN |
| 11,000 PLN - 85,528 PLN | 556.02 PLN |
| 85,528 PLN - 127,000 PLN | {\displaystyle 556.02\times (income-85,528) \over 41,472}PLN |

| 8,000 PLN - 13,000 PLN | {\displaystyle 883.98\times (income-8,000) \over 5,000} PLN |
