Economic Survey 2021-22 warned India to be wary of imported inflation. The Survey said as the wholesale price-based inflation (WPI) during the current financial year, in contrast to the trends observed in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, has shown an increasing trend, and remained high. The Survey calls for improving productivity of small and marginal farmers through small holding farm technologies. The Survey states that climate finance will remain critical to successful climate action for India to achieve its Net Zero Carbon Emission target by 2070. Crop diversification towards oilseeds, pulses and horticulture needs to be given priority, the Survey mentions. Encouraging farmers to shift from cultivation of rice and wheat to pulses and oilseeds would help ensure that the country is self-reliant in pulses and oilseeds and also assist in reducing import dependence.

The Economic Survey also warned that the new restrictions introduced across the globe due to the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus pose a threat to tourism as well as domestic passenger traffic in the near term. Vaccination is not merely a health response but is critical for opening up the economy, particularly contact-intensive services. Therefore, it should be treated for now as a macro-economic indicator.

Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal, while addressing the press, said agriculture sector, "not surprisingly, was least affected by lockdowns of various kinds". This sector grew in even 2020-21 and again in 2021–22. Industrial sector, on other hand, did go through a contraction and now it is about 4.1 percent above pre-pandemic levels, he added. India's overall GVA grew by 8.6 percent on year in 2021–22, after contracting 6.2% in 2020–21, PEA Sanjeev Sanyal said. Sanyal added that India now has $636 billion worth of forex reserves, one of the highest in the world, and equivalent to 13.2 months of imports. The principal economic advisor further said that India's spending on social services has risen to around Rs 20 lakh crore in 2021–22, whereas, the spending on education and health has risen to Rs 6.97 lakh crore and Rs 4.72 lakh crore in the same period, respectively.
