North Carolina Confederate currency


# North Carolina Confederate currency



The Confederate State of North Carolina issued currency during the years 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1864. The most recent state currency issue prior to this were the Colonial American banknotes issued during the 18th century. Many North Carolina banks also issued currency during this period.

Many of the North Carolina banknotes are similar to period issues from other Confederate States; this is not surprising, as the North Carolina banknotes were printed by many of the same printers that were used by other states.

It is estimated that the printing of approximately $11,350,000 in banknotes was authorized over the four-year period, but it is unknown how much was actually printed and put into circulation.
