## History

One Hannover Square and Two Hannover Square were completed in 1985.

Lennar Partners of Miami, Florida bought the building and its 554-space parking garage for $44.8 million in 2000.

One Hannover Plaza changed its name to One Bank of America Plaza in 2005 after Bank of America renewed its lease. Progress Energy had 155,000 square feet (14,400 m²) but was moving into a new building of its own. Other major tenants included Absolute Collection Services with66,500 square feet (6,180 m²), the City of Raleigh with 38,000 square feet (3,500 m²), and the law firm Hunton & Williams.

In July 2005, The Simpson Organization of Atlanta, Georgia bought the building for $47.1 million. At the time, it had an occupancy rate of 80 percent. When the company listed the property for sale in 2010, it was 95 percent full. Simpson made improvements including a lobby redesign, a new fitness facility, additional conference space, and renovated retail space.
