## History

WellCare began operations in 1985 in Tampa, Florida as a Medicaid provider for the State of Florida. In 1992, Kiran Patel, a cardiologist and entrepreneur, purchased the company.

In 2002, Patel sold it to a New York investment group led by George Soros and Todd Farha. Also in 2002, Todd Farha joined the company as CEO.

In 2004, it became a public company via an initial public offering. In 2006, WellCare began offering Medicare Advantage plans with prescription drug benefits after the signing of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act in 2003.

Also in 2006, WellCare began offering Medicare Part D plans.


### 2007 Florida investigations

On October 24, 2007, law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on WellCare's headquarters in Tampa, Florida–based on a whistleblower complaint that provided evidence of WellCare inflating patients' treatment costs and not returning overpayments to the state. The complaint also named several employees who knew about the activities.

In 2011, the SEC filed criminal charges against four WellCare executives. In 2013, the executives, including former CEO Todd Farha, were found guilty of the charges, including healthcare fraud and making false statements to law enforcement. Between 2008 and 2012, the company agreed to pay a total of $217.5 million to settle the claims against them.
