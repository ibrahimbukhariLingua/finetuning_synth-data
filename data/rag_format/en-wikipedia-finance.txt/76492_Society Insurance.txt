## History

In 1911, the Wisconsin legislature passed the state’s first workers compensation law. Like all other industries, farmers’ threshing crews were required to carry the coverage.

However, insurance carriers were not willing to provide the coverage at a reasonable rate. In response to that difficulty in purchasing workers compensation insurance for themselves, a collection of farm threshing crews formed what is now Society Insurance as Wisconsin Brotherhood of Threshermen Insurance Company, Limited Mutual, on June 8, 1915, in Madison, Wisconsin.

The company moved to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, in 1918.

In 1930, the company purchased Threshermen’s National Insurance Company, a Madison-area competitor.

In the early 1980s, what was still Threshermen’s began offering property and casualty insurance to businesses.

The company changed its name from Threshermen’s to Society Insurance in 1995 and expanded into Illinois, Indiana and Iowa in 1996 and 1997.
