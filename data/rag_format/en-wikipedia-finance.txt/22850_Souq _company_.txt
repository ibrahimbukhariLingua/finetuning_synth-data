## History

The website was founded in 2005 by Ronaldo Mouchawar and was originally a consumer-to-consumer auction site part of Maktoob Group. In 2010, Wisam (Sam) Daoud joined Souq from eBay as Chief Technology Officer and led the transformation of the business from auctions to a fixed price catalog based business similar to Amazon.com. In late 2012 Asif Keshodia joined as CFO on the heel of Souq's first major funding round led by Cape Town, South Africa-based Naspers and NYC hedge fund Tiger Global Management.

In March 2014, Naspers invested another $75 million in the company, bringing to $150 million the total Souq.com raised since its inception, the largest amount raised by any internet-based business in the Middle East.

The company was backed by Tiger Global Management and Naspers Ltd. as of 2015, among other companies, and headquartered in Dubai. In October 2015, it was reported that in a round of fundraising, the company was valued at around $1 billion. At the time, it had around 10 million visitors monthly in the 2nd place after Digikala with 51 million visitors monthly.

On March 27, 2017, Emaar Properties made an offer for Souq of $800 million. On March 28, 2017, Amazon.com Inc. confirmed it would be acquiring Souq.com for an unknown value. A source told *The Wall Street Journal* the deal was worth around $700 million, while the *Financial Times* reported that the deal was "understood to be worth more than $650m". The BBC also reported that Amazon might be paying about $650 million. The deal was expected to be completed later in 2017.

With the acquisition, Souq.com became a subsidiary of Amazon, acting as Amazon's arm into the Arab world. In May 2019, Souq.com UAE became Amazon.ae, and in September of the same year Amazon launched the Amazon DSP in the UAE. In June 2020, Souq.com KSA became amazon.sa. On September 1, 2021, Souq.com Egypt became amazon.eg, marking the end of Souq.com.
