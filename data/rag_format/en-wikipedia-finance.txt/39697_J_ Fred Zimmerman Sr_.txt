# J. Fred Zimmerman Sr.



**John Frederick Zimmerman Sr.** (1843–1925) was an American theatre magnate. He was one of the members of the Theatrical Syndicate, which monopolized theatrical bookings in the United States for several years.


## Early years

Zimmerman was born in 1843,
and began work in 1863 as an usher at the Chestnut Street Theater in Philadelphia.
He became an advance agent for booking shows in theaters.
Zimmerman and Samuel F. Nixon became partners in the Nixon & Zimmerman theatrical firm.
The two started as lessees of theaters, and later became owners.


## Theater operations

Nixon and Zimmerman acquired the lease of the Walnut Street Theatre from the widow of George K. Goodwin, who died in the summer of 1881.
Soon after she sold them the lease on the Chestnut Street Opera House.
They already owned Haverly's, later called the Chestnut Street Theatre, and they now dominated the theater business in Philadelphia.
By the mid-1890s Nixon and Zimmerman controlled the Broad, the Park, the Chestnut and the Chestnut Street Opera House, the four most important theaters in Philadelphia.
They also owned first-class theaters in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.


## Theatrical syndicate

In 1896 Zimmerman, Nixon, Al Hayman of San Francisco, Marcus Klaw, A. L. Erlanger, and Charles Frohman of New York joined to form the Theatrical Syndicate.
This gave them an effective monopoly in the United States of bookings of travelling theatrical companies.
The syndicate was organized as an informal pool rather than as a modern corporation, a relatively fragile structure that relied on trust and cooperation.
Eventually the Shubert brothers broke the monopoly.
The syndicate could not compete effectively with the more efficient corporate structure of the Shubert Organization.
New competition also came from movies, an increasingly popular alternative to live shows.

Zimmerman's first wife was Vesta Howard Sawtelle (1868 - 1918). His second wife was Emma A Wetherell (1850 - 1903).
He died in 1925 and was buried in the family crypt on "Millionaire's Row" at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.
His son J. Fred Zimmerman Jr. continued in the family business.
