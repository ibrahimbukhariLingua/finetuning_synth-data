List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita


# List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita



This article includes a list of countries of the world and their gross national income (GNI) (formerly GNP) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2023, as reported by the World Bank.

> "GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad."
> 
> — International Comparison Program, World Bank

> "PPP conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that eliminates the effects of the differences in price levels between countries."
> "Typically, higher income countries have higher price levels, while lower income countries have lower price levels (Balassa–Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components reflect both differences in economic outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences in price levels, the size of higher income countries is inflated, while the size of lower income countries is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume), as PPPs control for price level differences between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects the real size of the countries."
