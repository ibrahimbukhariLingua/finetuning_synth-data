The NRVY was announced by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the ramparts of the Red Fort during the Independence Day speech on 15 August 2002. The NRVY was formally launched by Vajpayee on 26 December 2002, and RVNL was incorporated under the *Companies Act, 1956* on 24 January 2003. RVNL's two main objectives are to augment the capacity of rail infrastructure and raise extra budgetary resources for special purpose vehicle projects.

RVNL opened its initial public offering (IPO) on 29 March 2019. It was the third railways-related PSU to initiate an IPO, after RITES and IRCON. The company offered a 12% stake at a price range of ₹17-₹19 per share. The IPO was subscribed 1.78 times by close on 3 April earning ₹481 crore (US$58 million).

#### Rail connectivity to Rewas Port in Maharashtara

It was important to think out of the box and find a solution as eventually the price would be heavy with respect to the curtailment of opportunities and options available to a developing nation.

From beginning with railway capacity augmentation through track doubling, new railway lines, gauge conversion, railway electrification, RVNL has moved onto working on metro railways, multimodal transport system, port connectivity, turnkey projects i.e. workshops, training institutes, green buildings, high speed rail projects, cable stayed bridges, river and road bridges, vertical lift bridge, mountain Railways and tunnels.
