**Raymond Frech Mikesell** (1913 – September 12, 2006) was an economics professor at the University of Oregon and was believed to be the last surviving economist from the Bretton Woods conference.


## Biography

Mikesell was born in Eaton, Ohio. He received a bachelor's degree from Ohio State University (OSU) and, in 1939, received a doctorate in economics from OSU. From 1937 to 1941, he was assistant professor at the University of Washington.

During World War II, Mikesell became an adviser to Assistant Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White. Mikesell was a member of the technical staff at the Bretton Woods conference, which resulted in the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In his *Bretton Woods Debates: A Memoir*, Mikesell notes that he provided White with data that supported the United States' free trade position and calculated the initial quotas for the World Bank and IMF. He was a close friend of White, Frank Coe, and Sol Adler, and believed that they were not Communist sympathizers.

Mikesell served the U.S. government in a number of capacities, including serving as representative of the United States Treasury Department in Cairo in 1943–44 and as the U.S. delegate to the Middle East Financial Conference in Cairo (April, 1944); as a member of the United States Currency Mission to Saudi Arabia (1948); as member of the staff of the National Commission on Materials Policy; and Chief of the Foreign Resources Division (1951). He also served as an economic adviser to the Joint British-American Cabinet Committee on Palestine.

He served as a consultant to the World Bank, the United Nations and the Organization of American States. He later argued for reform of the International Monetary Fund and abolishment of the World Bank, which he thought had become a useless and expensive bureaucracy. He was a member of the editorial board on the Middle East Journal from 1947.

Mikesell joined the University of Virginia department of Economics as professor in 1946 and accepted the W.E. Miner Chair at the University of Oregon in 1957, where he taught until 1993. He served as vice president for the Academy of International Business on the 1971–1972 board and was elected as an AIB Fellow in 1981. He was an avid tennis player and active outdoorsman, and he often took his doctoral students hiking before advising them on their dissertations as they sat around a campfire.

Mikesell died at his home in Eugene, Oregon, aged 93, from natural causes.
