## Active mines


### Puna Operations

The Puna Operations are in the Jujuy Province, Argentina. They include the Chinchillas and Pirquitas mines.
The Pirquitas mine is located in north-west Argentina. Reserves there are enough to keep it producing for 14.5 years at an average annual rate of 10 million ounces for silver and 2,500 tonnes for tin. In 2010, its first year of production, it produced 6.3 million ounces of silver, almost 70% of that in the second half. According to an analyst at Blackmont it will become "one of the world's primary silver mines".

The Chinchillas mine supplies ore to the Pirquitas processing facility.
