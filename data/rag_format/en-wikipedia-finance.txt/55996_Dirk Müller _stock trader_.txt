Born in Frankfurt, Müller grew up in Reilingen, Rhein-Neckar-Kreis, where he still lives. He passed the Abitur at the Carl-Friedrich-Gauß-Gymnasium in Hockenheim, and then began training as a bank teller and financial assistant at Deutsche Bank in Mannheim.

In 1993, Müller passed the Börsenhändlerprüfung exam. He then worked until 1997 as a broker for Finacor-Rabe & Partner, then for a year for Cantor Fitzgerald International, and from 1998 to 2008 as official stock trader at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange for ICF AG.

Müller published his first book, *Crashkurs*, in 2009, written in response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The successful publication made him well-known. His second book, *Cashkurs*, was published in 2011 and soon became a bestseller, number 1 on the list of *Der Spiegel*.

Müller was one of eight experts in a committee meeting of the German parliament Deutscher Bundestag on 27 June 2011, aiming at preventing speculation with agricultural raw materials ("Spekulation mit agrarischen Rohstoffen verhindern").
