# 123Net



**123.Net Inc.**, commonly known as **123NET**, is a telecommunications company based in Southfield, Michigan, USA. Founded in 1995, it provides a range of services including fiber internet, colocation, and business voice solutions.

The company operates a network spanning over 3,100 route miles of fiber, connecting major metropolitan areas across Michigan. 123NET manages the Detroit Internet Exchange (DET-iX), one of the largest fee-free internet exchanges in the world, and the Grand Rapids Internet Exchange (GRR-iX).

Even after having its controlling interest sold to Grain Management, 123NET continues to invest in expanding its high-density data centers and fiber infrastructure, with an emphasis on improving connectivity in underserved areas. The company is actively involved in public-private partnerships to support broadband expansion in Michigan.

In July 2024, a majority stake in the company was acquired by Grain Management, a private equity firm specializing in broadband infrastructure, although the original leadership retained a significant ownership share.
