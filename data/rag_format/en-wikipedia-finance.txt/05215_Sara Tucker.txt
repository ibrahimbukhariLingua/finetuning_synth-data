## Early life

A native of Laredo, Texas, Tucker received her undergraduate degree in journalism, graduating with honors, from the University of Texas at Austin (UT). She was a general-assignments reporter for the *San Antonio Express* before returning to UT, where she received a master of business administration degree with high honors.

Before joining HSF in 1997, Tucker spent 16 years at AT&T, the first Latina to reach the company's executive level. In her last assignment at the company, she was a regional vice president for AT&T's Global Business Communications Systems, where she led a $400 million division to its highest profit levels. Before this, she was vice president for consumer operations, a $370 million operation with 6,500 employees serving AT&T's 80 million consumers. Under her leadership, this group contributed to the division's receipt of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.


## Hispanic Scholarship Fund

Tucker worked for nine years as the CEO and president of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she aimed to double the rate of Hispanics earning college degrees.
