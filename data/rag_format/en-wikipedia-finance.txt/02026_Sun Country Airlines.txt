## History


### Early years and bankruptcies (1983–2008)

Sun Country was incorporated on 2 July 1982. It received its certificate of public necessity and convenience from the Civil Aeronautics Board on January 17, 1983. The company began offering charter service and the first revenue flight was on January 20, 1983 from Sioux Falls to Las Vegas, using a Boeing 727 aircraft leased from Air Florida. The airline's original staff consisted of sixteen pilots, sixteen flight attendants, three mechanics and one office person. A number of the original employees had previously worked for Braniff International Airways, which ceased operations on May 12, 1982. The company's founder and first President/CEO was Captain Jim Olsen, who also acted as Chief Pilot. His wife, Joan Smith-Olsen, acted as Chief Flight Attendant and Head of Inflight Operations.

In 1988, its headquarters were located on the grounds of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. In 1995, Sun Country began offering scheduled flights from Minneapolis to several major cities throughout the United States. In 2001, the company suspended operations due to financial troubles. In July 2006, the airline was acquired by Petters Group Worldwide and Whitebox Advisors.

Following the replacement of interim CEO Jay Salmen by Stan Gadek, former CFO of AirTran Airways, Sun Country was nearly finished by the major recession of 2008 and the revelation that Petters Group Worldwide was operating a massive financial fraud, a $3.25 billion Ponzi scheme. The airline furloughed 45 of its 156 pilots and scaled back its summer schedule due to rising fuel costs. Sun Country indicated it had hoped to get up to $50 million in loans or other financial help from the state of Minnesota and the airports commission. In September 2008 the carrier reduced, and in some cases eliminated, flights to San Francisco and Los Angeles. It also began charging for the first checked bag. At the end of September 2008, Gadek called for a 50% pay-deferral to all remaining employees. Tom Petters resigned after an FBI probe discovered that the airline had suffered financial fraud on a massive scale. Following this, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time, on October 6, 2008.


### Rebuilding and Davis brothers ownership (2011–2017)

In July 2011, Sun Country was bought out of bankruptcy for $34 million by the Davis family, owners of Cambria, a Minnesota-based countertop company. Marty Davis, CEO of Cambria, became chairman.

In 2015, the Sun Country board hired Zarir Erani as president and CEO. The airline had a net income of $27 million in 2015, followed by a 41% drop to $16 million in 2016.

In July 2017, after more than a year of missed monthly earnings projections, Davis replaced Erani as interim President and CEO, with Erani moving to other duties within the Davis family of companies. Jude Bricker, previously of Allegiant Air, was appointed as CEO one week after Erani stepped down. As part of its strategy, Sun Country had begun to move towards being a "no frills" airline.


### Apollo Global Management ownership (2017–present)

On December 14, 2017, the Davis brothers announced they would be selling the airline to funds affiliated with New York Based Apollo Global Management for an undisclosed amount.

On December 17, 2019, Amazon Air bought a minority stake in Sun Country from Apollo, with plans for the airline to operate cargo flights under the Amazon Air brand. As Sun Country's passenger model is heavily leisure focused, this deal is designed to help stabilize revenues during non-peak seasons. In December 2019 Sun Country announced they would begin operating cargo flights for Amazon. Sun Country will initially operate ten cargo jets for Amazon Air. The airline operated their first cargo flight for Amazon in May 2020.

On March 17, 2021, Sun Country became publicly listed and traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker SNCY.

As of June 2024, Sun Country's cargo fleet operated under contract with Amazon Air has grown to 12 airframes. On June 20, 2024, Sun Country and Amazon Air announced an extension to their contract out to 2030. Under this new contract, Amazon Air will transfer an additional 8 737-800BCF aircraft to Sun Country, increasing the airline's cargo fleet to 20 airframes.
