And has four technology focuses: hydronic flow control, integrated piping systems, advanced mechatronics and surface technologies.

In 2006, Aalberts was fined over €100 million by the European Commission for allegedly being part of a cartel for copper fittings. Aalberts appealed the decision and in 2011 the European Court of Justice acquitted Aalberts. However, the European Commission appealed that ruling. In July 2013, the Court finally acquitted Aalberts on appeal. The company has always denied involvement in the cartel and never made any provision for the fine.

## Critics

Aalberts has faced scrutiny due to its business operations in Russia, which accounted for less than 1% of its revenue in the region, while Eastern Europe contributed 11%. Following geopolitical tensions, the company stated its intention to continue operations in Russia at a "lower" level and postpone new investments. This decision reflects the company's response to the ongoing situation, aiming to manage risk while maintaining operations in the region.
