Mosely v Koffyfontein Mines Ltd


# Mosely v Koffyfontein Mines Ltd



The case of **Mosely v Koffyfontein Mines Ltd** [1904] 2 Ch 108 is a significant decision in UK company law, specifically concerning the issuance of debentures that are convertible into shares and the implications for their pricing relative to the nominal value of shares.


## Background

Koffyfontein Mines Ltd issued debentures that were convertible into shares of the company. The issue at hand was whether these debentures could be issued at a price below the nominal value of the company's shares.


## Legal Issue

The core legal issue in the case was whether debentures convertible into shares could be issued at a discount below the nominal value of the shares.


## Decision and Reasoning

The court held that debentures convertible into shares could not be issued at a price below the nominal value of the shares. This decision was based on the principle that the nominal value of shares represents a minimum value that shareholders are entitled to receive upon conversion of debentures into shares. Allowing debentures to be issued at a discount below this nominal value would effectively reduce the value of existing shareholders' holdings without their consent, which could unfairly prejudice their interests.

Lord Justice Vaughan Williams, delivering the judgment, emphasized the importance of protecting shareholders' rights and maintaining the integrity of share capital. He stated that if debentures are convertible into shares, they must be issued on terms that do not undermine the nominal value of existing shares. This principle ensures that shareholders are not disadvantaged by the issuance of convertible debentures and preserves the financial structure and integrity of the company's share capital.


## Impact and Significance

The decision in **Mosely v Koffyfontein Mines Ltd** established an important precedent in UK company law regarding the issuance of debentures convertible into shares. It clarified that such debentures cannot be issued at a price below the nominal value of the company's shares, thereby protecting the rights of existing shareholders and maintaining the nominal value of share capital.

This principle continues to be relevant in modern company law, ensuring that companies adhere to strict standards when structuring their financing arrangements and issuing convertible securities. It underscores the importance of transparency and fairness in corporate finance, particularly in dealings that could potentially dilute shareholders' equity interests.

In summary, **Mosely v Koffyfontein Mines Ltd** reaffirms the principle that debentures convertible into shares must respect the nominal value of shares, thereby safeguarding shareholders' interests and upholding the integrity of corporate capital structures.


## Facts

Debentures, convertible into shares, were issued at a price 20 per cent below the nominal share price. Shares were trading at 4 shillings. Although debentures can be issued at a ‘discount’, it was argued that their convertibility meant that this contravened the rule against shares being issued at a discount, now found in Companies Act 2006, section 580.


## Judgment

Held, that even though it was not an avoidance scheme, this was caught by the no issuing shares at a discount rule.
