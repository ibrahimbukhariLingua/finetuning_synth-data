# L-Bank



**L-Bank** (complete name *Landeskreditbank Baden-Württemberg – Förderbank –*) is the regional Förderbank for the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It was established in 1998 and is headquartered in Stuttgart.


## Overview

In 1988, *Landeskreditbank Baden-Württemberg* spun off its development finance operations as *Landeskreditbank Baden-Württemberg – Förderbank*, branded L-Bank, before merging the next year with Südwestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale [de] to form Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW). Also in 1998, the ownership of the Development Bank of Saxony was transferred from L-Bank to the state of Saxony.

In 2017, L-Bank lost a lawsuit in which it had argued that it should not have been brought under European Banking Supervision. Subsequent EU legislative changes, however, exempted all German *Förderbanken* from European-level supervision.

Together with other *Förderbanken* and the more commercially oriented Landesbanken, L-Bank is a member of the Association of German Public Banks (VÖB).
