Suncorp Group


# Suncorp Group



**Suncorp Group Limited**, known simply as **Suncorp**, is an Australian finance, insurance and banking corporation based in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was formed on 1 December 1996 by the merger of Suncorp, Metway Bank and the Queensland Industry Development Corporation (QIDC), and is one of Australia's mid-sized banks (by combined lending and deposits) and its largest general insurance group.


## History


### State Government Insurance Office

Queensland established the State Accident Insurance Office in 1916, to provide mandatory injury compensation insurance to workers in the state's business sector. New legislation soon after created a larger insurance body, the State Government Insurance Office (SGIO) which took over the State Accident Insurance Office. General insurance, third party and life products were added. SGIO later expanded into building society operations, superannuation, and finance.

In 1960, new legislation established the SGIO as a separate corporation, and the group became subject to state regulatory oversight. In 1971, the SGIO took another step toward full-fledged corporate status, forming its own board of directors. At that time, the operations involving injury compensation for workers were placed under a separate board. By 1976, as SGIO's insurance operations took on a more commercial orientation, and the company closed down its building society operations.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The next move toward the SGIO's privatisation came in 1985. Under new legislation, the company dropped the SGIO name and became Suncorp, and its employees lost their status as civil servants. At the same time, Suncorp became an independent corporation, although still government controlled. By the mid 1990s, Suncorp was an allfinanz (i.e. with combined banking, financial, and insurance operations) group and had assets of nearly $10 billion.


### Metway Bank

Metway Bank started as the Metropolitan Permanent Building Society in 1959. In the late 1980s, Metropolitan joined the trend among Australia's building societies to expand into becoming full-scale banks. In 1988, Metropolitan abandoned its status as a building society to reincorporate as a bank. Metway, as the new bank was called, listed publicly and began acquiring a number of rival banks and building societies. By the mid 1990s, Metway had become the largest Queensland-based bank. Its operations extended into the other eastern Australian states and the assets of the bank were more than $7 billion.


### Queensland Industry Development Corporation

QIDC had its origins in Agbank, which was a state government farming financier inaugurated in 1902. In 1986, new Queensland legislation incorporated and regulated the bank as the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. By the mid 1990s, QIDC had assets of approximately $3 billion.


### Merger as Suncorp-Metway: 1996 to 1999

In response to sweeping changes in Australia's financial and insurance industries in the mid-1990s, and especially the increasing convergence of the banking and insurance sectors, the state owned QIDC and Suncorp were amalgamated with Metway Bank in 1996. The new company, Suncorp-Metway, became one of the largest insurance and finance groups in Australia, ranking fifth in the national market. By 1998, the company's combined assets exceeded $22 billion.

The Queensland government initially controlled 68 percent of the new company, but quickly made good on its promise to sell most of its stake. In 1997, the company conducted a public offering that reduced the government's stake in Suncorp-Metway to 4 percent, with the last remaining government shares sold a year later. In 1999, Suncorp-Metway completed the integration of the Metway, QIDC and Suncorp operations, and launched a single unified Suncorp-Metway brand. As part of that process, the company also trimmed its retail network, shutting down a number of redundant branches.


### Further conglomeration: 2000 to 2006

After its integration phase, Suncorp-Metway adopted a new strategy. It decided to launch itself on a truly national scale, replacing its allfinanz model with a new financial conglomerate strategy. The company wanted to expand, particularly in its more profitable insurance division. It made its first acquisition in 2001 by taking over GIO General Ltd, which was then part of AMP. That purchase made Suncorp-Metway the second-ranked in Australia in terms of income from general insurance in annual premiums.

The company carried out another rebranding exercise in 2002, adopting the Suncorp name for all of its Queensland operations, and for non-insurance operations outside of the state. The company's insurance operations, excluding Queensland, took on the GIO name.

Suncorp continued to build up its insurance portfolio into the middle of the decade. It acquired 50 percent of the Queensland-based RACQ Insurance, a joint venture originally formed between AMP and RACQ. Suncorp bought out AMP's share of the joint venture in 2002. Also in 2002, Suncorp purchased half of RAA Insurance from the RAA. In 2004, the company purchased Tasmania's RACT Insurance from the RACT.


### Promina acquisition: 2007

Suncorp then began preparations for a still larger takeover of insurance giant Promina Group Limited. By early 2007, the two companies had agreed the terms of a merger deal valued at AUD 7.9 billion ($5.9 billion), which represented one of the largest acquisition deals completed in Australia's financial sector since the beginning of the new century.

Promina was formerly part of the UK-based insurance giant Royal and Sun Alliance until it spun off the business in Australia as a separate public company in 2003. The merger transformed Suncorp into a true giant in Australia, doubling its assets to nearly AUD 85 billion ($65 billion).


## Recent events

During a retail banking review in 2007, Suncorp determined that its credit card portfolio was a non-core asset and entered into talks to sell its 100,000 card/$230 million credit-card portfolio to Citibank. Citibank now handles the operational aspects of credit whilst the Suncorp brand remains on the cards and Suncorp continues to provide customer interaction.

As of 2007, Suncorp had assets of over A$95 billion, over 9 million customers, and over 16,000 staff. Suncorp operated 232 retail and business banking outlets, predominantly in Queensland. GIO operated 34 agencies in NSW and Victoria. An additional 157 retail branches and services centres were added with the Promina acquisition.

In June 2013, Goldman Sachs's Special Situations Group, the proprietary investment unit of the investment bank, purchased some of Suncorp Group Ltd.'s loans for about US$863 million. In the summer of 2013 as European lenders were divesting their loans portfolios, in Australia, hedge funds and investment banks were buying them. In 2013, distressed-debt investors, seeking investment opportunities in Asia, particularly in Australia, acquired discounted bonds or bank loans of companies facing distressed debt, with the potential of profitable returns if the companies' performance or their debt-linked assets improves. In 2013 Australia was one of the biggest markets for distressed-debt investors in Asia.

Suncorp Business Services appointed its new CEO, Matt Pancino, on 13 June 2014. Pancino formerly worked as the Chief Information Officer for the group. Suncorp was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2016.

In 2020, Suncorp admitted to wage theft dating back to 2014. In June 2023, it was announced that remediation of the theft amounted a total $32 million in wages, misappropriated from 15,800 staff.

Suncorp has been granted a MySuper authority, enabling it to continue to receive default superannuation contribution from 1 January 2014.

### Suncorp Bank

On 19 April 2009, Suncorp announced a re-branding of the banking arm of the company to Suncorp Bank, to emphasise that Suncorp was a bank with an insurance arm, not an insurance company with a banking division.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In July 2022, Suncorp Group agreed terms to sell Suncorp Bank to the Australia & New Zealand Banking Group for A$5 billion. However, in August 2023, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission blocked the deal. The Australian Competition Tribunal overturned the decision, and Suncorp sold its banking business to ANZ for 4.1 billion dollars on 31 July 2024.


### Joint ventures

Suncorp acquired insurance joint ventures with motoring clubs RACQ and RAA in 2001, but chose to divest them in 2010. Suncorp entered into a joint venture agreement with RACT Insurance in Tasmania in 2007, but sold its 50% interest back to RACT in July 2021.
