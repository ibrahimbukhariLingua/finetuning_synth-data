## History

Orbis Technology Ltd was founded on 2 February 1996 by Clive Haworth, James Caddy and Charles Malir.

The company's first sports betting application was released as Betonline through a City Index and Sporting Life joint venture in time for the 1998 World Cup. In 1999 Orbis launched their OpenBet Casino at ICE and the Sky Vegas Live Roulette channel was launched. By 2000, Ladbrokes, Surrey Sports and Paddy Power were live on OpenBet.

In December 2000, the company was acquired by NDS Group, a News Corporation company and a technology provider in digital television. James Caddy stepped down as CEO in 2004 with David Loveday taking over. NT Media was acquired in September 2005 and then Electracade in December 2008.

In 2010, Orbis Technology was renamed to OpenBet, the name of its eponymous software betting platform. It also acquired Alphameric Solutions, a software company supplying betting retail products, which was renamed as the OpenBet Retail division.

It was in a *Sunday Times* survey in 2010, and achieved a one star accreditation in 2015.

In January 2011, OpenBet was sold by NDS for £208 million, in a management buyout backed by private equity firm, Vitruvian Partners. In March 2013 David Loveday stepped down, with COO Jeremy Thompson-Hill taking over as CEO of Openbet.

In April 2015, OpenBet acquired their Greek branch from outsourcing partner Athens Technology Center S.A., increasing the group's headcount by 25%.

In 2016, OpenBet was named sports betting supplier of the year at the eGamingReview B2B awards for the seventh successive year. Vitruvian Partners sold OpenBet to NYX Gaming Group in 2016.

In 2017, NYX was acquired by Scientific Games Corporation with OpenBet becoming part of the latter's SG Digital division in 2018.

In 2019, OpenBet partnered up with the TAB NZ, a New Zealand betting site.

In September 2021, Endeavor Group announced that it would acquire OpenBet for $1.2 billion in cash and stock. The acquisition was completed in September 2022.

In June 2023, OpenBet acquired Neccton, which is a responsible gaming and fraud detection app provider.

In August 2024, Endeavor announced that OpenBet and IMG Arena would be put up for sale as part of its plans to go private. On November 11, 2024, it was announced that OpenBet would be sold in a management buyout to a group led by Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel for $450 million.
