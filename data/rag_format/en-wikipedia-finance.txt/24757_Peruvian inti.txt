Peruvian inti


# Peruvian inti



The **inti** was the currency of Peru between 1985 and 1991. Its ISO 4217 code was *PEI* and its abbreviation was *I/.* The inti was divided into 100 céntimos. The inti replaced the inflation-stricken sol. The new currency was named after Inti, the Inca sun god.


## History

The inti was introduced on 1 February 1985, replacing the sol de oro which had suffered from high inflation. One inti was equivalent to 1,000 soles de oro. Coins denominated in the new unit were put into circulation from May 1985 and banknotes followed in June of that year.

By 1990, the inti had itself suffered from high inflation. As an interim measure, from January to July 1991, the "inti millón" (I/m.) was used as a unit of account. One inti millón was equal to 1,000,000 intis and hence to one new sol. The *nuevo sol* ("new sol") was adopted on 1 July 1991, replacing the inti at an exchange rate of a million to one. Thus: 1 new sol = 1,000,000 intis = 1,000,000,000 soles de oro.

Inti notes and coins are no longer legal tender in Peru, nor can they be exchanged for notes and coins denominated in the current *nuevo sol*.


### Inti million(I./.m.)

The Inti million was a currency unit adopted on 1st January 1991, by the Supreme Decree n.º 326-90-EF accepted on 16th December 1990. This unit was in force until 1 July 1991. Both prices and accounting records were expressed in millions of Intis with all the zeros removed.

For example: I/. 12,453,734 = I/.m. 12,45


## Coins

Coins were introduced in 1985 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 centimos (designs were taken from the previous 10, 50, 100, and 500 *soles de oro* coins), plus 1 and 5 intis. The 1 céntimo coin was issued only in 1985. The 5 céntimo coins were issued until 1986. All the other denominations were issued until 1988. All coins featured Navy Admiral Miguel Grau: cent coins on the reverse, Inti coins on the obverse.


## Banknotes

In June 1985, notes were introduced in denominations of I/.10, I/.50 (taken from previous 10,000 and 50,000 *soles de oro* notes) and I/.100, followed by I/.500 in December of the same year. The next year, I/.1,000 notes were added, followed by I/.5,000 and I/.10,000 in 1988. 50,000 and I/.100,000 notes were added in 1989. I/.500,000 denominations were added early in 1990, I/.1,000,000 denominations were added in mid-1990, and I/.5,000,000 intis in August 1990. The obverses featured:

The name of the printers are seen on the backside of the note on the left side or right side of the down corner of the banknote.
