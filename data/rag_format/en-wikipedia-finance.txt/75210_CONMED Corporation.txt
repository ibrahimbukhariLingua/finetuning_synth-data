## History

In 1970, Eugene Corasanti (1930–2015) purchased a small medical supplied distributor in Utica, New York. He originally named the company Concor Enterprises, but later renamed it to Consolidated Medical Equipment, Inc. Its first product was a disposable ECG electrode. Corasanti served as CEO until 2006 and chairman of the board until 2014. By the time he retired, CONMED had grown to around $700 million of sales.

In May 2003 CONMED was cited by the FDA for violations at its Colorado plant. Later in 2003, it filed suit against Johnson & Johnson, alleging that Johnson & Johnson was illegally coercing hospitals into purchasing their surgical instruments. A financial analyst for Zacks in 2006 criticized CONMED for taking on the financial strain of this suit, combined with poor growth and debt from recent acquisitions.

Eugene's son Joseph J. Corasanti replaced him as CEO in late 2006, which was criticized by some as nepotism. At the time, the board had consisted entirely of Utica-area residents. Joseph stepped down in 2014.

In July 2022, CONMED moved its headquarters from Utica to Largo, Florida. Its plant in Utica remains open.
