## History

In 1986, the Hiranandani group signed a tripartite agreement between the group, the state of Maharashtra, and the MMRDA for developing 93 hectares (230 acres) of land and for constructing affordable housing. The contract was signed at the rate of ₹0.40 (equivalent to ₹5.00 or 5.9¢ US in 2023) per acre or ₹0.99 (equivalent to ₹13 or 15.2¢ US in 2023) per hectare. As per the contract, the real estate developer was to construct apartments measuring 430 sq ft (40 m²) and 861 sq ft (80 m²) (50% each) as "Medium Income Group Homes" (affordable housing).

Construction started in 1989, when the area was barren and hilly. The area lacked basic infrastructure such as roads, sanitary sewer lines, water or electrical connections. Along with developing the basic infrastructure, more than 100,000 trees were also planted. By the early 1990s the first phase of apartments were ready and were initially sold at the rate of ₹5,400 (equivalent to ₹53,000 or US$619.70 in 2023) per square metre or ₹500 (equivalent to ₹4,900 or US$57.40 in 2023) per square foot. In the late 1990s, the construction and the architecture strategy was changed from "affordable" to upmarket housing, and the neoclassical architecture was adapted as the theme for upcoming buildings. By the mid-1990s, a shopping mall (Galleria) was constructed at the geographical centre of the township.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
