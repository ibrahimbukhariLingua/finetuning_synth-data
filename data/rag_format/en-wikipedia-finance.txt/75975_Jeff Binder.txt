## Career

In the 1990s, Binder's father created a company, Magic Music, which used digital storage in the mass-production of cassette tapes. Jeff credits his father and grandfather for infusing his early years with "out-of-the-box" ideas that are key to his success in entrepreneurship today.

Prior to his work in the media and telecommunications sectors, Binder was CEO of Leading Golf Courses of America, a nationwide golf membership program that included some of the top golf courses in America. Jack Nicklaus became a partner.

In 1999, Binder and Robert Scheffler started Broadbus Technologies, which used digital storage, but was created instead for video-on-demand entertainment experiences. The company was sold to Motorola in 2006 for an estimated $186 million.

In 2008, Binder joined Dave Fellows, former CTO of Comcast and AT&T Broadband, along with Broadbus executive Vin Bisceglia, to launch Genovation Capital, an early stage venture firm focused on the media space.

Binder invested in This Technology a video-on-demand advertising company, and joined as its Chairman, in 2012.
