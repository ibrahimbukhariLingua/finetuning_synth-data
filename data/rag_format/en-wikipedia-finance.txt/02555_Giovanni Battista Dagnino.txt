## Career

Since 2001, Dagnino has researched coopetition strategy, and, with Richard D'Aveni and Ken Smith, in 2010 has inaugurated the study of temporary competitive advantage as a consequence of hypercompetition. In addition, Dagnino is researching hubris-driven strategies and the relationships between strategy, entrepreneurship and governance. In this field, he received the "Best Paper Proceedings" Award by the Academy of Management for a study on corporate governance and international diversification.

Dagnino's research contributions revolve around the advancement of the strategic theory of the firm with specific focus on coopetition strategy dynamics, the relationships between strategy, entrepreneurship and governance, and the management of temporary advantages.

More recently, he has been carrying out various research projects and graduate teaching on digital transformation strategies, digital mindset, big data analytics, and AI strategy.

## Impact

**Academic**

Professor Dagnino's work and streams of seminal publications have been instrumental in establishing and landing two entirely new fields of study and practice in the management realm:

(1) coopetition strategy, a field of study/practice he contributed to set off over a decade ago; and

(2) the kickoff and extension of temporary advantage.

*Wiley Publishing* – Two consecutive times **Wiley Top Cited Article 2020-2021 and 2021-2022** and **Wiley Top Downloaded Article 2019-2020** for "Temporary Competitive Advantage: An Investigation into the Core of the Literature and Challenges for Future Research” - Dagnino, G.B., Picone, P.M., and Ferrigno, G. (2021). *International Journal of Management Reviews*. 23(1): 85-115.

**Practice**

**Coopetition Strategy**

*Teaching*. As a fallout of the stream of publications and the various initiative and activities conducted over time on the relevant issue and its ensuing international recognition, coopetition and coopetition strategy receive specific treatment in a range of standard undergraduate and graduate textbooks in strategic management, such as F.T. Rothaermel, *Strategic Management*. McGraw-Hill (3rd edn. 2016), and R.M. Grant, *Contemporary Strategy Analysis*. Wiley (11th edn. 2021).

*Dictionaries*. The term coopetition is shown today in many major English dictionaries such as Cambridge and Collins.

**Temporary Advantage**

*Consulting*. BCG Henderson Institute Podcast on Temporary and Sustainable Nature of Competitive Advantage (28/09/2022): https://bcghendersoninstitute.com/rita-mcgrath-and-roger-l-martin-on-the-nature-of-competitive-advantage/

*Military*. His pioneering publication on temporary competitive advantage in Strategic Management Journal (2010), has been cited and used since July 2020 by the US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM), US Army War College and the Strategic Studies Institute (SSI), in their report An Army Transformed: USINDOPACOM Hypercompetition and US Army Theater Design. The USINDOPACOM is responsible for integrated military actions in India, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, China, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii.

Contrary to the customary flows of knowledge that has traditionally arrowed from to military strategy to strategic management, this condition shapes an extraordinary reverse effect from strategic management to military strategy.
