The following events occurred in **August 1981**:


## August 1, 1981 (Saturday)

* MTV, the Music Television cable network, went on the air at 12:01 AM from Fort Lee, New Jersey on cable systems in the United States, with John Lack's introductory words, "Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll." Initially, MTV showed music videos 24 hours a day. The very first selection was "Video Killed the Radio Star" from Buggles. Pat Benatar's "You Better Run" was the second. When it launched, MTV reached 800,000 subscribers and cable television was still in only 25% of American homes. The MTV network would come under criticism in its first 19 months of existence because of its practice of featuring only songs from white musical artists in heavy rotation.
* Abu Daoud, the PLO terrorist who had overseen the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics, was shot five times at close range while sitting in the coffee shop of the Victoria Hotel in Warsaw. Daoud survived his wounds and lived almost 30 more years until his death at the age of 72.
* Canadian serial killer Clifford Robert Olson, Jr., who abducted and murdered 11 teenagers and children (mostly girls) over eight months in British Columbia, was stopped by police after he picked up two young girls who were hitchhiking. He was arrested after the name and address of one of his victims was found in a book in his van. After the government guaranteed to provide $110,000 ($343,885 as of 2023) to his wife, Olson showed police the location of the bodies of victims who had not yet been located and pled guilty to 11 counts of murder on January 11, 1982. He died in prison in 2011.
* In Mexico, a freight train derailment near San Luis Potosi ruptured a tanker car carrying chlorine gas, killing 29 people and sending another 1,000 to the hospital.

* Frederick Mellinger, owner of Frederick's of Hollywood, introduced thong underwear to the United States.
* The Hong Kong freighter MV *Primrose*, with a crew of 31, ran aground on a coral reef during a storm near North Sentinel Island in the Andaman Islands and soon had to radio for help when it came under attack by "spear-waving wild natives". Captain Liu Chung-long sent an SOS on August 10 with a cable saying "Wild island people carrying spears and arrows attempted to board the ship. All crew members' lives not guaranteed. Request assistance and protection urgently, otherwise please arrange air drop weapons for defense." A Singapore tugboat and an Indian Navy landing craft arrived on August 11 to protect MV *Primrose*. A follow-up message estimated that more than 50 natives were "carrying various home-made weapons and are making two or three wooden boats" and added "Worrying that they will board us at sunset." Rough seas and monsoon winds prevented any possibility of an actual attack before the rescue ship arrived, and a spokesman for the Indian Navy said after the crew had been airlifted by helicopter that there was never any danger and that "It is perfectly normal for the Sentinelese to walk around with bows and arrows. It is part of their dress. At no time was the crew harmed and no time did the Sentinelese try to board the ship." After the crewmen were taken to Port Blair by helicopter, arrangements wer made for them to be flown to Kolkata. Decades later, the story would be embellished on the internet as a "strange mystery".

The union's demand was for each employee to have a $10,000 annual wage increase, a 32-hour workweek (a four-day week and an eight-hour day combined) and increased benefits. President Reagan, citing the law that prohibited federal government employees from striking, ordered walkouts to return before 11:00 am EST Wednesday or be fired. Of the 16,395 Americans who guided airplane takeoffs and landings, 4,199 stayed on the job. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) responded by using a central control station to send clearances to the nation's airports, which operated at 50% capacity.
