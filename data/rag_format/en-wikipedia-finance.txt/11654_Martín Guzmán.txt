## Early life and education

Martín Maximiliano Guzmán was born on 12 October 1982 in La Plata, Buenos Aires Province.

In 2013 he earned a doctorate on Economics from Brown University. His theoretical influences include Carlos Daniel Heymann and Joseph Stiglitz.

On 27 November 2021, Pope Francis named Guzmán a numbered member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.


## Minister of Economy

His first legislative initiative, the Social Solidarity and Productive Recovery Bill, was passed by Congress on 23 December.

The bill included tax hikes on foreign currency purchases, agricultural exports, wealth, and car sales - as well as tax incentives for production. Amid the worst recession in nearly two decades, it provided a 180-day freeze on utility rates, bonuses for the nation's retirees and Universal Allocation per Child beneficiaries, and food cards to two million of Argentina's poorest families.

It also gave the president additional powers to renegotiate debt terms – with Argentina seeking to restructure its US$100 billion debt with private bondholders and US$45 billion borrowed by Mauricio Macri administration from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF reported that the COVID-19 crisis would plunge Argentina's GDP by 9.9%. Unemployment jumped from 8.9% in late 2019 to 13.1% in the second quarter of 2020 (the highest since 2004), at the height of the Covid-related lockdown - but eased steadily afterwards, to 7% by late 2021.

On 4 August 2020, Guzmán reached an accord with the biggest creditors on terms for a restructuring of $65 billion in foreign bonds, after a breakthrough in talks that had at times looked close to collapse since the country's ninth debt default in May. The country's public foreign debt, which had nearly doubled during the Macri administration, slimmed from $197 billion in late 2019 to $191 billion in late 2021.

Under Guzmán, Argentina also refinanced a record, $45 billion IMF bailout debt inherited from the Macri administration - and saw 10.4% growth in 2021 and 5.7% in January–April 2022, after three years of deep recession. Inflation, however, remained stubbornly high - initially slowing from 54% in 2019 to 36% in 2020; but rising to over 60% by May 2022.

On 2 July 2022, following depreciation of the peso and shortages of diesel fuel, and amid pressure from the left wing of the governing coalition, Guzmán resigned as Minister of Economy.
