Fishman joined WaMu on September 8, 2008, replacing outgoing CEO Kerry Killinger as part of that bank's restructuring in the face of the subprime mortgage crisis.

According to C-Span on September 26, he was ultimately paid $19 million for three weeks of work at WaMu, including severance pay. Meanwhile, the company's stock price dwindled to pennies after trading as high as $45 a share in 2007. The previous CEO was paid $14 million for one year on the job.
