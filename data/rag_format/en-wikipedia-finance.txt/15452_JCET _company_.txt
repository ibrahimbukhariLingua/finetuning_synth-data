## History

JCET (Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology) was founded in 1972, when the Jiangyin converted a factory into a facility for manufacturing transistors. The company's first automated manufacturing processes came online in 1986. JCET went public on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in June 2003. Later that year, it introduced several new products and subsidiaries, including the subsidiary JiangYin Changdian Advanced Packaging Co., Ltd. (JCAP) (later renamed as JCET Advanced Packaging Co.). JCAP works with Chinese universities on research and development in the semiconductor industry and became the largest wafer-level packaging company in China.

By 2004, JCET was manufacturing 2.5 billion integrated circuits and 15 billion transistor components annually. It opened a new research and development center in Singapore in 2007 and a new manufacturing facility in Jiangyin in 2008. From 2009 to 2013, JCET's revenues grew 17.8% per-year. The company had US$611 million in annual revenue by 2011, which grew to $711 million by 2012. By 2015, JCET had five production centers in China and more than one billion USD in annual revenues.

In the 2000s, JCET's revenues decreased from more semiconductor companies bringing their packaging in-house, but later grew due to the increased demand for electronics.

JCET completed the acquisition of Singapore-based competitor STATS ChipPAC for $1.8 billion in August 2015. STATS ChipPAC was a competitor of JCET and the fourth-largest semiconductor packaging and testing company. The following year, JCET invested $300 million to double STATS ChipPAC's manufacturing capacity.

In March 2024, China Resources Microelectronics acquired a 22.5% stake in JCET making it the controlling shareholder.
