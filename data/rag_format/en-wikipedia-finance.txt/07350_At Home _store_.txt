## History

At Home was founded in 1979 in Schertz, Texas, as **Garden Ridge Pottery** and was later renamed to **Garden Ridge**.

Investment firm Three Cities Research became the largest shareholder of Garden Ridge in 1999.

Garden Ridge filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2004. After the reorganization, the corporation emerged from Chapter 11 in 2005.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

AEA Investors acquired Garden Ridge in October 2011. CEO Lee Bird III joined Garden Ridge in December 2012. Prior to this, Bird was President of Nike Affiliates for Nike Inc., Chief Operating Officer of Gap, and Chief Financial Officer of Old Navy.

In 2014, Garden Ridge converted all stores to the At Home brand and floorplan. The rebranding project changed the use of orange color for advertising to a soft grey and blue, and added a house symbol for the "o" in At Home. The rebranding cost around $20 million.

At Home publicly filed an S-1 on September 4, 2015, to go public.

In July 2021, At Home was acquired by Hellman & Friedman.

In October 2023, Fitch Ratings reported that At Home was nearing a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
