# Marc Feigen



**Marc A. Feigen** is an American business executive. As the CEO of Feigen Advisors, he primarily advises CEOs in the Fortune 200, while training and educating new CEOs for the chief executive role. Considered "America's leading coach for CEOs," Feigen has guided more than 35 chief executives of global companies, including Disney, Ford, and Netflix. He is an expert on CEO succession and investor relations.

Feigen Advisors publishes the annual “New CEO Report,” which profiles new S&P 250 CEOs and has been cited in *Fortune*, *HuffPost*, and other news outlets. The chairman of the firm's Advisory Board is Richard Parsons, the former chairman of Citigroup and the former chairman and CEO of Time Warner.

A *Harvard Business Review* contributor, Feigen is quoted in *The Wall Street Journal* as an expert on corporate management. Feigen advocates for companies to groom and choose more female CEOs, and for companies to consider co-CEOs. His research, published in *Harvard Business Review*, showed that co-CEOs delivered nearly 40 percent higher shareholder returns than the industry average across 87 public companies. In March 2024, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that then-Netflix CEO (and current executive chairman) Reed Hastings enlisted Feigen for succession planning help. According to *Australian Financial Review*, Feigen spent months with co-CEO Greg Peters (who was COO at the time) training him to co-lead Netflix.

Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the *Freakonomics* book series, has called Feigen "an evangelist for co-CEOs." In September 2023, Feigen appeared on *Freakonomics Radio* as an expert on the conditions that help predict whether co-CEOs and other business leaders will succeed.

In 2017, *Fortune* profiled Feigen's work as a CEO advisor, calling him "the CEO whisperer" and sharing five of his management lessons. The story praises Feigen for "lift[ing] the role of C-suite counselor to an entirely new dimension." That same year, Feigen appeared on Wharton Business Radio to discuss the 2016 New CEO Report. He also published an op-ed column in *Investor's Business Daily* explaining the report's key findings.

Feigen is the Executive Vice Chairman and co-founder of Cambridge in America. He is also an Honorary Fellow at St John’s College (University of Cambridge) and co-chair of Every Vote Counts' executive board. Feigen teaches a course on the CEO's role at the Cambridge Judge Business School.
