According to DealStreetAsia citing sources, Antonio sought to raise from several venture capitalists in order to bolster its "unicorn" valuation. In an email exchange seen by DealStreetAsia, Antonio tried to raise $1-3 million at a $1.85 billion valuation in 2017.

Antonio is an art collector. In 2013, his 25,000 square foot Manila home was completed. The house, which Antonio named "Stealth", was designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and includes a dedicated private gallery of portraits he has commissioned of himself by famous artists.

A profile by *Vanity Fair* commented on the extreme disparity between Antonio's wealth and the average income of the Philippines. In a 2013 op-ed in the *Manila Times*, the article claimed that the Antonio family was on the *Forbes* list of top 40 wealthiest Filipinos and that they were not listed in the top 500 taxpayers of BIR's. The author characterized Antonio's personal spending on vanity projects and relatively modest philanthropic spending as indicative of inequality in the Philippines where the average family income in 2013 was $4,988.

BIR records show that the Antonios were among the top 500 taxpayers in the Philippines in 2012 and 2013.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
