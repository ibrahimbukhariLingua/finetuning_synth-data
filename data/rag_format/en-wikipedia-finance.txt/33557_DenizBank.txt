DenizBank


# DenizBank



**DenizBank A.Ş.** is a large private bank in Turkey. It is currently owned by Emirates NBD. It was owned and controlled by leading Russian bank Sberbank from 2012 to 2019. European financial services institution Dexia was the owner before this.


## History

Operations commenced in a hotel room in August that year, and the bank moved into its new headquarters in Karaköy the following month. Its first 13 branches (5 outside Istanbul) were also opened. With a revitalization program initiated, branches were opened under a new corporate identity. Expansion was supported by the acquisition of branch offices from other banks, including Tarişbank in 2002. Internet banking was introduced in 1999, and Deniz Yatırım was founded in 2001.

2002 saw the bank move into its new headquarters in Esentepe, Şişli, and the acquisition of Tarişbank. The bank's IPO on the Istanbul stock exchange took place in 2004.

On May 31, 2006, Dexia announced it had acquired a 75% stake in the company for US$2.437 billion. The remaining 25% of the shares were held publicly. It remained the primary shareholder until 2012, when Sberbank agreed to buy DenizBank for US$3.6 billion from the financially troubled Dexia.

Emirates NBD agreed to buy DenizBank from Sberbank in 2018. The deal was completed in July 2019.

As of July 2019, the only shareholder of the bank is Emirates NBD (99.85% of shares).

## Controversies

In November 2024, there were some developments regarding allegations of fraud involving high-profile football stars. Prosecutors in Istanbul have prepared an indictment seeking prison sentences ranging from 72 to 240 years for Denizbank's CEO, **Hakan Ates**, and former assistant general manager, **Mehmet Aydogdu**. They are accused of orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that defrauded players such as Arda Turan and Fernando Muslera, among others, out of approximately $44 million through a purported "secret special fund".

The case stems from actions taken by a former branch manager, **Secil Erzan**, who has been accused of running a Ponzi scheme. The indictment claims that Ates and Aydogdu were aware of Erzan's activities, given their close relationships with some of the complainants.

Both Ates and Aydogdu have vehemently denied the allegations. Ates stated he only learned of the fraudulent activities in April 2023 and promptly reported it to authorities, asserting that any fund creation would require regulatory approval. Aydogdu echoed this sentiment, claiming he had no knowledge of the fraud and attributing his involvement to his connections with Galatasaray, the football club linked to many victims.

Denizbank has publicly distanced itself from the allegations, stating that it has not received any formal information regarding the investigation and criticizing the premature disclosure of indictment details as a violation of confidentiality. As the case unfolds, no arrests have yet been made, nor have any court appearances been scheduled for Ates or Aydogdu.
