## Early life

Melvin was an early fan of Dungeons & Dragons. At 15 years old, Melvin met Gary Gygax at a fan convention, where the two discussed an idea for automating the role of the Dungeon Master. At the urging of Gygax, Melvin created GameAssist using Z80 assembly on TRS-80 computers. GameAssist was a tool to assist Dungeon Masters in the Dungeons & Dragons game with tracking player statistics and inventory and in managing and generating creature encounters. Melvin sold the Intellectual property behind GameAssist in 1980 to a gaming supplies store after he left to attend college at Tulane University.


## Introduction to the foodservice industry

Melvin's career of creating technology solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for the foodservice industry began when he was 18 years old, when he was hired by a Wendy's franchisee to develop software for the franchisee's Wendy's stores. This software was later adopted by Wendy's corporate.

In 1986, Melvin co-founded Techwerks. Techwerks became one of the largest global resellers of NCR retail hardware. While at Techwerks, Melvin developed touchscreen point of sale software called "Foodwerks" for fast food restaurants.

Foodwerks was sold in April 1989 for almost $2 million to an investor group led by Melvin.


## Compris Technologies

With support from Dave Thomas, and financial backing from IBM, Melvin founded Compris Technologies in late 1989. The primary product offered by Compris Technologies was a point of sale (POS) software application. IBM, in a partnership with Compris Technologies, created the first commercial IBM touchscreen POS units, IBM kiosk POS units and IBM handheld POS units. As a result, the Compris POS software application was first mainly installed on IBM 46xx Series hardware, but later supported by several other POS hardware manufacturers including NCR. Between 1989 and 1992, Compris quickly grew to become the dominant global provider of foodservice technology. The Compris POS software continued to increase in popularity throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, winning several Microsoft Retail Application Developer (RAD) Awards.

Other technology companies, such as Par Technology Corporation, partnered with Apigent Solutions to provide comprehensive technology offeringsᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ to foodservice chains within the quick service (QSR) segment. At the time, Apigent Solutions was the only Sun Microsystems SunTone Certified data center in the foodservice industry.

In 2002, Apigent Solutions was sold to eMac Digital, a joint venture backed by McDonald's and KKR.


## SIVA Corporation

On January 1, 2003, Melvin acquired SIVA Corporation, a provider of cloud-based POS software, from a private investor group. Melvin shut down the business for a year following the acquisition to rearchitect the underlying technology as an enterprise-focused system. Upon completion of the reengineering effort, Darden Restaurants became iSIVA's first customer in 2003.
