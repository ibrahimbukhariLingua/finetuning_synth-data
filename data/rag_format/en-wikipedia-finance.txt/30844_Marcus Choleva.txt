His great-grandparents fled Eastern Europe due to rekindled anti-Semitism. His family was arrested by the Gestapo during World War II and subsequently sent to the concentration camp Theresienstadt in present-day Czech Republic. The Danish Jews in Theresienstadt were treated better than other European Jews in the concentration camp, and were not immediately deported to death camps like many of the other European Jews in the camp. Marcus Choleva and most of his family spent a year and a half in the concentration camp, surviving the Holocaust. Back in Denmark after the war, Choleva completed a master's degree in economics at University of Copenhagen.
