## History

Atlas traces its roots to 1948, when a group of 33 entrepreneurs formed a cooperative for interstate transportation of household goods. The group took the name "Atlas Van Lines" and opened a new headquarters building in Evansville, Indiana. The company changed ownership structure in the 1980s when it offered stock to the public. After a hostile takeover attempt, the company returned to ownership by its agents in 1988. Atlas expanded rapidly in the 1990s and established Atlas World Group as the holding company for Atlas Van Lines, Inc., and seven subsidiaries.

In 1996 Atlas purchased Red Ball Corporation, the 13th largest household mover in the United States at the time, including its two subsidiaries: American Red Ball International, an international freight forwarder based in Seattle, Washington, and American Red Ball Transit Co. based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Red Ball specialized in the moves of US military personnel. In 2001, Atlas sold American Red Ball Transit, the domestic subsidiary, to its management.

In 1997 the company added Atlantic Relocation Systems (more than 600 vehicles) and Bekins Northwest (more than 250). In 2000, Atlas purchased a controlling interest in Cornerstone Relocation Group, a full service global relocation management company based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, expanding global relocation services to corporate transportation clients.

In 2020, Atlas won a three-year contract from the United States Transportation Command valued at nearly $7.2 billion for all global relocation services for the United States Department of Defense and the United States Coast Guard service members, their families, and Department of Defense civilians.
