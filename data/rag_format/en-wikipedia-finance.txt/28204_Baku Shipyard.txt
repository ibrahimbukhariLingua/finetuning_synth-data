The plant is considered to be the largest shipyard plant in the countries bordering the Caspian Sea. Its production capacity is 25 thousand tons of metal constructions per year. The total area of the enterprise is 620 thousand square meters. Semi-station buildings have been constructed in order to provide the electrical supply to the plant. In addition, a 1630-meter-long bridge, five-story administrative building, training center, various offices and warehouses, production workshops, repairs, dining-room, medical center, and compressor building were constructed.

The plant was designed by the “Royal Haskoning” British Company and bidding was held for the project. The plant has been provided by equipment manufactured in Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, Czech Republic, Great Britain, South Korea and Singapore.

Construction of the Baku Shipyard LLC, which was jointly implemented by the AIC, SOCAR and Singapore's Keppel, was completed in the third quarter of 2013. SOCAR, Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) and Keppel Offshore & Marine Company have established “Baku Shipyard LLC” joint venture for the construction and operation of the plant. In accordance with the contract signed between the founders on 10 December 2010, SOCAR had 65%, AIC had 25%, and Keppel Offshore & Marine Company had 10% share in the charter capital of the plant.

In addition to the construction of new ships, work on repairing ships is also carried out at the plant.
