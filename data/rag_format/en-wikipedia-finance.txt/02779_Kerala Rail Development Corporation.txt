### Nilambur – Nanjangud Railway Line

The Nilambur–Nanjangud railway line also called **The Golden I T Corridor** or **Wayanad Railway** is a proposed project to establish faster interconnectivity between the two states of Kerala and Karnataka through the construction of a direct short distance broad gauge line between Nilambur in the Malappuram district of Kerala and Nanjangud in Mysore district of Karnataka. The first proposal for such a line dates back to 1881. By the successful establishment of this broad gauge line, the existing distance between Ernakulam - Mysore rail route will be reduced to 361 km (224 mi) from 776 km (482 mi) and Ernakulam - Bangalore will be reduced to 500 km (310 mi) from 637 km (396 mi). Estimated budget for this project is ₹4,000 crore (US$460 million).


### Coaching terminal complex

Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) has submitted a feasibility report to Southern Railway for the redevelopment of the marshalling yard at Ponnuruni to construct an international standard coaching terminal complex. The underutilized land here in Ponnurunni, at the heart of the city, will have the capacity to host trains, apart from having space for repair and maintenance of trains. The new terminal would become a new halt station for trains through Kottayam and will also be a terminal point for new trains that are allotted to the state. The Southern Railway has entrusted the Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd for preparing a feasibility report on the terminal in October 2020.
The proposed terminal will also ease the long-standing traffic congestion in Kochi and accelerate the development of the railways in the state. The feasibility study says the project is technically feasible and financially viable and recommended for implementation to have higher mobility, meet the traffic growth and economic development of the State. The project can be completed over three years. The feasibility report suggests a station complex with 4 platforms, 1 pit line, 2 parcel lines, 2 stabling lines, wagon examination line in addition to retaining the existing coaching depot. The expected total investment through the project is Rs 1654 crore including the development of the railway infrastructure for Rs 325 crore. The plan is in such a way that the number of passenger platforms can be increased depending on the increasing traffic demand in the future.


### Sabari railway line

Sabarimala Railway is a proposed 111 km (69 mi) railway line from Angamaly to Erumeli, (and possible extension until punalur) near Sabarimala that had been sanctioned in the year 1998 by Indian Railways. According to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Kerala State and the Ministry of Railways on 27 January 2016, commercially viable railway projects will be identified and handed over to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to be fast-tracked on a 51:49 per cent equity basis. SPV has discussed about the extension to Punalur. Kerala Rail Development corporation shows interest for constructing this new sabarimala railway line
