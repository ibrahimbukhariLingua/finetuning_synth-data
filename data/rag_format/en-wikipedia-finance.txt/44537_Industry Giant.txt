The game received "unfavorable" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. However, *Next Generation* said, "*Industry Giant* is presented well, with polished graphics and an upbeat soundtrack. It may not have mass market appeal, but it is a solid enough game to keep sim fans salivating for a long time."

The game was a commercial blockbuster, with sales above 800,000 units in Germany.
