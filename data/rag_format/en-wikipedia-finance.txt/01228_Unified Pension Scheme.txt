Unified Pension Scheme


# Unified Pension Scheme



**The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)**, introduced by the Government of India in 2024 as an optional pension scheme along with the National Pension System (NPS) for the government employees, it aims to provide a comprehensive and centralised pension system for Central government employees. The scheme is designed to consolidate various existing pension schemes, offering a more equitable and efficient approach to retirement benefits.


## Background

There have been long pending demands from the Central Government employees to introduce a more comprehensive pension system. Various opposition parties and leaders have raised the issue several times in their election speeches for the reintroduction of the Old Pension Scheme (OPS).
