**Filecoin** (**⨎**) is a cryptocurrency intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method. It was developed by Protocol Labs and shares some ideas from InterPlanetary File System allowing users to rent unused hard drive space. Filecoin is an open protocol and uses a blockchain to record participation in the network. Transactions are made using the blockchain's currency, FIL. The blockchain is based on both proof of-replication and proof of space-time.


## History

The project was launched in August 2017, and raised over $200 million within 30 minutes via an initial coin offering.

In 2020, the project set up the Filecoin Foundation under the leadership of founding officer Megan Klimen to support the development of the protocol, and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web to support other projects contributing to the ecosystem of the decentralized web.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
