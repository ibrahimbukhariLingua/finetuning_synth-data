Wealth distribution in Europe


# Wealth distribution in Europe



**Wealth** is the total sum value of monetary assets and valuable material possessions owned by an individual, minus private debt, at a set point in time.

There is a difference between median and mean wealth. Median wealth is the amount that divides the wealth distribution into two equal groups: half the adults have wealth above the median, and the other half below. Mean wealth is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate wealth by the number of adults. In nations where wealth is highly concentrated in a small percentage of people, the mean can be much higher than the median.

A Global Wealth Report is published annually by Credit Suisse. This article shows the distribution of wealth in Europe.
