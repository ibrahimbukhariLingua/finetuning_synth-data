## Career

For a period of nine years, from March 2008 until April 2017 Jolly Kaguhangire worked as an Assistant Commissioner responsible for service management at the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), the national tax agency. While there, she and the team she led, made strategic and tactical changes, leading to increased tax collection, from US$41 million in 2008 to US$1,683 million in 2015, with registered taxpayers increasing from 17,479 to 836,830 during the same time-frame. At the time she left URA, she supervised a team of people that exceeded 700 in number.

In April 2017, after a two-round, two-months search process, Kaguhangire was hired by the board, as the best candidate for the CEO position, citing her leadership experience as a factor in her hiring. One of the goals that she prioritizes at UIA, is the development of industrial and business parks in major urban centers around the county, including at Arua, Luzira, Masaka, Mbale, Mbarara, Namanve and Soroti. Another priority is to coordinate with the Uganda Export Promotion Board and the Uganda Tourism Board, in production of promotional and marketing material and performing joint exhibitions and tours, thereby reducing costs and sending a consistent and coherent message to potential investors. A third priority is the creation of a one-stop-center (OSC), where an investor can register their business and obtain all requisite permits and licenses to begin operations in the shortest time possible.
