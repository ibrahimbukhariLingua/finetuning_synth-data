The Research Board


# The Research Board



**The Research Board** was described in 1984 by *The New York Times* as "a low-profile New York group composed of chief data processing executives of 50 of the nation's largest corporations." A decade later *The Times* described it as
"a high-tech consulting firm."

Although by late 2017 a Wall Street Journal writer spoke of "The Research Board" in the past tense, this was just a technicality. Having been acquired by Gartner in 1998, it is sometimes referred to as The Gartner Research Board or The Research Board Gartner.
