Financial regulation in India


# Financial regulation in India



**Financial regulation in India** is governed by a number of regulatory bodies. Financial regulation is a form of regulation or supervision, which subjects financial institutions to certain requirements, restrictions and guidelines, aiming to maintain the stability and integrity of the financial system. This may be handled by either a government or non-government organization. Financial regulation has also influenced the structure of banking sectors by increasing the variety of financial products available. Financial regulation forms one of three legal categories which constitutes the content of financial law, the other two being market practices and case law.


## History

The history of financial regulation in India can be traced back to the early 19th century when the British East India Company established the Bank of Bengal in 1806. Over time, other banks were established, including the Bank of Bombay in 1840 and the Bank of Madras in 1843, which collectively came to be known as the Presidency Banks.

In 1921, the three Presidency Banks were merged to form the Imperial Bank of India, which was later nationalized and renamed as the State Bank of India in 1955. The Reserve Bank of India was established in 1935 as the central bank of the country, with the objective of regulating the currency and credit system of the country and promoting its economic growth.

After India gained independence in 1947, the government took several steps to regulate the financial sector. In 1949, the Banking Regulation Act was passed, which gave the Reserve Bank of India greater control over the functioning of banks and other financial institutions. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was established in 1988 to regulate the securities markets and protect the interests of investors.

In the 1990s, India embarked on a program of economic liberalization and reforms, which included significant changes in the financial sector. The Narasimham Committee was set up in 1991 to examine the state of the financial sector and make recommendations for its reform. Based on the recommendations of the committee, several measures were taken to liberalize the financial sector and promote competition.

In 1993, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act was passed, which gave SEBI statutory powers to regulate the securities markets. In 1997, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) was established to regulate the insurance sector. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) was established in 2003 to regulate the pension sector.

The Indian government has liberalized its foreign investment policies over the years, making it easier for foreign investors to invest in India.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is allowed in most sectors under the automatic route, which means that foreign investors do not require prior approval from the government or the RBI for their investment. However, certain sectors such as defense, telecom, and media require prior approval from the government.
