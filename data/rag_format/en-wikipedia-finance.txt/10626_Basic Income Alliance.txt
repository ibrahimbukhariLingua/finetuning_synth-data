Basic Income Alliance


# Basic Income Alliance



The **Basic Income Alliance** (German: *Bündnis Grundeinkommen*, abbreviated **BGE**) is a German single-issue political party that advocates for an unconditional basic income. It was founded in September 2016 in Munich. The Basic Income Alliance gained 97,539 votes at the German federal election 2017 and reached 0.2%.


## Overview

The Basic Income Alliance sees an unconditional basic income as a central possibility to counteract what it sees as a widening income gap. Technical progress, the automation of production processes, the resulting unemployment and low-paid gainful employment lead to a division in society that must be overcome in order to maintain social peace.
