## History

The origins of the Nash Finch Company can be traced back to 1885 when Fred Nash opened a small candy and tobacco shop in the Dakota Territory town of Devils Lake. Soon, Nash opened another store with his two brothers in Grand Forks, North Dakota. In the late 1880s, Edgar and Willis, the brothers, joined Fred in opening a fruit distribution business. In 1899, the Nash brothers hired Harry Finch as an employee to sort lemons. In 1904, the Nash brothers made their first acquisition of a wholesale distributor in Minot, North Dakota, while Finch acquired a warehouse in Grand Forks. Additional expansions occurred through 1912. the company later began a partnership with produce brokerage company C.H. Robinson Company, which would later acquire what would later become Nash Finch. In 1919, the company moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The brothers expanded into distribution with operations in Texas and California and, by 1921, owned over 60 companies. The same year, the Nash brothers' and Finch's companies were incorporated into a new company named Nash Finch Company. The following year, in 1922, the company began selling Nash's Toasted Coffee and other products at its stores. Finch was appointed president in 1926. In the 1930s, Nash Finch launched its private-label store brand, "Our Family", which still remains in use by SpartanNash.

In the 1950s, Nash Finch expanded its customer list to include corporate-owned chains to their existing independent mom-and-pop grocers. A 17-store supermarket chain was purchased in 1954. In 1964, Nash Finch opened up Warehouse Market, a warehouse-style store, in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

In 1976, the employees of C.H. Robinson acquired Nash Finch, becoming an employee owned company. In 1983, Nash Finch became a publicly-traded company; it was listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "NAFC". In 1984, Nash Finch acquired the North Carolinaâ€“based supermarket chain M.H. McLean, thus expanding into the southeastern United States.

In 2002, Nash Finch opened Avanza, a Hispanic-themed grocery store, followed in 2008 by Family Fresh Market, a store specializing in organic foods. In 2009, the military division of Nash Finch acquired three distribution centers. In 2012, Nash Finch acquired two chains, No Frills Supermarkets and Bag 'N Save, which operated 18 and 12 stores respectively.

The company suffered a $93 million loss by the end of 2012.
