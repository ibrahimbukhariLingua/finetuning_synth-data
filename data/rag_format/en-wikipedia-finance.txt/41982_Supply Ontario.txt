# Supply Ontario



**Supply Ontario** (**SO**; French: *ApprovisiOntario*) is a Crown agency of the Government of Ontario. Created in 2020, the agency's mandate is to provide and support supply chain management and procurement activities for the provincial government, the broader public sector, and health care sector.


## Governance and leadership

The agency was established in 2020 by the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party government of Premier Doug Ford under Ontario Regulation 612/20, made under the *Supply Chain Management Act (Government, Broader Public Sector and Health Sector Entities), 2019*. The agency was initially under the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services (MGCS), and briefly the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS). In June 2024, the agency returned to MGCS, which had since been re-named to Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery and Procurement (MPBSDP).
