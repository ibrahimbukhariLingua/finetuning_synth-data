Deep integration


# Deep integration



**Deep integration**, as defined by Simone Claar and Andrea NÃ¶lke, means trade agreements which not only contain rules on tariffs and conventional non-tariff trade restrictions, but which also regulate the business environment in a more general sense. Issues of deep integration include competition policy, investor rights, product standards, public procurement and intellectual property rights, for example.


## Canada and United States

Deep integration can also specifically refer to the harmonization of policies and regulations of Canada and the United States.


## Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru
