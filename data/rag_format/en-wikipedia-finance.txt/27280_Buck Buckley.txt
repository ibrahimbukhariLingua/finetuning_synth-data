## Early life and education

Buckley grew up in Devon, Pennsylvania and attended Episcopal Academy through high school. He then attended University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. While in college, Buckley starred on the North Carolina soccer team. He was First Team all ACC and All South for UNC. His coach, legendary Anson Dorrance recalled "He played with wonderful, physical, reckless abandon", leaving it all on the field.

Buckley and Cyrus Vandrevala co-founded Semcap in 2020. SEMCAP is a growth impact manager investing in companies at the forefront of seminal trends in three sectors-Healthcare, Education and Food & Nutrition. The company has made several investments, including NeuroFlow,SafeRide Health, Purely Elizabeth and Good Culture.


## Earlier in his career

In 1988, Buckley joined Safeguard Scientifics, a venture capital firm. From 1991 to 1996, Buckley was the Vice President of Acquisitions at Safeguard. There, he oversaw the acquisitions of a number of companies including ChromoVision, Diamond Technology, Video Server, and XL Vision.


### Internet Capital Group

Buckley and fellow Safeguard executive Ken Fox noticed an emerging market in e-commerce business-to-business and left Safeguard in February 1996 to found a venture capital firm, Internet Capital Group (later shortened to ICG). They asked Safeguard head Pete Musser for $5 million in funding, but he insisted on investing $15 million. Buckley and Fox raised $40 million to start ICG, twice what they wanted. In addition to Safeguard, major investors included Comcast, Compaq, and BancBoston Ventures.

Buckley served as the CEO and president of the company from March 1996 to December 2001, at which time he became the company's Chairman. ICG invested $1.4 billion in 61 start-up firms; and an article declared that "Buckley put B2B on the map".

In August 1999, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, offering stock for sale at $12 per share. By December 1999, the stock was trading at over $200 per share and Buckley's stake of 10,000,000 shares, or 3.5% of the company, was worth over $2 billion. By November 2000, the stock was down to $11 per share and after the September 11 attacks it traded for 20 cents per share. Buckley sold very little of his stock and remained optimistic.

After ICG survived the crash, paid down the debt and changed its business model to move towards an operating model. Instead of taking small stakes in many companies, it invested in a few "core" companies at a time, as a majority owner. This allowed the company to have much greater control over the operations of its investments. Buckley refocused the company to find strategic partnerships with traditional industry leaders such as a joint venture with DuPont called CapSpan in early 2000. In September 2014, when the company changed its name to Actua Corporation, its stock was trading around $6 per share and was worth approximately $200 million. At its closing, Actua distributed close to $18/share and provided a triple return to investors.
