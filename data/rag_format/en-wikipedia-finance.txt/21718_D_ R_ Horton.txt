## Controversies

The Supreme Court of the United States heard the appeal of a case in which the National Labor Relations Board held that the company violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by requiring its employees to sign an arbitration agreement that prohibited them from pursuing claims in a collective or class action. In 2018 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of D.R. Horton, stating that the company's actions did not violate the NLRA or the Federal Arbitration Act.
