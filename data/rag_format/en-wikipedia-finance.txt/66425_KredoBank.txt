## History

JSC West-Ukrainian Commercial Bank (ZUKB) was established in Lviv and was registered as a limited liability company in the State Bank of the former USSR on 14 May 1990 (registration number 289) and re-registered with the National Bank of Ukraine on 14 October 1991 (registration number 24). On 21 February 1992 at the General Shareholders Meeting ZUKB transformed into open joint-stock company (bank registration certificate number 96 on 31 March 1992).

In 2000, Warsaw-headquartered Kredyt Bank [pl], together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, acquired the West-Ukrainian Commercial Bank.²⁸ According to the Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting on 17 August 2001 the bank changed its name from JSC West-Ukrainian Commercial Bank to JSC Kredyt Bank (Ukraine), and therefore the Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting on 26 October 2001 made the appropriate changes in the Charter of the bank.

In 2004, the process of changing the strategic investor of JSC Kredyt Bank (Ukraine) was finished with a sale of shares (whole package - 66.65%) by Poland's Kredyt Bank to PKO Bank Polski SA. As a result, the Extraordinary General Shareholders Meeting of JSC Kredyt Bank (Ukraine) was held on 17 November 2005, where shareholders approved replacing the old name of the bank by new one, which is the open joint-stock company KredoBank. On 1 March 2006 the bank officially changed its name to PJSC KredoBank.

Since September 2013, the bank has been rebranded. On 5 September the updated logo of the bank was presented.
