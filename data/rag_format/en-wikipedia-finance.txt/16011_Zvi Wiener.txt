## Biography

Wiener also served at the Bank of Israel foreign reserves investment committee.

Wiener provides lobbying services to Bank Hapoalim, and also holds a private company, named Optimize Risk Management Ltd. According to an investigation by The Marker magazine, Wiener's private activities violate the directives of the Supervisor of Wages and Labor Agreements since he serves at the same time as Dean at the Hebrew University and founded by the Israeli government. According to Wiener these activities are in line with regulations. However, the Council for Higher Education did not confirm his claim and instruct the Hebrew University to examine Wiener's employment exception. The Enforcement Branch at the Office of the Supervisor of Wages and Labor Agreements also initiated an examination of that exception. It was also reported that Wiener has promoted a private entrepreneur's appointment at the Hebrew University immediately before the last contributed a large amount of money to the School of Business Administration at the Hebrew University.
