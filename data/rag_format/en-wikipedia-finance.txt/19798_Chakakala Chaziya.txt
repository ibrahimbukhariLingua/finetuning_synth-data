# Chakakala Chaziya



**Lynold Chakakala Chaziya** (born 11 February 1925) is a Malawian statesman, economist, and politician who served as the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank/Reserve Bank of Malawi Governor under Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda's MCP regime and also served as Board Chairperson of various parastatals/government agencies like OILCOM (the precursor of NOCMA), Limbe Leaf Tobacco Limited and various others. Born on 31st March, 1947, with his first wife Anne Kafaaiwala he had three children Lawrence, Geoffrey and Lynold Jr. At the dawn of multi-party democracy in 1992 he came together with other former cabinet ministers of Dr. Banda's era like Elson Bakili Muluzi, Edward Chitsulo Bwanali and other willing Malawians to form a pressure group United Democratic Front (UDF) championing the return of Malawi to political party pluralism as was the case in the 1960s. He was its First Vice Chairman with Dr. George Afawaka Mkandawire as Second Vice Chairman and Elson Bakili Muluzi as its Chairman.

Later the UDF was to form the new government in a new multi-party era in 1994 United Democratic Front.
