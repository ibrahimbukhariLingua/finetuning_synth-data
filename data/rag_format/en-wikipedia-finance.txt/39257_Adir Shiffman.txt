## Legal disputes and controversies

"Adir Shiffman, a self-confessed courtroom agitator, was quoted saying, 'Every day I'm not suing someone I'm agitated! Where's my litigator?'.

In June 2024, Shifman's Entity (BBHF Pty Ltd) lost a court case against sleeping duck founders. Sleeping duck is an online mattress retailer company which Shifman was serving as the chairman since 2018 with 10% share of $100,000 investment. The supreme court judge, Jim Delany, at the supreme court of Victoria dismissed Shifman's claims and ordered him to pay the court costs. Shifman had alleged that he was gradually excluded from company decisions made by sleeping duck's founders, Selvam Sinnappan and Winiston Wijeyeratne, including decisions related to rebranding, website redesigns, and marketing campaigns.

Adir Shifman has been criticized for starting allegations against Sleeping Duck. It has been alleged that Shifman joined another competing company without disclosing this fact, while he was still serving as the chairman of Sleeping Duck. As a result, Sleeping Duck has opened a counter lawsuit against Shifman. The company alleges that Shifman failed to disclose his involvement with a competitor company, while he was still holding a leadership position at Sleeping Duck. Which suggested that Shifman's allegations against Sleeping Duck may have been made in bad faith, while he was simultaneously working with a rival company.

An example prior litigation of Adir's entity BBHF Pty Ltd include Compare Forex Brokers PTY LTD in 2018.
