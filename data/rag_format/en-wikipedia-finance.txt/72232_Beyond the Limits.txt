Beyond the Limits


# Beyond the Limits



***Beyond the Limits*** is a 1992 book continuing the modeling of the consequences of a rapidly growing global population that was started in the 1972 report *Limits to Growth*. Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, and JÃ¸rgen Randers are the authors and all were involved in the original Club of Rome study as well. *Beyond the Limits* (Chelsea Green Publishing Company) and Earthscan addressed many of the criticisms of the *Limits to Growth* book, but still has caused controversy and mixed reactions.


## Influence

Billionaire investor Richard Rainwater indicates having been influenced to invest in oil in the 1990s upon reading *Beyond the Limits'*. His niece Kelley Rainwater reports she gave him this book as a Christmas present. She was introduced to the book through Dr. Jay Earley who is a social transformation theorist and colleague of the Meadows.
