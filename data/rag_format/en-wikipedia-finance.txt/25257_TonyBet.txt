## Sponsorships

TonyBet controversially became a sponsor of the Lithuania men's national basketball team in 2010, controversially because TonyBet provides betting on basketball games and because in Lithuania gambling advertising is banned nationwide.

According to TonyBet, in 2013 it became the main sponsor for the team in a four-year deal, and also was sponsoring some of the leading basketball clubs of Lithuania and Estonia, an Estonian football club, and Lithuanian and Estonian volleyball associations.
