Tun Razak Exchange


# Tun Razak Exchange



The **Tun Razak Exchange**, otherwise known as **TRX** (previously known as **Kuala Lumpur International Financial District** or **KLIFD**)*,* is a 70-acre development by Ministry of Finance Malaysia (MOF) in the heart of Kuala Lumpur for international finance and business. The development was named after the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, due to its location along Jalan Tun Razak. TRX was planned during the era of the sixth Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak and it is a strategic enabler of the Malaysian government's Economic Transformation Programme (ETP).

The master plan includes a total of 26 buildings and over 21 million ft² of Gross Floor Area (GFA) spread across the office, residential, hotel, retail, F&B and cultural offerings.

The project has a development period of 15 years to be completed in phases with the initial Phase 1 slated for completion in 2017/2018.

TRX's landmark building is The Exchange 106, currently the third tallest skyscraper in Malaysia, and was the second tallest upon completion.

## Investors


### Lendlease – The Exchange TRX

In March 2015, TRX City Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Malaysian Minister of Finance Inc., signed a Joint Venture Master Framework Agreement with Lendlease, an Australia-based property and infrastructure group to develop the TRX's Lifestyle Quarter, which has been renamed as The Exchange TRX. Lendlease has a 60% stake in the joint venture, and TRX City Sdn Bhd has the remaining 40%. The retail-led mixed-use development entered the construction phase in September 2017 after a 2-year design period, with completion expected in 2020/21. Lendlease secured an RM2.15 billion loan to complete this RM9 billion development.

It will occupy over 17 acres and would comprise a retail mall (The Exchange TRX) located underneath a 10-acre central park (TRX City Park), 6 residential towers (TRX Residences) and a luxury hotel (Malaysia's first Kimpton Hotel, with 471 rooms) connected to the multi-layered central park as well as the Tun Razak Exchange MRT station. The central park will connect all the buildings within TRX using tumbling, terraced greenery, water features and shaded sections. Once completed, the development has a forecast gross development value of over RM9.5 billion. The Exchange TRX, with a nett lettable area of 120,773 square metres, will be a shopping, dining (with five F&B precincts offering local, international and rooftop luxury dining experiences), leisure and entertainment destination featuring over 500 shops.

In October 2017, Lendlease Development Malaysia Sdn Bhd said that more than 26% of the Exchange had been successfully leased to three anchor tenants:

* Seibu Department Store (occupying 250,000 sq ft, first department store to brought *depachika* food hall concept to Malaysia, occupying 250,000 sq ft space)
* Dairy Farm Group, parent of Cold Storage & Giant (In 2023, Cold Storage & Giant businesses were acquired by Macrovalue Sdn Bhd., effectively taking over the space. Under its new owners, the mall's supermarket will be under Cold Storage's Mercato brand, occupying 23,000 sq ft)
* Golden Screen Cinemas (offering new cinematic experiences)

It has appointed IJM Construction Sdn Bhd as the contractor to undertake the HSBC Malaysia headquarters' design and construction for a contract sum of approximately RM392 million (excluding lifts and facade works).

### Veolia Water – Water Treatment and Recycling

TRX signed a 20-year concession agreement with Veolia Water Technologies Southeast Asia in September 2014, for wastewater treatment and recycled water supply in TRX.
