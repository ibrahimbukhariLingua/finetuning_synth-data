## History

In 1888 Jean Villiger founded a small tobacco factory, in his native village of Pfeffikon, Switzerland. He died early in 1902 and the business was subsequently managed by his wife Louise (née Ottiger) since the children were still minors. In 1910 Louise Villiger founded the first subsidiary of the company, in nearby Tiengen, Grand Duchy of Baden. Today this branch is even larger than the Swiss headquarters founded over twenty years earlier (Villiger Söhne GmbH). After her sons reached legal age and returned from gaining professional experience abroad (specifically in the United States for Max) they took-over the company in the early 1920s. The management was now with Max Villiger (1897–1966) and his brother Hans Villiger (1892–1981). They were responsible for building the company into a multinational concern and international brand.

Due to Hans not having children, Max's children gradually entered the company. Heinrich Villiger (born 1930) who intended to study economics, was the first one and passed on his studies after completing the Matura, and was instead educated in the tobacco trade. He currently still chairs and has the controlling interest of the family business. He is believed to be the oldest tobacco manufacturer in the world who is still active in daily business. The middle daughter, Monika Villiger (born 1936), became a member of the company only in 1967 when she joined as export director. She would later become a curator of history and engages in municipal civic organizations such as the tobacco museum. The youngest child and son of the family, Kaspar Villiger, would be a majority shareholder of the concern until his election into Federal Council (Switzerland) in 1989. He served one term as President of the Swiss Confederation in 1995.

Since 1989 Villiger is managed by Heinrich Villiger (and his descendants). He founded the first joint venture together with Cuban partners for the exclusive import and distribution of Havanna cigars in Germany, which is known as Fifth Avenue Trading Products GmbH. The company has several subsidiaries. Since 2016 they have a permanent office in the United States (Villiger North America Inc.) and in 2020 they opened a new production facility in Esteli, Nicaragua.
