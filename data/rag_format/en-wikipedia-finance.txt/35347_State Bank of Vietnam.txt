State Bank of Vietnam


# State Bank of Vietnam



The **State Bank of Vietnam** (**SBV**; Vietnamese: *Ngân hàng Nhà nước Việt Nam*) is the central bank of Vietnam. Organized as a ministry-level body under the Government of Vietnam, it is the sole issuer of the national currency, the Vietnamese đồng. As of 2024 it holds over USD 100 million in foreign exchange reserves.


## History

When Indochina was under French rule, the colonial government governed the Indochinese monetary system through Banque de l'Indochine, which also acted as a commercial bank in French Indochina.

After the August Revolution in 1945, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam gradually attempted to exercise a monetary system independent from France. On 6 May 1951, president Hồ Chí Minh signed decree 15/SL on establishment of Vietnam National Bank (*Ngân hàng Quốc gia Việt Nam*). On 21 January 1960, the governor of the bank signed an ordinance on behalf of the prime minister to rename the bank State Bank of Vietnam (*Ngân hàng Nhà nước Việt Nam*).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

After the fall of Saigon, the two Vietnams were united but not until July 1976 did the two countries’ administrations and institutions unite. In July 1976, the National Bank of Vietnam (the central bank of Republic of Vietnam) was merged into the State Bank of Vietnam.

In the Đổi Mới liberalisation era, the banking system of Vietnam was reformed. New banks were created, starting with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Vietnam (VietinBank - now the largest listed bank) and the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture in 1988, and the role of the State Bank was gradually narrowed to that of a central bank. In 1990, an ordinance reorganised the state bank and redefined its function as: "on behalf of the State, of managing money, credit, and banking operations throughout the country in order to stabilize a value of money, and is the only agency with power to circulate the currency of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam" While the State Bank continued to lend to state-owned enterprises in the following years, it has now been largely superseded in the respect by other state-owned banks and by private banks.


## Buildings

Several of the State Bank of Vietnam’s buildings are inherited from the Banque de l'Indochine. These include the State Bank’s headquarters in Hanoi, former Hanoi office completed in 1930; the Ho Chi Minh City branch, former central office in Indochina, also completed in 1930; and the branches in Haiphong (completed in 1925) and Nam Định (completed in 1929) among others.


## Functions and roles

The State Bank of Vietnam is a ministry-level body under the administration of the government; the bank governor is a member of the cabinet (equivalent to a minister in the cabinet).

## Controversies and corruption cases

The former prime minister, Nguyễn Tấn Dũng, was a governor of the bank while he held the post of senior deputy prime minister, but later bestowed the governor's post upon Le Duc Thuy. In 2007, controversy surrounded the purchase of the state house by governor Le Duc Thuy when he bought a house belonging to the bank at one tenth of the market value and, the government stopped the deal when the media reported the purchase. There has been criticism of the printing quality of the then new polymer đồng banknotes.

In 2024, a former State Bank of Vietnam official accused of accepting $5.2 million in bribes faced trial in conjunction with the 2022 arrest of Trương Mỹ Lan and the near failure of Sai Gon Joint Stock Commercial Bank.
