Yunus Social Business


# Yunus Social Business



**Yunus Social Business** (**YSB**) is a non-profit organisation with an impact-investing arm, Yunus Funds, and a corporate social-innovation consulting arm, Yunus Corporate Innovation. Both business units are based on furthering the concept of social business.

YSB was co-founded by Muhammad Yunus, Saskia Bruysten and Sophie Eisenmann in 2011. Its stated mission is to "harness the power of business to end poverty and the climate crisis."


## History

Prior to co-founding Yunus Social Business, Muhammad Yunus pioneered the field of micro-finance through Grameen Bank in his home country of Bangladesh. Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize for establishing microfinance and trying to tackle poverty. Grameen Bank became the first of several social businesses that Muhammad Yunus founded.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2008, Muhammad Yunus and future YSB co-founder Saskia Bruysten met at the London School of Economics, where Muhammad Yunus was giving a talk on the promise of social business. Later, they exchanged contact information. This encounter led the former management consultant, Bruysten, to visit some of Muhammad Yunus' social businesses in Bangladesh. Bruysten then started setting up Grameen Creative Lab with a German entrepreneur, where her former BCG colleague Sophie Eisenmann later joined. In 2011, the trio agreed to co-found Yunus Social Business beyond Bangladesh.

YSB is active in six countries, with local offices in Brazil, Colombia, India, Kenya and Uganda.

## Partnerships


### COVID Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship

In 2020, YSB, together with the World Economic Forum co-initiated the COVID Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship. The initiative brought 100 social-impact organisations together to try to support social businesses. The Alliance states that:

> Members of the Alliance commit to and call on their peers to stand by social entrepreneurs in their capacity as front-line responders to the health crisis and as pioneers of a green, inclusive society and economic system.


### Unusual Pioneers

Unusual Pioneers is a social-intrapreneurship accelerator for corporations. It was co-initiated in 2021 by Yunus Social Business, the World Economic Forum's Schwab Foundation and Porticus. Participants in the 2021 cohort included social intrapreneurs representing Suez, Novartis, Unilever, Tata Trust, Accenture, ClubMed, Axa, Mastercard, and others.


### Take a Stake Consortium

The Take a Stake Consortium is a funding initiative by the Yunus Social Business and Waste Foundation, launched in 2021. The consortium has been joined by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency and IKEA Social Entrepreneurship. Take a Stake aims to close a funding gap in the WASH and waste sectors, initially in East Africa and India.


### Social Success Note

The Social Success Note was created by Yunus Funds, the Rockefeller Foundation and the UBS Optimus Foundation, aiming to finance underfunded sectors and populations. The Social Success Note is an outcome-based financing mechanism in which a commercial bank is incentivized to lend to social businesses by a donor, who provides a grant to the commercial bank representing market returns (in addition to the social business' loan repayments) when the social business meets predefined objectives.


### Core partnerships

BCG has been a core partner of Yunus Social Business since 2013. BCG has provided YSB with pro-bono consulting projects, created a secondee programme where BCG consultants can work for YSB and provided pro-bono consulting projects directly to YSB portfolio social businesses. YSB is one of BCG's five global impact partnerships.

Freshfields has been a core partner of YSB since YSB was first legally incorporated in 2011. Since then, Freshfields has provided pro-bono legal services to YSB on an ongoing basis.
