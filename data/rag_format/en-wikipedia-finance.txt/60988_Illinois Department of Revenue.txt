Illinois Department of Revenue


# Illinois Department of Revenue



The **Illinois Department of Revenue** (**IDOR**) is the code department of the Illinois state government that collects state taxes, operates the state lottery, oversees the state's casino industry, oversees the state's thoroughbred and harness horse racing industries, and regulates the distribution of alcoholic beverages throughout Illinois, including beer, wine, and liquor. It is headquartered at the Willard Ice Building, 101 West Jefferson in Springfield, Illinois.


## History

The Illinois Department of Revenue has increased in size in line with the creation of new taxes within the state and the expansion of existing taxes. A gasoline tax was enacted in Illinois in 1927, the sales tax was enacted in 1933; the state income tax was enacted in 1969, and the first lottery tickets were sold in 1974 in the state capital of Springfield.

In fiscal year 2007, the Illinois Department of Revenue expected to collect $24.6 billion in taxes and gambling revenues, about five-sixths of the state's general funds revenues for the year. IDOR expected to keep $1.0 billion of this sum (4.0%) to cover the costs of its own operations, and expected to transfer the rest to the office of the Illinois State Treasurer to pay for the ongoing operations of the state.


## Organization

The Illinois Department of Revenue collects taxes on its own behalf and oversees the operations of three quasi-independent state boards and commissions, as follows:

* The *Illinois Gaming Board* regulates Illinois casinos

* The *Illinois Racing Board* regulates Illinois horse racetracks;
* The *Illinois Liquor Control Commission* regulates the distribution of alcoholic beverages in Illinois.

## Today

In 2018, IDOR Launched a Statewide Electronic Lien Registry in order to provide a single-source to locate all active liens and releases filed by the department.
