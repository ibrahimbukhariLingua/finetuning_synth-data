The bank also had a subsidiary in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Komercijalna banka a.d. with headquarters in Banja Luka.

As of December 2014, two of the bank's biggest stakeholders were the Government of Serbia with 42.6% and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) with 25% of shares.

In March 2015, the bank's management announced that Government of Serbia plans to sell its stake in the bank in the second half of 2017. However, the auction was postponed several times. In June 2019, the Government of Serbia increased its stake in ownership by acquiring 6.8% of shares from DEG and Swedfund International for 43.7 million euros.
