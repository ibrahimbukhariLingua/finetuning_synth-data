# CRCC Asia



**CRCC Asia** was founded in 2006 to provide students and young professionals work experience.


## History

CRCC Asia was founded in September 2006 by Daniel Nivern and Edward Holroyd Pearce. They met during a master's degree program in international management for China at the University of London. It was there that they realized the high potential of the Asian labor market and its culture.

They started the company to open the borders between Asia and the Western countries. With a personal investment of £250 each, they opened the first office in London at the end of 2007. In 2008, Tom Kirkwood, an entrepreneur with over 20 years of business experience in China, became a strategic partner in the company.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The CRCC Asia team consists of over 60 employees.

With three locations in Mainland China; two locations in Japan; and programs in Vietnam, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, CRCC Asia offers a wide range of experiences spanning various career fields, cultural environments, and employability skills.

CRCC Asia Ltd also owns equity stakes in a number of diverse organisations.

CRCC Asia conducted the first China–Israel Internship Program (CIIP) in 2017.

CIIP provides a select number of Israeli nationals the opportunity to gain business experience in China by studying and interning for a period of three months in Beijing. The candidates are required to return to Israel after the end of the program.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
