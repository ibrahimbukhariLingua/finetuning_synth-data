## History

NACM was founded in 1896 and has been active in its advocacy agenda for more than 100 years in Washington, DC, lobbying during the crafting of relevant legislation. Among its federal legislative priority issues in 2015 were bankruptcy reform, the Federal Trade Commission’s “Red Flags Rules” and the 3% withholding tax issues.

The association’s international arm is Finance, Credit & International Business (FCIB). FCIB provides education, seminars, credit groups and reporting designed for the international credit professional. In 2011, the division launched its “Doing Business in…” series to highlight key details of credit and collections dealings, notably for emerging economies such as Brazil, China and South Korea.

In 2016 NACM created a new division, the "Mechanic’s Lien and Bond Services" division, which includes information and services pertaining to various commercial construction-related matters as well as state and federal laws governing lien and bond rights and processes.
