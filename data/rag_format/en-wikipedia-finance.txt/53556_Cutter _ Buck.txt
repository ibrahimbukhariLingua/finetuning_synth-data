## Wire Fraud

In 2003, Cutter & Buck's former CFO, Stephen S. Lowber, pleaded guilty to felony wire fraud relating to lying about the company's revenue in 2000. The Cutter & Buck corporation paid no fines for these misstatements; however, it did agree with the SEC to stronger accounting practices.
