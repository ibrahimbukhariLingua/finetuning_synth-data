# Industrial Research Institute



**Innovation Research Interchange** (**IRI**) is a division of the National Association of Manufacturers, a nonprofit association based in Washington, D. C., United States. IRI was founded as a private non-profit association in 1938 and merged with the NAM in 2022. IRI's mission is "*To enhance the innovation leader's and innovation teams' ability to create new value and growth by providing platforms and learning opportunities to share best and next practices, improving team and individual competencies, providing strategic information on the future of innovation execution and leadership, and enhancing and supporting a vibrant community for innovation leadership."*


## History

IRI held its first meeting on February 25, 1938, after the National Research Council established it as a branch within its Division of Engineering and Industrial Research (DEIR). IRI's original membership consisted of fourteen companies; the organization's first president was Maurice Holland, then director of DEIR. On April 17, 1945, IRI separated from the National Research Council and formed a nonprofit, 501(c)(6) organization, incorporated in the State of New York.
