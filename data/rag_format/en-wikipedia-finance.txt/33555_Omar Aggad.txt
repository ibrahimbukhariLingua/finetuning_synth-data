*The Wall Street Journal* noted that "Aggad is considered one of Saudi Arabia's most savviest and professional managers. In a book about Arabian merchants, British writer Michael Fields called him "bold and impulsive, an intuitive decision-taker with a huge head for detail." As a partner with other Saudi and foreign investors, Aggad operated 23 manufacturing plants scattered across Saudi Arabia."

He was a founding shareholder and director of InvestCorp Bank and a founding director of the Saudi British Bank while serving on the board of directors for 20 years.

After the Oslo process, and having been historically supportive of Palestine, Aggad decided to create an entity to invest and create jobs in his historic homeland, and thus he founded the Arab Palestinian Investment Company (APIC).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
