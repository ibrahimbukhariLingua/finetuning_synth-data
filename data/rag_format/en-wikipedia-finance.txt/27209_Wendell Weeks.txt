## Career

In 1996, Weeks was named vice president and general manager of Corning's optical fiber business, a tenure which included managing through a major sales downturn.

### Non-executive roles

Weeks is a member of the national Business Roundtable and has been a member of the board of directors of Amazon.com since February 2016.


### Business philosophy

Weeks has said that "If you’re going to sustain as an institution, you have to focus on problems that matter. For Corning, some of those things are cleaner air; safer, more effective medicines; and fast, reliable communication. A company’s value is ultimately measured by whether or not it does good in society." He believes that creative destruction is an important part of capitalism, but so is collaboration. He regards failures as opportunities to learn.


## Personal life

Weeks met his wife, Kim Frock, at Harvard Business School. She worked at Corning and helped initiate and volunteered with a local school project. They have two children.
