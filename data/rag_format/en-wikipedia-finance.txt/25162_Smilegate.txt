### *Crossfire*

Every year, Smilegate organizes an international *Crossfire* tournament with a prize pool of approximately 1 billion KRW titled CFS (CrossFire Stars). CFS has the largest scale among all tournaments held by video game companies in South Korea.

Smilegate made a tremendous amount of revenue from *Crossfire* ever since its release. With the success of *Crossfire*, Smilegate was nominated as one of <THE TOP 30 DEVELOPERS> by Game Developer.

According to a list made in 2014 by SuperData Research, *Crossfire* made the most amount of revenue among all F2P games worldwide.

*Crossfire* was the worldâ€™s most played game until *League of Legends* took the first place in 2017.


### *Lost Ark*

Lost Ark is a PC MMORPG developed by Smilegate RPG. *Lost Ark* was first released in South Korea in 2018 costing approximately 100 million KRW during the 7 years of development. It became increasingly popular in 2021 and became one of the top trending games in South Korea.

In February 2022, the game was launched in Northern America and Europe via Steam. Lost Ark reached more than 1.32 million concurrent users on Steam, becoming the most played game on the platform. The record of 1.32 million concurrent users is the second place in the entire history of Steam, the first place being 3.25 million concurrent users of *PUBG: Battlegrounds*. Considering that *Lost Ark* was only released in North America and Europe, some argue that *Lost Ark* was more impactful than *PUBG: Battlegrounds*, which was released in China as well.

It became Smilegate's first successful title in the West, with the United States at one point accounting more than half of its revenue.
