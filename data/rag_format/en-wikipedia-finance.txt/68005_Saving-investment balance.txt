Saving-investment balance


# Saving-investment balance



In economics, **saving-investment balance** or **I-S balance** is a balance of national savings and national investment, which is equal to current account. This relationship is obtained from the national income identity.


## Description

This is the national income identity:

where

* Y: GDP,
* C: national consumption,
* I: national investment,
* G: government spending,
* EX: export,
* IM: import,
* EXÔºçIM: current account.

The national income identity can be rewritten as following:

where T is defined as tax. (Y-T-C) is savings of private sector and (T-G) is savings of government. Here, we define S as National savings (= savings of private sector + savings of government) and rewrite the identity as following:

This identity implies that the difference of national savings and national investment is equal to current account.
