**Bentley Systems, Incorporated** is an American-based software development company that develops, manufactures, licenses, sells and supports computer software and services for the design, construction, and operation of infrastructure. The company's software serves the building, plant, civil, and geospatial markets in the areas of architecture, engineering, construction (AEC) and operations. Their software products are used to design, engineer, build, and operate large constructed assets such as roadways, railways, bridges, buildings, industrial plants, power plants, and utility networks. The company re-invests 20% of their revenues in research and development.

Bentley Systems is headquartered in Exton, Pennsylvania, United States, but has development, sales and other departments in over 50 countries. In 2021, the company generated revenue of $1 billion in 186 countries.

In 2024, it continues to sell software lines such as MicroStation and ProjectWise, as well as several dozen others such as SYNCHRO and OpenRoads Designer.


## History

Keith A. Bentley and Barry J. Bentley founded Bentley Systems in 1984. They introduced the commercial version of PseudoStation in 1985, which allowed users of Intergraph's VAX systems to use low-cost graphics terminals to view and modify the designs on their Intergraph IGDS (Interactive Graphics Design System) installations. Their first product was shown to potential users who were polled as to what they would be willing to pay for it. They averaged the answers, arriving at a price of $7,943. A DOS-based version of MicroStation was introduced in 1986.

In April 2002, Bentley filed for an initial public offering, but it was withdrawn before taking effect. In November 2016, German-based Siemens announced it would pay about $76 million for a minority stake in Bentley, as well as invest in developing joint software with it. In September 2020, Bentley Systems sets terms of its IPO valuing the company at about $4.96 billion. The company would offer 10.75 million shares priced between $17 and $19 per share. In October 2024, Bentley Systems began using Google 2D and 3D geospatial content in some of its software. Nicholas Cumins was Bentley chief officer.
