Komenda Sugar Factory


# Komenda Sugar Factory



**Komenda Sugar Development Company Limited** (also known as **Komenda Sugar Factory**) is a Ghanaian factory established in 1964 and its operations ground to a halt in the early 1990s. This was due to poor management and technical issues.

In 2016, Government secured a $35 million loan from the Indian Export-Import Bank, followed by an additional $24 million investment to revamp the operations of the sugar factory.


## Revival

The sugar factory collapsed and it was inaugurated by the erstwhile John Mahama government in 2016. This was made possible by a loan facility of 35 million dollars from an Indian EXIM Bank.
