# Highview Power



**Highview Power** is a long-duration energy storage pioneer, specialising in liquid air energy storage (LAES). LAES stores excess renewable energy by cooling air to a liquid and then converting back to renewable energy when there is demand from the grid.

It is based in the United Kingdom, with an office in Central London as well as 2 international offices (Dubai and Australia).

In June 2024 Highview Power secured the backing of the UK Infrastructure Bank and the energy industry leader Centrica with a £300 million investment for the first commercial-scale liquid air energy storage (LAES) plant in the UK.

The £300 million funding round was led by the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB) and the British multinational energy and services company Centrica, alongside a syndicate of investors including Rio Tinto, Goldman Sachs, KIRKBI and Mosaic Capital.

The investment will enable the construction of one of the world’s largest long duration energy storage (LDES) facilities in Carrington, Manchester, using Highview Power’s proprietary LAES technology. Once complete, it will have a storage capacity of 300 MWh and an output power of 50 MW for six hours. Construction will begin on the site immediately, with the facility operational in early 2026, supporting over 700 jobs in construction and the supply chain.
