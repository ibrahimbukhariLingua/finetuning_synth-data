Federal Financial Supervisory Authority


# Federal Financial Supervisory Authority



The **Federal Financial Supervisory Authority** (German: *Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht*), better known by its abbreviation **BaFin**, is Germany's integrated financial regulatory authority. Since 2014, it has been Germany's national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. It is an independent federal institution with headquarters in Bonn and Frankfurt and falls under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Finance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ BaFin supervises about 2,700 banks, 800 financial services institutions, and over 700 insurance undertakings.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## History


### 1930s beginnings

Prudential banking supervision in Germany essentially started as a consequence of the banking crisis of 1931, prior to which the only supervised credit institutions were the public savings banks.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On 19 September 1931, a decree established the office of *Reichskommissar für das Bankgewerbe* (lit. 'Imperial Commissioner for Banking'), for which Chancellor Heinrich Brüning appointed Friedrich Ernst [de].ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 1934, this was transformed into the *Aufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen*,⁵⁹⁸ by new comprehensive banking legislation (German: *Kreditwesengesetz* of 5 December 1931).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Initially the Reichsbank was associated with the supervisory process through a newly established Supervisory Office, but that role was transferred to the Economics Minister (German: *Reichswirtschaftsminister*) upon a legislative revision in 1939, and the *Aufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen* itself was dissolved in 1944 with its duties taken over by the economics ministry.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### *Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen*

After World War II, banking supervision was devolved in West Germany to the Länder, until a national banking supervisor was re-established in 1962 as the Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen [de] (known as BAK or BAKred), located in West Berlin, which again cooperated closely with the Deutsche Bundesbank.²⁰¹–²⁰² BAKred relocated from Berlin to Bonn in 1999.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Creation of BaFin and early development

BaFin was formed on 1 May 2002 by the merger of the *Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen*, the Federal Insurance Supervisory Office (German: *Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Versicherungswesen [de]* or BAV, est. 1952 in West Berlin and relocated to Bonn in 2000), and the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading (German: *Bundesaufsichtsamt für den Wertpapierhandel [de]* or BAWe, est. 1995 in Frankfurt).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This was achieved under the Financial Services and integration Act (German: *Gesetz über die integrierte Finanzaufsicht*, known as FinDAG) enacted on 22 April 2002.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The aim was to create one integrated financial regulator that covered all financial markets. Thus, uniform national supervision of banks, credit institutions, insurance companies, financial service companies, brokers and stock exchanges would be achieved, providing transparency and manageability and to make sure all financial activity was regulated.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2003 changes to the *Kreditwesengesetz* (KWG) gave BaFin further responsibility to monitor the creditworthiness of financial institutions and to collect detailed information from those institutions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The aim was to increase customer protection and the reputation of the financial system.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It shares responsibility here with the Bundesbank. As of 2015, BaFin is in transition, after major responsibilities for banking supervision shifted to the purview of the European Central Bank in November 2014.


### Financial crisis and aftermath

On 19 September 2008, in response to threats from the 2007–2008 financial crisis and following measures taking by the United States, BaFin banned short selling on eleven German finance stocks.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ These were Aareal Bank, Allianz, AMB Generali, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Börse, Deutsche Postbank, Hannover Re, Hypo Real Estate, MLP AG and Munich Re. The ban expired on the 31 January 2010 and was not renewed at that time.

On 19 May 2010, in response to 2010 European sovereign debt crisis, BaFin banned naked short selling of credit default swaps on euro-area government bonds until 31 March 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ At the same time they re-introduced a ban on naked short selling of the previous 10 banks and insurers companies.

In 2019, BaFin banned short-selling in response to accusations of accounting fraud in Wirecard.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Following the allegations, BaFin itself came under scrutiny the following year. In November 2020, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published the results of its review which assessed the events leading to the collapse of Wirecard and the supervisory response by BaFin.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This review identifies a number of deficiencies, inefficiencies and legal and procedural impediments relating to the following areas: the independence of BaFin from issuers and government; market monitoring by both BaFin and the Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP); examination procedures of FREP; and the effectiveness of the supervisory system in the area of financial reporting. In April 2021, German prosecutors in Frankfurt announced the opening of a criminal investigation into BaFin's supervision of Wirecard.

In December 2021, BaFin fined Deutsche Bank 8.66 million euros ($9.77 million) for controls related to the Euribor interest rate, the first fine imposed under a 2018 regulation that seeks to prevent manipulation of Euribor.

In May 2022, the Federal Ministry of Finance gave BaFin more leeway and independence in conducting its work.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ According to new cooperation principles between the two authorities, BaFin is to only inform the ministry in critical cases, for example when a large corporation is involved or if there is an impact on financial markets stability.

In August 2022, BaFin fined Bank of America 5.1 million euros ($5.28 million) for delays in reporting voting rights notifications.


## Operations

The main task of BaFin is the supervision of banks, insurance companies, and the trading of securities and ensure the viability, integrity, and stability of the German financial system.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On the supply side, it pays attention to the solvency of banks, insurance companies, and financial institutions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ For investors, bank customers, and the insured it ensures confidence in the financial markets and the companies operating therein.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

BaFin is run by a Board consisting of the president and four executive directors for securities, banking supervision, insurance supervision and cross-functional areas and internal administration.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In addition to these divisions, the so-called "operational pillars", there are a number of departments that have cross-organizational or perform administrative tasks, such as "risk modeling", "money laundering" and "international responsibilities".ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

BaFin employs roughly 2,530 at its two offices and is fully funded by fees and levies of the supervised institutions and companies and so is independent of the federal budget.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The levy amounts depend on the scope and authorization of total assets.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ An appeal to the Constitutional Court regarding the unconstitutionality of this (forced) levy in 2009 was rejected as unfounded.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In the opinion of the court, the levy is 'intended to strengthen investor confidence and the soundness and integrity of these companies.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ These are a necessary condition for a functioning financial framework'.

As of December 2014, BaFin regulated approximately 1,780 banks, 676 financial services institutions, 573 insurance companies, 31 pension funds, 6,000 domestic investment funds and 260 investment companies.


### Accounts supervision

To maintain the integrity and stability of the financial system and combat money laundering BaFin is obliged, under the Banking Act, to run a centralized computer system that stores information on all accounts and their account holders.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This information must be provided to BaFin by all financial institutions in Germany.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Banking

The Banking Act (KWG) is the legal basis for banking supervision by BaFin. It monitors compliance with the rules and guidelines of the Banking Act relating to credit and financial institutions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The establishment of new banks in Germany is subject to a compulsory license subject to law, BaFin, as the competent authority, approves such licenses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It takes into account the management, minimum capital requirements, reliability, solid leadership, and the sustainability of the business when approving licenses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In particular, the financial condition of solvency and liquidity, including having appropriate risk control - and management systems as described in the MaRisk-circulaire.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Financial institutions must provide BaFin with:

* the financial statements and audit reports
* the banks and financial service Kurzbilanzen
* monthly reports on wholesale and retail loans
* regularly demonstrations their compliance with the liquidity and solvency regulation

All information will be assessed and evaluated in close cooperation with the Deutsche Bundesbank. In addition, BaFin may order special tests, which are also carried out by members of the Bundesbank on the spot.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Banking Law provides BaFin an extensive arsenal of sanctions including criminal sanctions, ranging from written warnings of fines to withdrawal of banking license.


### Insurance

Similar to bank supervision, the Insurance Supervision Law (VAG) requires insurance companies to receive and maintain their business with the approval of BaFin, and the conditions are similar to those of banking supervision.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ BaFin supervises insurance companies (including pension and burial funds), holding companies, security, and pension funds.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This excludes insurers that operate in only one province.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The supervisor shall include the monitoring of security assets and solvency to ensure that insurance contracts can be met.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Securities

BaFin is required to ensure the functioning of the German markets for securities and derivatives in accordance with the Securities Trading Act (WpHG).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This includes in particular the prevention of insider trading and other market abuses such as price and market manipulation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

As part of this BaFin collects information on all securities traded as well as disclosures from listed companies from all market participants.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This information is used to detect insider trading, price, and market manipulation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In particular, the buying and selling of shares by company management in the same company is monitored closely (Directors Dealings).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ BaFin also ensures market transparency by supervising reporting rules and disclosure requirements and makes sure these are followed.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

BaFin enforcement powers range from the issuing of subpoenas and questioning people, suspending or prohibition trading in financial instruments up to being able to forward cases to the public prosecutor.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Since 2002, under the *Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act* (German: *Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz, WpÜG*), it also deals with monopoly issues during mergers and acquisitions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

BaFin acts as the central depository for prospectus, however, BaFin only checks basic information and does not check for the accuracy and creditworthiness of the issuer.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### The role of the BaFin in law enforcement

BaFin is in effect a law enforcement agency and can initiate legal action. It has the right, when it discovers a crime or even the suspicion of a crime, in particular insider trading, market manipulation, illegal operation of banking, financial fraud, or incitement to establish stock exchange speculation, to forward them to law enforcement authorities.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ BaFin also has the power to remove the top leaders of a bank, suspend shareholders' voting rights or appoint an outside supervisor to oversee management.

In the past, BaFin has hardly ever made use of its enforcement powers and typically resolved issues discreetly with any bank. Notably, the agency appointed special representatives with executive authority to help to run the European arm of VTB Bank (2022) and the German unit of Ziraat Bank (2022).

In 2016, BaFin opened a new office dedicated to corporate whistleblowers, aiming to encourage more business insiders to expose wrongdoing.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The new office centralizes the collection of details from whistleblowers and follows a special protocol to ensure identities are kept secret. It can also be contacted anonymously under the procedure.

## Controversy

Soon after its establishment, there were signs that there were serious shortcomings within the internal structure of BaFin. An examination by the German Federal Court of Audit (Bundesrechnungshof) in Koblenz noted in March 2004 that the internal control system of authority is insufficient.

In 2006, the Federal Court revealed the embezzlement of more than 4 million euro by Michael Raumann, the former head of information technology at BaFin, for which he was indicted and convicted by the Bonn district court. In the sentencing notes the court criticized BaFin for its "nonexistent" internal controls.

In September 2006 a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and BaFin internal audit found that the requirements of the federal government to prevent corruption had not been implemented.


### BaFin list of default risk of German banks

In April 2009 an internal BaFin list containing the volume of loans and securities "from troubled business" and banks was leaked to the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. The internal paper estimated the volume of debt to be 816 billion euros. This confidential information was seen as potentially damaging to the creditworthiness of the banks and their sustainability and was seen as a serious breach by BaFin.

Shortly after the publication of the information, BaFin asked the Munich public prosecutor's to raise a criminal complaint against persons unknown on suspicion of breach of statutory duty of confidentiality.

BaFin created a working group together with the Federal Lawyer's Chamber, Assessor accountant, notaries, tax advisers and public accountants. The main objective of this group is to define "indications of possible money laundering activities" in connection with the work of the professions represented in this group. Furthermore, the Federal Chamber is in the process of establishing special Guidelines for its members, particularly in the interpretation of the Money Laundering Act.


### Wirecard

Accusations of suspect accounting at Wirecard were levelled in 2008, 2015 and 2016 and 2019. Each time Wirecard alleged market manipulation, sparking investigations by BaFin which defended the company. Wirecard wound up in 2020 and its CEO was arrested, sparking criticism of BaFin itself. The Federal Ministry of Finance later disclosed that one fifth of BaFin staff had engaged in some kind of investment activity in 2019 and 2020, with an increasing interest in Wirecard in the months ahead of its collapse. Only in September 2020, BaFin banned its staff from trading shares and other securities of the companies that it oversees.
