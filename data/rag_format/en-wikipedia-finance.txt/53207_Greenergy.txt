## History

Greenergy acquired the growing nationwide dealer network Inver Energy Ltd, headquartered in Cork, Ireland, for an undisclosed amount in early 2017.

It acquired a refinery from Texaco in Cardiff from 2006, acquiring 100% of the facility and expanding it in 2010.

Inver Energy had started as local oil and fuel distributor, expanded into marine fuels when it acquired that business from Maxol.

In 2016, Inver Energy recorded a €5.7 million pre-tax profit last year on turnover of €485.9 million, employing 25 people, providing around 10% of Ireland's marine fuel needs.

In March 2024, Trafigura agreed to acquire Greenergy's European business from Brookfield Asset Management and Brookfield Business Partners. At that time, Greenergy had manufacturing plants in the UK and the Netherlands. Trafigura increased its stake in May 2024.
