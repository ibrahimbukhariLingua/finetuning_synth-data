List of largest recorded music markets


# List of largest recorded music markets



The world's **largest recorded music markets** are listed annually by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The ranking is based on retail value (rather than units) each market generates respectively per year; retail value generated by each market varies from year to year. As all financial data is given in US dollars, annual rates of change for all countries other than the United States are heavily influenced by exchange rate fluctuations, as well as by actual changes in revenue in local currency terms.

The information presented in this page only accounts for revenue generated from the recorded music industry (recorded music and auxiliary revenues generated by these recordings), and is not reflective of the entirety of the music industry, including sectors such as publishing, live music, etc.

The United States has remained the biggest market for recorded music in IFPI history, except in 2010 when Japan topped the list. The largest Asian music market, Japan has alwaysᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ stayed within the top two. The other largest music markets by region include the United Kingdom in Europe, Australia in Oceania, and Brazil in South America. Meanwhile, United States, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada have consistently appeared among the top ten music markets throughout IFPI history. Other countries historically having appeared in the top ten include Italy, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, China, Russia, and Mexico.
