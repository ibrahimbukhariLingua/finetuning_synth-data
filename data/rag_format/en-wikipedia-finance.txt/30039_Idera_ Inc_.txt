## History

Idera was founded in 2000 by Tien Gah "Alan" Lee to create developer tools beginning with the original JSync product. Alan was head of development and secretary of the company. The company was led by President John Mercadante and CFO Matt Jordan. In October 2003 Idera was sold to PointSecure, Inc owned by Rick Pleczko.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Rick Pleczko founded BBS Technologies in 2000. The company produced a line of server backup software products later under the name Idera, competing for business with Imceda and later Red Gate Software.

BBS acquired web hosting backup provider R1Soft in late November 2007. It existed as a separate division until 2012, when its continuous data protection product was rolled into the Idera product line as Idera Server Backup 5.0. This restructuring was accompanied by a new "pay-as-you-go" pricing model.

The company formally changed its name to Idera, Inc. in January 2012.

Idera was acquired by private equity firm TA Associates in September 2014.

On October 7, 2015, Idera announced an agreement to acquire Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.

On May 31, 2017, HGGC bought a controlling stake.

On May 23, 2019, Partners Group made an investment in Idera.

In 2022, Yellowfin, a business intelligence and analytics software provider, was acquired by Idera. This acquisition aims to enhance Idera’s portfolio by integrating Yellowfin’s analytics capabilities.
