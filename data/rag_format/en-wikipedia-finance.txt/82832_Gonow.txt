**Gonow** (officially **Zhejiang Gonow Auto Co., Ltd.**) (Chinese: 浙江吉奥汽车有限公司) is a Chinese manufacturer of automobiles, commercial vehicles and SUV's headquartered in Taizhou, Zhejiang and a subsidiary of GAC Group. It markets its products under the brand name *GAC Gonow* in China and as *Gonow* in other markets.


## History

The company was founded on 27 September 2003 with headquarters in Taizhou, Zhejiang. The campus covers an area of 268,000 m². Production began with the Gonow AGE, with an initial phase of 60,000 units produced. Gonow spent 351.5 million RMB expanding its grounds by 100 acres, and increasing production to 200,000 units per year. They also began cooperation with Wuhan University of Technology, taking over construction of the **Gonow Automobile R&D Center**.

In 2006, Gonow entered the European Union market, in a joint venture with the Italian company **DR Motor Company SpA**. Two SUV models were produced under license, and were marketed under the brand name **Katay Gonow**.

On 24 October 2010, Gonow was the first Chinese car to score points in a FIA world championship, with its Italian Team Sonia Ielo – Francesca Olivoni taking 8th place in the Ecorally San Marino – Vatican City of the FIA Alternative Energies Cup.

In 2010, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (GAC) bought 51% of Gonow. Gonow announced in March 2015 that the company will start concentrating on constructing Trumpchi vehicles, raising anger from its dealers since the unsold Gonow vehicles and spare parts were mortgaged by various banks.

In 2015, GAC Group announced that Gonow will be integrated into the company as a subsidiary. It's been reported that the 49% stake of Gonow will be purchased and will halt further production/sales in 2016 due to problems in committing to aftermarket sales and production/delivery of its vehicles to Gonow dealers.
