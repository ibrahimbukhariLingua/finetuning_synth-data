## History

The concept for VitaPerk's powdered coffee supplement began in January 2010 as an attempted convergence of the coffee and nutritional supplement industries.

During the summer of 2015, Brad Kifferstein appeared on CNBC's *Power Pitch*, where his pitch received one "in" and two "out" votes from the panelists.
