## History

Atlys was founded in 2021 by Mohak Nahta, a former Pinterest engineer. That same year, the company raised $1 million in a pre-seed round led by South Park Commons (SPC), providing initial capital for the development of its visa application platform. The initial version of the platform allowed users to complete visa applications for Turkey and later expanded to support applications for more countries.

Later that year, Atlys secured $4.25 million in a seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with additional investments from South Park Commons, Weekend Fund, and angel investors, including Pinterest co-founders Ben Silbermann and Evan Sharp. In 2023, Atlys raised $12 million in a Series A round co-led by Peak XV Partners (Sequoia Capital) and Elevation Capital. The company has also extended its services to smaller cities in India.

In 2023, Atlys acquired Artionis (UK) Limited, a company specializing in visa processing and citizen services in Europe. This was followed in 2024 by a $20 million Series B round, co-led by Peak XV Partners and Elevation Capital, with participation from DST Global and Headline.
