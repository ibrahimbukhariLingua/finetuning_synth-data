## Environmental concerns

During its early years, cement production grew from 1.2 million tons to 25 million tons. This made the Bamburi quarries inhospitable arid wasteland with brackish water. In 1959, the company engaged Rene Haller to beautify the area. In the 1971 Haller embarked on the reforestation project leading to the formation of Haller Park. The park is tourist attraction with a wide range of flora and fauna.

The company has since aimed to convert barren landscape of disused limestone quarries into vibrant and diverse ecosystem of forest, grasslands and ponds.
