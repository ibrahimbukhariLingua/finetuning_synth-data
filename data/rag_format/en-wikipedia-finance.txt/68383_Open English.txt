## History

Open English was founded in 2006 in Caracas, Venezuela, by Andrés Moreno, Nicolette Rankin, and Wilmer Sarmiento.

The founders recognized the limitations of conventional English language education and the potential of online learning. After initial struggles, the company began to expand, securing venture capital funding. In 2009, Open English moved its headquarters to Miami, Florida, and has since expanded across Latin America, the U.S. Hispanic market, Europe, Middle East, and Asia. The COVID-19 pandemic marked a significant surge in demand for online learning, contributing to Open English's growth.

Open English reported revenues of US$77 million in 2020. The company was valued at approximately US$350 million as of 2019. It enrolled more than 150,000 new students in the first half of 2021, bringing the total number of students to over 2 million. Open English has also secured corporate partnerships with more than 2,000 enterprise clients and has a global network of over 2,000 native English-speaking teachers.

Open English has engaged in various social impact initiatives. Notably, in 2023, the company partnered with Brazilian soccer player Richarlison to donate $400,000 worth of English courses to underprivileged youth in Brazil. Additionally, Open English has donated over $170,000 in scholarships to the AlumnUSB association, supporting students in Venezuela.

The company also presented a confidential initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. The recent acquisitions, including that of English Ninjas, mark a strategic move to expand into Europe, Middle East, and Asia, where it is planning to enter the Vietnamese market with its English courses for businesses.
