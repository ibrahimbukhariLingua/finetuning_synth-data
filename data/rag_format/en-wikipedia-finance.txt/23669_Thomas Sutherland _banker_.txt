In 1863, he became the first chairman of the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock. In order to help finance the burgeoning trade between China and Europe, and explore the potential for China—United States trade, Sutherland established The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865 and became its first vice-chairman.
