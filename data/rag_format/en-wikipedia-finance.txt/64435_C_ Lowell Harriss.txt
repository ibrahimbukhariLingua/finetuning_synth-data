**Clement Lowell Harriss** (1912–2009) was an American economist, a past president of the National Tax Association and a former executive director of the Academy of Political Science. He was one of the United States' leading tax experts and the author of highly regarded economics textbooks and other books on economic subjects. He was professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University and taught there for 43 years. He was the professor for whom the C. Lowell Harriss Professorship of Economics and International Affairs at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia was named.


## Early life

Harriss was born in Fairbury, Nebraska. He was the son of Riley Clement Harriss and Alice Mary Hunt. He was a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard. Upon graduating from Harvard, he was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship which funded his travel for 13 months throughout Europe, Turkey, the Balkans, and Northern Africa. He arrived in Berlin the day Hitler began his presidency. He also undertook graduate study at the University of Chicago and earned a Ph.D. from Columbia University.


## Teaching career

In addition to his long affiliation with Columbia University, Harriss taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton University, and Yale. He also held posts at the Wharton School, the New School for Social Research and Pace University. He accepted the posthumous 1996 Nobel Prize in Economics for his colleague at Columbia, William Vickrey, because the announcement of the prize occurred just three days before Vickrey died. Vickrey had been awarded the prize along with James Mirrlees for research on the economic theory of incentives.
