# Groupe Artémis



**Groupe Artémis** is a French investment holding with a portfolio in fashion (Kering), wine (Artémis Domaines including Château Latour), art (Christie's, Pinault Collection), sports (Stade Rennais FC) and entertainment (Creative Artists Agency). Headquartered in Paris, France, Groupe Artémis was founded by François Pinault in 1992.


## History

In 1992, the French entrepreneur François Pinault transferred his majority stake in Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR, renamed Kering in 2013) to his new company, Groupe Artémis, created as a family investment vehicle. Throughout the 1990s, he engaged in a series of prestigious acquisitions.

The acquisition of Château Latour (Pauillac-Médoc) in 1993 was the first of a series under the Artémis Domaines [fr] label. Artémis Domaines was restructured in 2022 after the acquisition of Bouchard Père et Fils.

Groupe Artémis bought the news magazine *Le Point* in 1997, the auction house Christie's and the Ligue 1 soccer team Stade Rennais FC in 1998, and the book-publishing company Éditions Tallandier [fr] in 1999.

In May 2003, François-Henri Pinault took over the presidency of Artémis.

In 2005, Groupe Artémis acquired the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, which reopened in 2006 as the first exhibition site of Pinault Collection. Pinault Collection inaugurated the Punta della Dogana in Venice in 2009 and the Bourse de Commerce in Paris in 2021.

Artémis acquired 40.9% of Courrèges in 2014 (100% in 2018) and the luxury cruise operator Ponant in 2015. In 2017, the group launched the tech investment company Red River West and acquired the couture house Giambattista Valli. In 2018, Artémis acquired the magazine *Point de vue [fr]* (royal family news).

In 2019, the Pinault family, through Artémis, pledged to donate 100 million euros for the reconstruction of Notre-Dame de Paris after the fire. In 2023, Artémis acquired a majority stake in the talent and sports agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA) for an estimated $7 billion, "a deal that shows the ever-growing convergence of fashion and fame" according to *The New York Times*.
