## Business and operations


### Short Distance

Blade's Short Distance business allows passengers to book seats directly from the Blade mobile app on flights operating between Blade terminals in New York, Vancouver and Southern Europe. Flights are typically between 10 and 100 miles in length and are primarily serviced on helicopters and amphibious seaplanes. Short Distance flights are also available on a full aircraft charter basis. Flights can also be crowdsourced at customer-selected times, where empty seats are sold to other flyers.

Blade's Short Distance business operates in markets with significant population density, where the primary competition is ground or ferry transportation. In 2022, Blade's Short Distance business generated $45 million in revenue.

Blade's first Short Distance route was launched in 2014, offering passenger service between Manhattan, Southampton, East Hampton, and Montauk. In March 2019, Blade launched BLADE Airport, which offers continuous service for passengers traveling between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport. BLADE Airport service was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, but was relaunched in June 2021 for passengers traveling between Manhattan and JFK Airport. In November 2021, Blade launched an additional BLADE Airport route for passengers traveling between Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport.

In December 2021, Blade entered the Vancouver market with the acquisition of the exclusive rights to Helijet's scheduled passenger business. At the time of the acquisition, Helijet was operating at an annualized revenue run-rate that was about 50% of its pre-COVID-19 level of US$15 million. In September 2022 Blade completed the acquisitions of the commercial passenger transport activities of three urban air mobility operators: Monacair SAM, Héli Sécurité, and Azur Hélicoptère.

### MediMobility Organ Transport

In 2021 Blade's MediMobility Organ Transport business, acquired Trinity Air Medical, becoming the largest dedicated air transporter of human organs for transplant in the United States. The division provides hospitals and organ procurement organizations with an end-to-end multi-modal solution incorporating rotorcraft, fixed-wing aircraft, and ground vehicles. Blade MediMobility missions utilize the same aircraft that service passenger flights, with demand typically occurring at night, complementing consumer demand during the day. Blade believes organ transport represents a clear use case for future drone or EVA adoption, particularly given necessary infrastructure and landing zones are already in place at many hospitals. In 2022, Blade's Short Distance business generated $71.8 million in revenue.


### Business model

Blade utilizes an asset-light business model in which the company does not own nor operate aircraft, but rather partners with a vast network of aircraft operators who are vetted for safety, operational excellence and financial wherewithal. Blade's business model was designed to be scalable and profitable using conventional aircraft, while providing the foundation to enable a seamless transition to electric vertical aircraft (EVA or eVTOL) in the future. Electric vertical aircraft are expected to offer reduced noise, zero emissions, and lower operating costs relative to conventional aircraft.

In April 2023, Blade's CEO, Robert Wiesenthal, said "the goal of Blade was to create the entire ecosystem required for EVAs outside of the manufacturing of the aircraft, the operating of the aircraft, and the maintenance of that aircraft". Instead, Blade primarily focuses on terminal infrastructure, technology, and brand recognition.


## History


### 2014–2016

Blade was founded by Robert S. Wiesenthal and launched on Memorial Day (May 26) of 2014, with service between Manhattan, Southampton, East Hampton, and Montauk.

Over the 2014 Fourth of July weekend, Blade partnered with Uber to power UberChopper, a service that allowed Uber users to book a helicopter through their mobile application to The Hamptons.

In December 2015, Blade expanded its offerings and launched BLADEone, a seasonal by-the-seat jet service between Manhattan and Miami or Manhattan and Aspen. The inaugural flight took place on December 3 in conjunction with Art Basel.

In September 2015 during the UN General Assembly and Pope Francis's visit to NYC in 2015, Blade offered a 6 minute cross town shuttle departing every 15 minutes.

### 2020–present

In 2020 in partnership with Andrew Saffir, creator of The Cinema Society, Blade hosted a socially distanced, drive-in premier of Disney+'s *Artemis Fowl* in June 2020.

In November 2020, Blade became the first aviation company to require pre-boarding coronavirus testing for flights within the United States. The tests were distributed by CrowdRX, a division of Global Medical Response.

On May 10, 2021, Blade became the first publicly traded urban air mobility company. In listing the company it changed its name from Blade Urban Air Mobility to Blade Air Mobility. The stock offering was handled through the SPAC merger of Experience Investment Corp. (sponsored by KSL Capital Partners) with BLADE Urban Air Mobility, Inc. The new company became BLADE Air Mobility. BLADE Urban Air became a wholly-owned subsidiary.

## Opposition

There has been pushback within The Hamptons community against increased air traffic at the local East Hampton Airport. Opponents claim that noise levels have increased as a direct result of increased air traffic.

East Hampton Airport has long been owned and operated by the local municipality. This has caused a significant rift in the community, as politicians and residents fight over whether to accept Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funds or not. Recently, the Town of East Hampton reached an agreement with the FAA to self-fund the airport, allowing them to impose stricter rules on air traffic.

On April 16, 2015, The Town of East Hampton voted to adopt strict laws limiting air traffic in and out of the East Hampton Airport. Beginning summer of 2015, there was a ban on all flights from 11:00PM to 7:00AM. Any aircraft that fell under the Town's classification of "noisy"—aircraft with an Effective Perceived Noise in Decibels (EPNdB) approach level of 91.0 or greater—was forbidden from taking off or landing from 8:00PM to 9:00AM all year and was limited to one landing and one takeoff per week. There is currently a lawsuit against the FAA for its part in waiving grant assurances that allowed the Town to enact these rules.

In September 2023, six protestors with the group Extinction Rebellion were arrested outside the W. 30th Street Heliport. The protestors targeted Blade and other operators for producing an outsize share of "luxury emissions".


## Incidents

On May 15, 2019, a Bell 206 helicopter operated by Zip Aviation made an emergency landing on floats on the water near the W. 30th Street Heliport in New York City. There were no passengers on board. The pilot was uninjured and immediately exited the aircraft after landing. At the time of the incident, the helicopter was being repositioned for fueling by the operator and was not flying for Blade.
