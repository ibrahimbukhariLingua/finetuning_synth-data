Cem Uzan


# Cem Uzan



**Cem Uzan** (born 26 December 1960, Istanbul) is a Turkish businessman and politician involved in the media and banking industries, while also chairing the social liberal Young Party (GP). His family's media empire (Uzan Group) at one time included both television stations and print media. His family was one of Turkey's most influential families. His supporters claim Uzan's political rivalry resulted in the group's companies being seized by the government under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, eventually resulting in Uzan's flight to France to escape what he claimed was political persecution. He has been sentenced *in absentia* to jail terms in the UK, USA and Turkey for fraud-related offences.

Uzan attempted to buy three units of Trump World Tower, but he ultimately defaulted on the contract and lost an $8 million deposit.

Cem Uzan announced his intention to run for president in 2023 Turkish presidential election.


## Criticism

Uzan has often been criticized for using his professional life to bolster his political life, and even benefiting from criminal charges leveled against him. In 2003, U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff commented, "I think the proof is very strong that the Uzans are business imperialists of the worst kind, in that they will go to any lengths, including fraud and racketeering, to preserve their business empire..." Cem Uzan responded by asserting that the judge "is biased against Turkey, against the Turkish people."


## Fraud and convictions

In December 2002, a U.K. court sentenced Cem Uzan to 15 months imprisonment for contempt of court after he failed to appear in the U.K. to testify in a case involving a $4.3billion defrauding of Motorola corporation.

In 2009, Motorola and Nokia won a $4.8 billion judgement against the Uzan family. The Uzans failed to show up in court and the judge ordered an arrest warrant for them should they enter the United States. In 2009, he fled to France claiming political asylum. The request was granted by the French government. He was later indicted of racketeering in Turkey.

After his flight to France, Uzan was sentenced in absentia in Turkey to twenty-three years in prison on 15 April 2010.
