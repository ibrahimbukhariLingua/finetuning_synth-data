## History

In 1987, Susanne and Christoph Botschen opened the "Theresa" boutique in Munich city center, where they sold designer fashion for women. In 2006, the couple supplemented the physical store by founding an online store, Mytheresa, which offers ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories, and fine jewelry from more than 250 designers.

Mytheresa expanded its offering to include kidswear in 2019, menswear in 2020.

In May 2020, after Neiman Marcus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Mytheresa was carved out of the bankruptcy estate by financial investors and temporarily financed via shareholder loans of USD 200 million. In January 2021, the immediate parent company, MYT Netherlands, was listed on the NYSE, resulting in USD 407 million in issue proceeds, which were used to repay the shareholder loans. The remainder of the proceeds was used to finance the company's strong growth.

In 2022, Mytheresa expanded its luxury offering to include home décor and lifestyle products with the introduction of the “Life” category. In 2023, the range was supplemented with Certified Pre-Owned watches in collaboration with Bucherer, and the Fine Jewelry category was further expanded. In autumn 2023, Mytheresa opened a new 55,000 m² distribution center at Halle/Leipzig Airport.

In October 2024, it was announced that Mytheresa would acquire Richemont's online luxury fashion and accessories business Yoox Net-A-Porter (YNAP), subject to regulatory approval, in exchange for Richemont acquiring a 33% equity stake in Mytheresa.
