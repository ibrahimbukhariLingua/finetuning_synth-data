## History

Tilney was founded in 1836 in Liverpool as a company for dealing in stocks and shares. It remained an independent business for 150 years, until it was acquired by Charterhouse Group (then owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland). In 2005, it was bought out by management in a deal backed by private equity investor Bridgepoint Capital, and in 2007 it was bought by Deutsche Bank. In 2014 it was merged with Bestinvest with the backing of investment group Permira.

Smith & Williamson was founded in 1881 in Glasgow, by David Johnstone Smith and Andrew Williamson. Over the years, the firm grew through a series of mergers and acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Belfast-based investment management firm Cunningham Coates in 2001 and accountancy firm Solomon Hare in 2005.ᵇᵉᵗᵗᵉʳˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
