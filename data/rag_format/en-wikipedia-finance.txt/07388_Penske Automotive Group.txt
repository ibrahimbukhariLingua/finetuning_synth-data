## History

Penske Automotive was founded as United Automotive Group in 1990 by Marshall S. Cogan and later came under the control of Penske Corporation and Roger Penske in May 1999. Several years later, on July 2, 2007, United Automotive Group changed its corporate name to Penske Automotive Group, Inc; and changed its ticker symbol on the NYSE to PAG.

In February 2009, General Motors declared its intent to part with the Saturn brand by closing or selling the division, either to investors or to dealers, as part of restructuring plans dependent upon the receipt of a second round of government loans ("bailout" funding). In June 2009, it was announced with much fanfare that Penske Automotive Group would purchase Saturn and its assets from General Motors. Less than four months later, on September 30, the deal collapsed as Penske announced it would terminate the deal with GM blaming manufacturing uncertainties with certain models.
