## History

Voxbone was founded in Brussels, Belgium, in 2005 by Rodrigue Ullens and Francois Struman as Voxbone SA/NV. As a consultant for telecom operators, Ullens noticed the growing demand for phone numbers from other countries and decided to create the business. The founders’ mission was to offer simplified access to telephony resources through the cloud.

In 2011, the company launched a “global capacity-sharing model” to tackle the complex tasks and costs associated with planning and managing global voice traffic. Customers are charged according to their peak simultaneous sessions globally (vs. total minute usage per country, or geographical origin of calls, in traditional models).

In August 2015 Vitruvian Partners LLP (“Vitruvian”), a leading independent European private equity firm, announced that it had acquired a majority stake in Voxbone SA.

In March 2019 Voxbone announced the launch of its enterprise platform. Built for business end users, the platform provides voice and messaging in 65 countries.

On October 12, 2020 Voxbone announced its acquisition by Bandwidth for €446 million EUR. On November 2, 2020, it was announced that the deal had been finalized.
