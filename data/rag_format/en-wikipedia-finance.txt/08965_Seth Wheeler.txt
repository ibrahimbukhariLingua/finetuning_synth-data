## Response to Housing Crisis

Wheeler came onto the Treasury Department in 2007 to help with the financial crisis and stayed on for two and a half years. His main accomplishment was contributing to the Home Affordable Modification Program. The purpose of this program was to ease the impact of the foreclosure of homes of millions of homeowners by providing refinancing options. The program ran into implementation issues related to the operational details of refinancing, though it did help refinance the mortgages of more than 200 thousand homeowners. He is said to have left the public sector for personal reasons.
