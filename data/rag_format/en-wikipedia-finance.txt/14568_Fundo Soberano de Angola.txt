# Fundo Soberano de Angola



The **Fundo Soberano de Angola** (lit. 'Angola Sovereign [Wealth] Fund', **FSDEA**) is the sovereign wealth fund of Angola. It is a member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds, and therefore has signed up to the Santiago Principles on best practice in managing sovereign wealth funds. The FSDEA is meant to play an important role in promoting Angola’s social and economic development and generating wealth for its people. The fund was rated by the SWFI in February 2015 with a ranking of 8 out of 10.


## History

On November 20, 2008, Angola’s President, José Eduardo dos Santos, announced to establish a special commission to build the foundations for a new sovereign wealth fund "to promote growth, prosperity and social and economic development across Angola". In 2011, the fund was ratified and established as "Fundo Soberano de Angola". It replaced the former *Fundo Petrolífero de Angola* (Oil for Infrastructure Fund). At inception it was the second largest investment fund in Sub-Saharan Africa after Botswana's Pula Fund, having had an initial capital of US$5 billion. It is also envisaged that it will receive supplementary funding each year equivalent to the sales value of 100,000 barrels of oil per day (5.6% of the total daily petroleum output). The value of this volume may be about US$3.5 billion every year.

On January 12, 2018, João Lourenço, the current president of the Republic, elects the new administration of the Sovereign Fund of Angola, asking them to recover the "important role" of the institution in the country's economy, in order to guarantee "a more efficient and transparent use of the state's strategic resources ". In December 2024, the fund has US$ 3.9 billion in assets under management.


## Corporate Governance

The fund has pledged its adherence to the Santiago Principles and will aim to be rated on the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2014. It will also be subject to an annual performance assessment by the Angolan Parliament. In November 2013, Deloitte was appointed as the independent external auditor.

Based on an investment policy that was approved in June 2013, the FSDEA aims to generate wealth for future generations and support Angola’s social and economic development. The FSDEA was also recognized as a transparent SWF sovereign wealth fund by the SWFI (Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute) in February 2015 with a ranking of 8 out of 10, which is a significant milestone for the fund. Fundo Soberano de Angola is committed to operate transparently, responsibly and in full compliance with the laws and regulations of Angola and the countries where it will make future investments.
