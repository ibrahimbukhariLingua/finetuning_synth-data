**Bolt Financial Inc.** (**Bolt**) is an American financial technology start-up that provides merchants with software to facilitate one-click online checkouts. It was founded in 2014 in San Francisco.


## History

Bolt was founded by Stanford University computer science students Ryan Breslow and Eric Feldman in 2014. Their goal was to simplify online checkout for consumers and help independent retailers compete with Amazon, which held the patent on one-click checkout until 2017. The company initially operated out of Breslow's dorm room.

In 2021, the company entered into partnerships with its first European clients and acquired Tipser, a technology company based in Sweden. In December 2021, it raised $393 million, bringing Bolt's lifetime raise to almost $1bn. Its valuation was $11bn as of January 2022.

In February 2022, Bolt CTO and CPO Maju Kuruvilla, previously VP and general manager of worldwide logistics and fulfillment at Amazon, was named CEO.

As of February 2024, Bolt had under 700 employees, and was value at approximately $300 million - a 97% decrease in price from 21 months prior.
