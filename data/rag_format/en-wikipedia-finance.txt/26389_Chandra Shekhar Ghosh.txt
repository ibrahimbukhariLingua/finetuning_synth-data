## Early life and education

Ghosh's father, Late Haripada Ghosh, owned a sweet shop in Tripura. Even as a student, Ghosh supported his father at the shop. After completing his education, he joined BRAC, Bangladesh’s largest non-government organisation (NGO). After returning to India, Ghosh worked with several NGOs, before quitting his last job at the Village Welfare Society. He then established Bandhan-Konnagar, a not-for-profit organisation in West Bengal, which aimed to provide microfinance services to the marginalised, thereby driving financial inclusion.

Ghosh holds a Master’s degree in Statistics.


## Career

Ghosh started Bandhan-Konnagar in 2001. The NGO extended micro-credit to marginalised women to help them become entrepreneurs. In 2009, the microfinance portfolio of the NGO was transferred to the NBFC, which Bandhan had acquired in 2006. Gradually, the organisation expanded its operations to various states of the country. In 2010, Bandhan became the largest microfinance institution in India.

In 2014, Bandhan received an in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank of India to set up a universal bank. The final licence was obtained in June 2015. Bandhan Bank started operations on August 23, 2015, with Ghosh as the MD & CEO where he served till 9 July 2024. This is the first-ever instance of an Indian microfinance institution becoming a universal bank. Incidentally, Bandhan Bank is also the first bank to be set up in Eastern India since Independence.

Besides being the former Chairman of The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Eastern Region, and the former President of Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry (BCC&I), he is also associated with various other industry bodies.
