# B. R. Shetty



**Dr Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty**, (born 1 August 1942) commonly known as **B.R. Shetty**, is an Indian-born businessman and former billionaire, the founder and acquirer of a number of companies based in the United Arab Emirates, including Abu Dhabi–based NMC Health, Neopharma, BRS Ventures, and Finablr.
