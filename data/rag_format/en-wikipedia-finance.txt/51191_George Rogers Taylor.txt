## Biography

Taylor was born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. He was the son of Webb Vine Taylor and Grace Rogers. He received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago. He graduated in 1914 from Wayland Academy at Beaver Dam and from what was then Oshkosh Normal School in 1916. He earned his way through college by waiting on tables, mowing lawns and tending furnaces. After his graduation from Oshkosh Normal School, he served a year as principal of a small elementary school at Waukesha and then enlisted for two years in the U.S. Navy during World War I. He taught for two years at Wayland Academy and then received his bachelor's degree 1921 and his doctorate in 1929, both from the University of Chicago.

He was a member of the faculty at Amherst College from 1924 to 1965 where he helped to develop the college's American Studies Program. From 1948 to 1968, he was the general editor of the program's book series called “Problems in American Civilization." The books were used nationally in colleges and secondary schools for many years. Taylor was the special editor of the series volumes on these subjects: the Turner thesis describing the role of the frontier in American history; “Jackson vs Biddle” the struggle over the Second Bank of the United States; “Hamilton and the National Debt"; and “The Great Tariff Debate 1820 to 1830.” His 1951 book *The Transportation Revolution, 1815–1860* remains a key text in the analysis of the development of capitalism in the early republic.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.
