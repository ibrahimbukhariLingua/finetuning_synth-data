**Downtown Music Holdings** is an independent rights management and music services company based in the US State of New York. It comprises 10 businesses. All divisions live under the Downtown Music Holdings umbrella and are split between two verticals, Creator and Business (Downtown Music).


## History

Downtown was founded as Downtown Music Publishing in 2007 by Justin Kalifowitz in New York. The business model was developed to address the consolidation of the music publishing industry as well as the new technologies which impacted songwriters and copyright holders. Downtown Music Studios opened in 2008. In 2011, Downtown formally launched Songtrust as a business unit, extending the company's royalty collection platform capabilities beyond the parent publishing company. Neighboring Rights was established in 2016.

Until January 2013, Downtown was the owner of the record label Downtown Records.

In 2013, Downtown expanded its offices to Los Angeles. In early 2014, the company expanded to Nashville and later that year founded Downtown Music Benelux. Based in Amsterdam, Downtown Music Benelux was established in collaboration with Hot Streak Music, a division of Cloud 9 Music. In 2015, following the acquisition of the London-based music publisher Eagle-i Music, Downtown UK was founded.

In March 2019, Downtown acquired AVL Digital Group for $200 million. AVL became the owner of CD Baby, Soundrop, AdRev, and DashGo.

In August 2021, founder Justin Kalifowitz stepped down as CEO and became the company's executive chairman.

Universal Music announced its intent to acquire the company in December 2024, which is set to close in mid 2025. Once the acquisition is complete the company would be placed under Virgin Music Group.
