# Lakeshore Entertainment



**Lakeshore Village Entertainment** is an American independent film production, finance, and former international sales and distribution company founded in 1994 by Tom Rosenberg and Ted Tannebaum. Lakeshore Entertainment is headquartered in Beverly Hills, California.

The company produced over 60 films, including the Academy Award-winning *Million Dollar Baby* (2004). Sigurjón Sighvatsson was the company's first president and served from its founding until 1998. He was replaced by producer Gary Lucchesi.

In 2013, Lakeshore launched a television division, and in 2015, they launched a digital studio, Off the Dock, that targets the YouTube demographic. The company also had a record label division, Lakeshore Records.

In March 2019, Lakeshore placed its film library up for sale. The library includes 300 titles, such as the New World Pictures library (which Lakeshore acquired in 1996). In October 2019, Lakeshore sold its library and international operation to Vine Alternative Investments for roughly $200 million. In July 2024, Vine Alternative Investments sold their portfolio (excluding Village Roadshow Entertainment Group and EuropaCorp) to Shamrock Capital.

## Lakeshore Records

**Lakeshore Records** is a soundtrack record label, originally founded as the independent music division of Lakeshore Entertainment. It had begun as Will Records, which was founded by Skip Williamson in the early 1990s.

As Will Records they released albums by artists such as Grandaddy (starting with their debut *A Pretty Mess by This One Band*). In 2000, Will Records acquired the catalogue of recently closed Loosegroove Records (a catalogue that included the debut full-length album by Queens of the Stone Age).

Will Records and Lakeshore Entertainment partnered to form Lakeshore Records. In 2011, it signed a home video deal with Image Entertainment.

In February 2020, it was announced that Lakeshore Records had been sold to Cutting Edge Group.
