## History

Founded by Frank Russell in 1936 in Tacoma, Washington, Russell Investments began as a stockbroker and consultant, and later created the Russell 2000 Index, one of the most followed stock market indices in the U.S. His grandson, George Russell, has been credited with expanding the company and pioneering the business of pension consulting when he secured J. C. Penney as the first pension client.

Northwestern Mutual acquired Russell Investments during 1998–1999 for $1.2 billion. The company's headquarters were relocated to Seattle in 2009.

In 2014, London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) acquired the firm for $2.7 billion. Russell Investments had approximately $256 billion in assets under management at the time. LSEG separated the Russell Indexes from other Frank Russell group companies doing business as Russell Investments, such as asset management and consulting, opting to retain the former and sell the latter. LSEG announced the FTSE Russell brand in May 2015.

During 2015–2016, the company was valued at $1.15 billion and purchased by TA Associates, a Boston-based private equity firm, from LSEG. TA hired Goldman Sachs in 2019 to assess Russell Investments' possible sale.
