## History

Boomtown, Inc. opened its **Boomtown Westbank** casino on August 6, 1994.

The property became part of Hollywood Park, Inc. (later Pinnacle Entertainment) with its purchase in 1997 of Boomtown, Inc.

In 2006, Pinnacle approved a major expansion for Boomtown New Orleans, expected to cost $145 million, including a 200-room, four-star hotel with a spa and salon, an expansion of the Boomers nightclub, an Asian restaurant, additional meeting space, a new employee dining area, and an expansion of the buffet. The expansion was supposed to start in the first quarter of 2007 and be finished by the second quarter of 2008.

A renewed expansion plan was announced in 2012, including a $20-million, 150-room hotel, fitness center, meeting rooms, and 250 new parking spaces. The hotel opened on January 21, 2015.

In 2016, the property was sold to Gaming and Leisure Properties along with almost all of Pinnacle's real estate assets, and leased back to Pinnacle. Penn National Gaming (now Penn Entertainment) acquired Boomtown's operations in 2018, as part of the acquisition of Pinnacle.
