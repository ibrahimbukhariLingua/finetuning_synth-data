## History

Ren√© Lacerte, who co-founded and led an online payroll software startup PayCycle, stepped down as its CEO in November 2004 per the decision of the Board. Lacerte soon started working on his next company, which eventually became Bill.com. Founded in April 2006 as Cashboard, Inc., the company enables small businesses to pay their bills and keep their books in the cloud. Its early investors included August Capital and DCM Ventures.

In October 2019, Bill.com started offering new capabilities to help mid-market companies automate their AP/AR functions.

Bill.com completed its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2019. In early 2020, Bill.com moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to San Jose, California.

In June 2021, Bill.com acquired Divvy for $2.5 billion, an expense management company that modernizes business finances by combining software and corporate smart cards into a single platform. Later that September, the company closed the acquisition of Invoice2go for $625 million, an AR mobile-first company, extending the company's reach to serve sole proprietors.
