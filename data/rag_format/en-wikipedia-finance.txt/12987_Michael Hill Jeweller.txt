# Michael Hill Jeweller



**Michael Hill International Ltd.** is a speciality retailer of jewellery. As of June 2024, it operates 300 stores in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The company employs approximately 2,600 permanent employees. Its headquarters are in Brisbane, Australia.


## History

The company started in 1979, when Michael Hill and his wife, Christine, opened their first store in the New Zealand town of Whangārei. A unique retail jewellery formula that included dramatically different store designs, a product range devoted exclusively to jewellery and almost saturation levels of high impact advertising elevated the company to national prominence.

The company expanded to 10 stores by 1987, the same year it listed on the NZX. Also in this year, Michael Hill Jeweller expanded into Australia, opening four stores.

In 2000, Michael Hill Jeweller had 40 stores in New Zealand, including 12 in Auckland.

In 2002, the company expanded into Canada, opening its first stores in Vancouver, British Columbia. Michael Hill now has a presence in five Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. In September 2008, the company entered the United States market by acquiring 17 stores in Illinois and Missouri from Whitehall Jewelers. By mid-2013 over 60% of overall sales were from Australia, only 20% from New Zealand, with the rest from North America.

Emma Hill, the daughter of Michael Hill, succeeded him as chairperson after the November 2015 annual general meeting.

In April 2018, Michael Hill closed their nine remaining stores in the US.

In April 2023, Michael Hill announced it would acquire Australian jewellery chain Bevilles and its 26 stores for A$45 million.


## Michael Hill watches

In late 2006, following a five-year trial, the company launched its own brand of watches under the Michael Hill name, phasing out all but the Citizen brand of watches by the middle of 2007. By mid-2008, only Michael Hill-brand watches were available in the company's stores.
