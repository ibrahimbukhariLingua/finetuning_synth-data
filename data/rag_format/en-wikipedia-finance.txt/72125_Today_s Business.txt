# Today's Business



***Today's Business*** is an American business news television program that aired on CNBC in the early morning, 5–7 am ET timeslot, hosted for the end of its run by Liz Claman and Bob Sellers. In January 2002, New York Post mentions producers are taking away this programme with expanded hour. Finally, it was replaced by *Wake Up Call* on Feb 4, 2002.

## CNBC Europe edition

A business news television program also titled *Today's Business* aired on CNBC Europe from 6–7 am CET (5–6 am WET) between January 2001 and March 2007. It was originally based on the CNBC U.S. morning version of *Today's Business*.

The European *Today's Business* was presented by Steve Sedgwick from 2006 through the end of the program's run in 2007. Earlier presenters of the program were Simon Hobbs (2001–2003), Serena Al-Awa (2003), and Guy Johnson (2003–2006). The executive producer of morning programming is Harry Fuller.

Segments on the program included a review of the previous day's business, a news headlines round-up, as well as early results from the market. The program also linked up with CNBC Asia for continuing coverage of the Asian session.

The program was renamed from *Today's Business Europe* in May 2003. While the title was only slightly altered, the program was reduced from two hours to one (with the then-titled CNBC *Europe Squawk Box* gaining an hour). While *Today's Business Europe* had been presented in front of CNBC Europe's video wall, the new program, initially co-anchored by Guy Johnson and Serena Al-Awa, was presented from behind a desk.

The program ended its run on March 23, 2007 and was replaced on March 26, 2007 by a new show, *Capital Connection*, co-anchored by Maura Fogarty at CNBC Asia in Singapore and Sedgwick in London.
