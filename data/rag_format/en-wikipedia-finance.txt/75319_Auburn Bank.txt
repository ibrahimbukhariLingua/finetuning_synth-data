## History

In 1907, Sheldon (Shel) L. Toomer, a successful businessman actively involved with community activities, established Bank of Auburn (now Auburn Bank) with his fellow merchants and faculty friends. The bank was located in the heart of downtown Auburn, which was an educational center in the early twentieth century.

In 1964, the managers decided to change the bank's name to Auburn National Bank.

In 1991, the Bank became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the “FHLB”), and in 1995, they changed the bank's name again to Auburn Bank, which is also the bank's current name.
