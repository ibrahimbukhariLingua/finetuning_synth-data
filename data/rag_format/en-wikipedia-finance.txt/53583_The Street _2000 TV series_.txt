## Reception

Dalton Ross of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the series premiere a grade of D+, stating that the "Darren Star created drama plays like a bad *Melrose Place* episode with obligatory IPO terminology thrown in". Howard Rosenberg of *Los Angeles Times* was lukewarm on the show, calling it "passable but hardly a highlight".
