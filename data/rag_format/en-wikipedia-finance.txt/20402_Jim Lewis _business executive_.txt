## Career


### Early career

In August 1984, Lewis began his first job as an accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers where he quickly developed a reputation as a top-notch and versatile professional, and was rewarded with prestigious assignments in audit, tax, and consulting. While at PWC, Lewis passed the examination to become a Certified Public Accountant. After a short period, PricewaterhouseCoopers promoted James Lewis to Senior Accountant.

In September 1986, Lewis accepted a job as Manager of Internal Audit for Tokheim Corporation, a multinational company that manufactures fluid movement and measuring devices in Fort Wayne, Indiana. At Tokheim, Lewis directed all financial and operational audits; assisted senior management in the evaluation of acquisition candidates, participated in strategic planning sessions and made numerous recommendations to management; which reduced operating costs, improved operating efficiency, and reduced outside audit fees.

In November 1988, Lewis became employed by PepsiCo in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he quickly advanced to the position of Senior Manager, Planning and Analysis. In April 1993, PepsiCo promoted Lewis to Director, Investor Relations. During his tenure as Director, the Consumer Analyst Group of New York ranked PepsiCo’s Investor Relations function number one in America.

In December 1994, PepsiCo promoted Lewis to Area Vice President of the New York, New York regions. In his capacity as Area Vice President, Lewis developed regional snack food businesses for Frito-Lay as general manager and turnaround specialist. He was responsible for the sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and warehouse functions of the Company. He directed an organization of one hundred fifty-five (155) people, including fifteen (15) direct reports. Under his leadership, the businesses experienced a 13% sales increase and a 15% profit increase. The New York region went from last place (out of 22 areas) to first place during his first year as one of the general managers. His team received the company’s Herman Lay Award for having the highest region score on combined revenue growth, profit growth, and product display execution. In late 1995 Lewis, who was demoted from Vice President, was assigned to the Houston North Zone Region as a Zone Sales Manager. He supervised 13 District Managers and over 100 route sales representatives. Due to problems created by Lewis within the first six months of his tenure, he was moved to the Frito-Lay main office in Houston until he resigned in 1996.


### Career with the Walt Disney Company

Lewis began his Disney Career in 1996 as the Director of Planning and Finance for Walt Disney Attractions. He was considered a "rising star" at the time and was a top candidate for the position of President of the Walt Disney World Resort. He was mentored by Disney executive Al Weiss during this period. Lewis progressed to become Senior Vice President, Business Development and Public Affairs for the Walt Disney World Resort. Lewis became the General Manager of the Disney Vacation Club (DVC) in November 2003; he was promoted to the position of President in 2006, making him one of the most senior African-Americans in the Disney Company. He received the Company's highest performance rating for 14 consecutive years.

During his tenure as President of the Disney Vacation Club, Lewis' division has expanded rapidly. When he took over, DVC had approximately 70,000 members in 2003; there were over 300,000 in 2006. The LA Times reported that the Disney Vacation Club's sales more than doubled from 2003 to 2007. According to Tom Staggs, then-chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, the company's timeshare revenue and operating income both doubled during Lewis' tenure. At its peak, the DVC generated over $190 million in operating income. Lewis has overseen the expansion of his division to California with the addition of time-share rooms at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and to Hawaii with the forthcoming Aulani Resort.

Lewis led DVC’s first international expansion with the development of a 15,000 square foot sales center in Tokyo, Japan. Six of DVC's 12 resorts were designed and built during Lewis' tenure, including Bay Lake Tower, Kidani Village at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge, Saratoga Springs Resort and the Treehouse Villas at Saratoga. Saratoga Springs was the company's largest vacation resort at the time.

James Lewis abruptly "parted ways" with Disney in 2011, shortly after Weiss retired. Disney allegedly fired Lewis after it became known that, for over a year, time-shares at the Aulani resort in Hawaii had been sold for fees that were less than the cost of actual taxes and maintenance. After his departure, he was replaced by Claire Bilby. However, Lewis was given a consulting role at Disney and a letter of recommendation.


### After Disney

Lewis was hired as a corporate officer at Wal-Mart in 2013, where he served as regional vice president and general manager for North Florida and Central Florida. He left the company 2015.


### Later roles

In September 2015, he was named Chief Executive Officer of the national, Florida-based company Marilyn Monroe Spas Board. He oversaw the company's expansion to India in 2017. In April 2019, he became president of Signature Products and Foods Divisions for 4-R Restaurant Group, which operates fourteen 4 Rivers Smokehouses in Florida and Georgia.


## Reception

In 2007, Lewis was named one of the ten most influential businessmen in Central Florida by the Orlando Business Journal. In 2008, The Steve Harvey Morning Show aired a piece on Lewis, honoring him as an "Influential African American" in the area of business.
