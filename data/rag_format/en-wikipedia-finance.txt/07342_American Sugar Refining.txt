# American Sugar Refining



**American Sugar Refining, Inc.** is a large privately held cane sugar refining company, with a production capacity of 6.5 million tons of sugar. The company produces a full line of consumer, industrial, food service, and specialty sweetener products. In 2013, it adopted the corporate brand name **ASR Group**. Its ownership structure is based on a partnership which includes the Florida Crystals Corporation, part of FLO-SUN, a sugar empire of the Fanjul brothers whose origins go back to Spanish-Cuban sugar plantations of the early 19th century.

Across North America, American Sugar Refining owns and operates six sugar refineries as well as specialty sweetener production facilities and a strategic warehousing and distribution system that combine to provide seamless production and delivery of its products to customers across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

American Sugar Refining, Inc. and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida acquired Domino Sugar from Tate & Lyle

American Sugar Refining also owns two of its former major competitors, the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H Sugar), purchased in 2005, and Jack Frost (National Sugar Company) in 2007. Redpath Sugar, Tate & Lyle's European sugar operations, was acquired in 2010.

American Sugar Refining's main competitor in the United States for refined cane sugar is Imperial Sugar.


## Lyle's Golden Syrup

In July 2010, American Sugar Refining purchased Lyle's Golden Syrup, a brand of golden syrup in the UK. The sale included the Plaistow Wharf and Silvertown plants.

According to a news report, the Guinness Book of Records has concluded that the design of the Lyle's Golden Syrup tin, which has remained almost unchanged since 1885, forms Britain's oldest brand.
