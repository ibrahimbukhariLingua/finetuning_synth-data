Environmental Land Management


# Environmental Land Management



Following Britain leaving the European Union, and thus no longer being a part of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU, the British government initiated the **Environmental Land Management** scheme (ELM) in 2024.


## Description

The Environmental Land Management schemes consist of three schemes to 'pay for environmental and climate goods and services':

* the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI)
* Countryside Stewardship (CS)
* Landscape Recovery

As an example of a SFI intervention. Farmers can be paid for 'Flower-rich grass margins, blocks, or in-field strips'
