Royal Society University Research Fellowship


# Royal Society University Research Fellowship



The **Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF)** is a research fellowship awarded to outstanding early career scientists in the United Kingdom who are judged by the Royal Society to have the potential to become leaders in their field. The research fellowship funds all areas of research in natural science including life sciences, physical sciences and engineering, but excluding clinical medicine.

The URF scheme provides the opportunity for fellows to build an independent career in scientific research. Fellows are expected to be strong candidates for permanent faculty posts and academic tenure in universities at the end of their fellowships. As of 2023, applicants are permitted to apply for a maximum award value of £1.83 million, over eight years. The fellowship funds up to 80% of basic salary costs for the awardee, with the other 20% usually provided by the University hosting the fellow.

Fellowships are awarded annually. In 2022, there were 28 universities across the UK and Ireland hosting 50 newly appointed University Research Fellowships. In 2015, the success rate of applications was 8%.
