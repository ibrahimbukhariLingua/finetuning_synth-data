Listed on the Paris stock exchange in 2006, the company expanded its international business with offices in Asia and Latin America in 2007.

In 2012, Thierry Gadou became chairman and CEO of the company. Connected electronic shelf labels (NFC) are installed during the same year.

In 2014, a strategic alliance is signed with imagotag GmbH (Austria) and Store Electronic Systems became SES-imagotag.

In 2015, SES-imagotag signs the largest ever contract of the electronic shelf labeling market.

In 2016, the Group signed an exclusive contract with Jysk Nordic, highlighting a rising interest from non-food retailers in the solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ provided by the Group. A trend confirmed by another deal signed with Sephora to equip the cosmetics retailer French stores.

In 2018, the company launched a digital and IoT platform operating on Microsoft's cloud, which aims to provide a better customer experience and store efficiency.

In 2024, SES-imagotag changed its name to VusionGroup.
