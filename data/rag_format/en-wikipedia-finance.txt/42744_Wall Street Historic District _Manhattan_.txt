Wall Street Historic District (Manhattan)


# Wall Street Historic District (Manhattan)



The **Wall Street Historic District** in New York City includes part of Wall Street and parts of nearby streets in the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. It includes 65 contributing buildings and one contributing structure over a 63-acre (25 ha) listed area.

The historic district's street plan originated in the colonial era. It "reflects medieval European town patterns rather than the standard grid found throughout much of Manhattan, and together with the district's towering skyscrapers it creates the narrow 'canyons' for which the area is so famous."
