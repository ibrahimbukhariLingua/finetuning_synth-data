## Candidacy for United States Senate

In 2008, Unanue was briefly a Republican primary candidate to face incumbent Frank Lautenberg in that year's U.S. Senate election. Unanue announced his candidacy after the withdrawal of moderate Republican Anne Evans Estabrook, who was initially the New Jersey GOP establishment's choice but quit the race due to a mini-stroke. Unanue was reportedly considering dropping out of the Senate race to make way for Princeton biotechnology executive John Crowley, but after Crowley signaled that he would not run, Unanue announced that he had filed petitions for the race on April 7, 2008. However, on April 11, Unanue dropped out of the race, and his committee on vacancies designated former Congressman Dick Zimmer to enter the race under the Unanue petitions.
