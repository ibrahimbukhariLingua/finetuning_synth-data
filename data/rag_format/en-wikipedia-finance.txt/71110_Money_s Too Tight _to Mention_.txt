Money's Too Tight (to Mention)


# Money's Too Tight (to Mention)



"**Money's Too Tight (to Mention)**" (sometimes stylized as "**Money$ Too Tight (to Mention)**" in some of its single and album releases) is a song written and first recorded by The Valentine Brothers, John Valentine and Billy Valentine, and released as a single in 1982. Their version peaked at number 41 on the *Billboard* R&B chart. The song was ranked at number six among the top 10 "Tracks of the Year" for 1982 by *NME*.

"Money's Too Tight (to Mention)" was covered by British pop and soul group Simply Red in 1985 as their debut single. The single went to number 13 on the UK Singles Chart in July 1985 and number 28 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart in 1986. The song was also an international hit, reaching the top 40 in several countries.

The lyrics concern a person with economic problems, and mention Reaganomics, a set of economic policies implemented by U.S. president Ronald Reagan in order to encourage the growth of the American economy. The lyrics include the lines "the old man that's over the hill", and "did the earth move for you, Nancy?" He wants to borrow money, first from his brother who responds,"Brother I'd like to help you but I'm unable to", then to his "Father, Father, almighty Father" who then responds "Money's too tight to mention".

A pastiche of the song was recorded and used as the theme song for the Australian investment television program *Money* (1993â€“2002). Another pastiche was recorded for *Bo Selecta* in segments featuring Leigh Francis's impression of Hucknall.
