# Skinner, Inc.



**Skinner** (colloquially **Skinner Auctioneers and Appraisers**) was an American auction house headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts. It has been among the world's leading auction houses for antiques and fine art.

In 2022, Skinner has been acquired by Bonhams and is currently doing business as Bonhams Skinner.


## History

Skinner was founded by dealer Robert W. Skinner Jr. (1932-1984), who believed that New England, with its long history as an international arts center, was a fitting location for a world-class auction house. The company began operations in the 1960s and was incorporated in 1971 in Bolton, Massachusetts. Skinner's Boston gallery opened in 1978. The company has seen steady growth, and in 2009, Skinner moved its headquarters to nearby Marlborough.

In March 2022, Skinner was acquired by Bonhams for an undisclosed sum. The new company will be called Bonhams Skinner.
