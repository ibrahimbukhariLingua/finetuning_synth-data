## History

Ammembal Subba Rao Pai, a philanthropist, established the *Canara Hindu Permanent Fund* in Mangalore, India, on 1 July 1906.

Canara Bank's first acquisition took place in 1961 when it acquired Bank of Kerala. This had been founded in September 1944 and at the time of its acquisition on 20 May 1961 had three branches. The second bank that Canara Bank acquired was Seasia Midland Bank (Alleppey), which had been established on 26 July 1930 and had seven branches at the time of its takeover.

In 1958, the Reserve Bank of India had ordered Canara Bank to acquire G. Raghumathmul Bank, in Hyderabad. This bank had been established in 1870, and had converted to a limited company in 1925. At the time of the acquisition G. Raghumathmul Bank had five branches. The merger took effect in 1961. Later in 1961, Canara Bank acquired Trivandrum Permanent Bank. This had been founded on 7 February 1899 and had 14 branches at the time of the merger.

Canara Bank acquired four banks in 1963: the Sree Poornathrayeesa Vilasam Bank, Thrippunithura, Arnad Bank, Tiruchirapalli, Cochin Commercial Bank, Cochin, and Pandyan Bank, Madurai.

Cochin Commercial Bank had been established on 3 January 1936, and at the time of its acquisition had 13 branches.

The Government of India nationalised Canara Bank, along with 13 other major commercial banks in India, on 19 July 1969.

## Controversies

On 6 June 2018, the UK division of Canara Bank was fined £890,000 ($1.2 million) by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority and was blocked from accepting new deposits for around five months for systematic anti-money laundering (AML) failures.

Canara Bank faced a monetary penalty of Rs 2.92 crore from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) due to non-compliance with regulations, including failures in linking interest rates of loans to external benchmarks and other operational norms. This penalty reflects the RBI's scrutiny on ensuring adherence to banking standards aimed at protecting consumer interests and maintaining financial stability. Additionally, Canara Bank was involved in a controversy where its officers were recorded abusing employees for not meeting work targets, highlighting internal management and workplace culture issues within the bank.

The Reserve Bank of India rejected Canara Bank's proposal to set up their own Credit Card Subsidiary because of the rising unsecured loan portfolios of the Canara Bank.

Canara Bank officers have been involved in instances where they were recorded verbally abusing employees for not meeting their work targets, as documented in videos that circulated on social media, prompting the bank to address these incidents publicly.

In 2024, Bhanu Srivastav, an employee noted for his expertise in Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), resigned from Canara Bank amid controversy surrounding the bank's transfer policy. His resignation drew significant attention due to his reputation as a star performer within the bank. Following his departure, there has been an observed increase in resignations, with reports suggesting that over 200 employees resign each month. This trend has been noted in discussions around employee management and transfer policies within the banking sector.
