A **management contract** is an arrangement under which operational control of an enterprise is vested by contract in a separate enterprise that performs the necessary managerial functions in return for a fee.

## Difference between management contract and franchising

In business management, franchising entails a contractual relationship between the franchisor (owner of the company) and the franchisee (purchaser of the brand name). The franchisor grants the franchisee the right to use its trademark, alongside specific business systems and processes, in exchange for a fee.

Business students usually get confused between the concepts of management contracts and franchising. Although they have much in common, (both earn by selling intangibles and both works as affiliate for another company) a management contract acts as a framework and provides formation and structure to the company and its members, and franchisees remain independent.

On hiring such companies, the owner will have more time to concentrate on the expansion of the business rather than day-to-day working of the companies. The businessperson can distribute some of their basic responsibilities to these management companies such as recruitment, deployment and retention.

Management contracts give business owners an assurance of the continuity of their business. This can be illustrated through an example. A manager or any employee may terminate their job, leaving the business a hole in its team for the smooth functioning of the operations. A contract management company can easily change few employees without stirring the constancy of the business model.

Through management contracts, a businessperson can venture into international business opportunities without taking a huge risk of putting their own physical assets at stake. For example, the Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited of Britain retains general airport management skills. In the EU, Heathrow serves the Indianapolis International Airport under a 10 years management contract. It also provides retail management at the air mall in the Pittsburgh International Airport.

The government uses management contracts for the progress and development of the skill of the local managers and workers. They also accolade management contract companies to upgrade and operate public utilities.

Entering into a management contract might lead to difficulties and problems for the business owners. By entering into such agreements, businesses tends to risk their privacy. When company management is contracted to a third party, the business owner may enter into confidential disputes. These contracts could expose the business to ethical breaches, fraud and public exposure. The information of the other contracts made by the business is also available to the management contract companies. Since their responsibilities range from price negotiation to stock control they have full information about the vendors. Management responsibilities includes record of all employees, their personal information and payments procedures. Management contract companies have information on business finance also. This puts the business in a vulnerable position.

Hiring an outside contractor makes it difficult for the business to foresee the number of conflicts that can occur. For example, a business owner hires a contract management company for the operations of the company. The management company may in turn take on the management of the supplier's company too. This can lead to several compromises in the discounts, price negotiations and suppliers way of working. There can be even more conflicts when the same management company handles the management of several competitors simultaneously.

International management can be very risky for management companies. If a country is going through political or social turmoil, the life of the Manager is put at risk to carry on with the business in such a situation.
