## History

In 2013, Lufthansa Systems AG, with around 2,700 employees worldwide, achieved annual sales of 640 million euros, of which 265 million euros came from outside the Lufthansa Group.

In March 2015, Lufthansa Systems undertook a reorganization to reform into three operating units: Infrastructure, Airline Solutions (now known as "Lufthansa Systems") and Industry Solutions (now "Lufthansa Industry Solutions"). The Infrastructure unit, which employs about 1,400 people, has been sold to IBM, while the other two units were meant to remain as subsidiaries of the parent company Lufthansa.

In November 2017, Lufthansa Systems GmbH & Co. KG began moving to a newly built headquarters in the Airport Garden business park in Raunheim, near Frankfurt Airport.
