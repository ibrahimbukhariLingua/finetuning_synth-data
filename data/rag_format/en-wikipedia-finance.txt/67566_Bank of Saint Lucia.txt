## History

After the **National Commercial Bank of St. Lucia** Limited opened its doors to the public in 1981, the **Saint Lucia Development Bank** Limited soon followed. As the names suggest the National Commercial Bank functioned as a commercial bank satisfying the personal banking needs of customers. The Saint Lucia Development Bank on the other hand was set up to provide funding in the areas of manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and fisheries.
