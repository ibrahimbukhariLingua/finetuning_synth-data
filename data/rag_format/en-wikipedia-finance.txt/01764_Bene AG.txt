## History

Bene was founded in 1790 and began industrial-scale office furniture production in 1951. During the 1980s, the company expanded internationally, opening offices in London and Moscow. In 1989, it relocated its production operations from Zell an der Ybbs to its current headquarters designed by architect Laurids Ortner in the city of Waidhofen an der Ybbs.

Between 1995 and 1998, Bene expanded its sales network into Central and Eastern Europe, establishing outlets in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 1998, the company entered the German market by acquiring Objektform. From 2000 to 2003, Bene expanded into Western Europe, opening outlets in the Benelux region and France. During this period, the Waidhofen manufacturing site was expanded from 9,000 m² to 40,000 m², supported by modernization investments totaling approximately €22 million.

In 2003, Bene formed a joint venture in Poland, Bene Nowy Styl S.A., and expanded into the Middle East with a new outlet in Dubai. In 2004, the company partnered with Japanese office furniture manufacturer KOKUYO Co., Ltd., as part of its strategy to enter the Asian market. Bene also expanded sales into Croatia and Serbia during this time.

In August 2004, a financial syndicate led by Unternehmens Invest AG (UIAG) invested in the company. Bene achieved ISO 9001 and 14001 certification in 2006 and transitioned into a joint-stock company (AG) the same year. Its initial public offering (IPO) at the Wiener Börse marked the exit of the UIAG financial syndicate. That year, Bene also expanded its network to Bulgaria, Ukraine, Spain, Ireland, and Kuwait. The company acquired the German TILL Group, a former distribution partner, in November 2006, and in April 2007, Bene acquired a long-term business partner in Belgium.
