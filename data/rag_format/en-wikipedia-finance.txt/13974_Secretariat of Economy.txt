# Secretariat of Economy



In Mexico, the **Secretariat of the Economy** (Spanish: *Secretaría de Economía*; abbreviated "SE") is the government department in charge of matters related to the economy. The Secretary of the Economy is a member of the federal executive cabinet appointed by the President of the Republic.

Until 2000 the name of the Secretariat of the Economy was the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development (Secofi) but that name was changed when Vicente Fox acceded to the presidency.
