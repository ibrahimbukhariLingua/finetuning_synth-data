## Research

Hitt has contributed to the field of business, economics and management by studying strategic entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, international strategy and resource orchestration.


### Strategic entrepreneurship

Hitt has researched strategic entrepreneurship throughout his career. In the late 1990s, he and Duane Ireland began integrating research in entrepreneurship and strategic management, suggesting that firms need both strategic planning and entrepreneurial qualities for long-term success. He co-authored the book *Strategic Management: Competitiveness and Globalization* with Ireland and Robert Hoskisson, observing that younger firms may excel in entrepreneurship but lack strategic vision, while established firms may prioritize strategy but become risk-averse, leaving them vulnerable to innovative competitors. Following this, in 2001, he and Ireland co-edited a special issue in the *Strategic Management Journal* on strategic entrepreneurship, thereafter writing several conceptual pieces explaining its theoretical base. He was also a lead author on a paper published in *Academy of Management Perspectives* in 2011 which detailed their more developed thinking on strategic entrepreneurship.


### Mergers and acquisitions

Hitt's work on mergers and acquisitions focused on the effects on innovation and characteristics. He started working on this subject in the late 1980s, with his first article published in 1991, where he examined the impact of acquisitive growth on managerial commitment to innovation, suggesting that factors like the acquisition process and post-acquisition conditions influence managers' dedication to innovation, shaping strategic decision-making. In a study funded by the NSF, he discovered why M&As often have longer term negative effects on firm innovation, including the concept of suspended animation of R&D projects in target firms during the time of negotiations. Later, his research further expanded to identifying the characteristics of high performing and low performing M&As. He co-wrote a book, *Mergers and Acquisitions: A Guide to Creating Value for Stakeholders*, alongside Jeffrey Harrison and Ireland, which utilized a resource orchestration framework to examine which combinations of acquiring and target firms' capabilities are likely to create the most value for stakeholders. Ithai Stern stated that the work is "a travel guide holding everything you need to know for a perfect journey through the world of mergers and acquisitions."


### International strategy and institutions

Hitt explored the effects of institutions on international strategies, with his early research focusing on how international diversification impacts firm performance, noting initial benefits, diminishing returns, and implications for competitive advantage in product-diversified firms. He looked into country institutions which then extended to regional institutions because firms often focus their international market entries in regions and countries therein. This research has extended to the focus on the effects of polycentric institutions on entrepreneurial strategies and entrepreneurs' social networks across countries as well as how firm resources affect their international strategies. Most recently, he investigated how major environmental disruptions, like pandemics, have affected country institutions that in turn have affected firms' international strategies such as the global or regional supply chains.


### Resource orchestration

Hitt studied the corporate strategies of resource orchestration for improved management as well. He conducted research on firm competencies, corporate strategies, and the resource-based view, noting early criticisms of its static nature. Alongside David Sirmon and Ireland, he developed a dynamic model for resource management to create customer value and competitive advantage. Thereafter, he collaborated and published several empirical studies testing parts of the model proposed in the former article. Additionally, in 2011, he extended the original model, referring to it as resource orchestration, contrasting it with Adner and Helfat's concept of asset orchestration.
