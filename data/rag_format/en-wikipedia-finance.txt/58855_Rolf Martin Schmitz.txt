## Positions

According to Schmitz, the continued usage of existing coal plants and of new gas plants over the coming decades should remain a vital part of the energy mix for Germany. Schmitz stated that the energy transformation into renewables relies on energy suppliers to provide security of supply and large-scale solutions for power-storage. He has described RWE as a "cornerstone" and a "security partner" for the turnaround and the future of Germany's energy market.

Schmitz requested from Germany's government to provide a stable political framework for the energy market of the coming decades in order to allow suppliers to set up business plans accordingly. He rejected additional national CO₂ emissions trading conditions or an additional minimum price, exceeding the agreements which have been reached on the EU level.
