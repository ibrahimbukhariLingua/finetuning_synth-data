Products in this category can be further divided according to two types of production processes: animal farming for commercial purposes and processing and manufacture of cooked food products.


##### Animal farming for commercial purposes

Products from animal farming for commercial purposes include live chickens, eggs, live ducks, and live swine which are distributed to sales representatives throughout the country. The products are also distributed in surrounding local areas, to wholesalers and retailers, or to the company's processing plants or other processing plants in Thailand.

The company has offices across the country, which act as centers for technical information to farmers on how to properly raise animals to obtain fast growth as well as assistance with marketing and distribution.

The company has a support program for the farming of swine and broilers. The company selects farmers who have their own farms and farming equipment. Selected farmers receive support in the areas of animal breeds, animal feed, medication, and farming knowledge from the company.

The company adds value to processed meat products by flavoring and cooking through the process of boiling, steaming, frying, baking and grilling according to customer specifications.

Products derived from processing are one of the important products in the food products category of the aquaculture business. The main products are processed fresh shrimp and value-added processed shrimp, most of which are produced for export as chilled and frozen products and distributed through importers in various countries. The selling prices are also determined by agreement if the products have been manufactured according to customer specifications.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Controversies


### Slavery allegations

In June 2014, after a several-month-long investigation, the British newspaper *The Guardian* claimed that Charoen Pokphand Foods (CPF) purchases fishmeal, which it then feeds to its farmed prawns, from suppliers that own, operate, or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves. *The Guardian* claimed that after the slaves are bought "for as little as £250", the working conditions on those boats included forced labor with 20-hour work days, forced drug use, starvation, and executions.

In July 2014, CP Foods hosted a three-day meeting to create a task force on the issue, with representatives from retailers, local government authorities, and non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam and the Environmental Justice Foundation. The progress made at this meeting is difficult to ascertain, as the original newspaper, *The Guardian*, has not posted any additional stories and the company website's sustainability page says "For the latest general update covering our approach and achievements" to read a page from December 2013, which promises "a further progress update in Q1 2014."

The president and CEO of Charoen Pokphand subsequently posted a "Statement to Shareholders" vowing to purchase only from certified processing plants, only acquire product from certified Thai fisheries, and that supply chain "...fishing vessels, fishmeal processing plants...must be certified by Thailand's Labor Standard or have been audited...by an external agency (Third Party)...."

In Australia, Woolworths stocks only CPF-Vietnam products and Metcash, wholesale supplier to Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA), has eliminated CPF SKUs from their inventory.

In January 2017, the United States District Court, Northern District of California ruled on multiple grounds in favour of CP Foods in relation to litigation brought against them and others, which claimed damages related to the alleged presence of human rights abuses in the supply chain for Thai shrimp. The Court's order - dismissal with prejudice - bars the plaintiffs from bringing such claims again.

CPF has faced criticism for maintaining its business operations in Russia despite the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. CPF's presence in Russia includes a representative office, feed mills, and livestock complexes, making it one of the top ten largest meat producers in the country. In August 2021, the company invested heavily in Russia, acquiring two swine businesses for 22 billion rubles (approximately $300 million at the time). While many international companies have withdrawn from Russia in response to global sanctions and in protest of its military aggression, CPF has continued its operations, benefiting from food supply shortages exacerbated by the conflict. In 2022, CPF reported record revenues of 513 billion baht, attributing part of its growth to disruptions caused by the war. This has drawn criticism for prioritizing profits over ethical considerations, as the company indirectly supports Russia’s economy amidst widespread condemnation of its actions in Ukraine.
