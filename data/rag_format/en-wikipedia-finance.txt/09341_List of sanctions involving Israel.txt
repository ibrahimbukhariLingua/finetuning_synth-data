List of sanctions involving Israel


# List of sanctions involving Israel



This is a list of economic sanctions involving Israel.


## Background

Israeli settler violence received greater attention by the US government following the outbreak of the Israelâ€“Hamas war in October 2023.
While Rights groups have demanded US Secretary of State Blinken to punish Israeli settlement groups for their actions against Palestinians in the West Bank, many have also stressed that the sanctions do not go far enough because the Israeli government supports the settlements itself.
During a visit to Israel on November 30, Blinken raised concerns over the lack of action by the Israeli government regarding violent settlers. On December 5, 2023, Blinken introduced new visa restrictions regarding entry to the US of persons who committed acts of violence in the West Bank. On February 1, 2024, US President Biden issued an executive order due to high levels of settler violence, forced displacement of Palestinians, and property destruction in the West Bank. The order imposes sanctions on foreign persons determined to be responsible for or complicit in actions that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank. It blocks their property interests in the US, suspends their entry into the country and prohibits transactions with sanctioned persons. The stated objective is to address events regarded by the administration as "an unusual and extraordinary threat" undermining US foreign policy objectives and threatening security in the region.

Sanctions were announced in February 2024 by the United Kingdom against extremist Israeli settlers who have violently attacked Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions include financial and travel restrictions with four settlers being sanctioned initially after documentation showed they engaged in systematic intimidation and violence against Palestinians; at times at gunpoint, to make them leave their homes.
Further sanctions against violent settlers were announced by the European Union on April 19, 2024, as the European Council blacklisted the right-wing organizations Lehava and Hilltop Youth and the individuals Meir Ettinger, Elisha Yered, Neria Ben Pazi and Yinon Levi.
Because of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem on February 28, France imposed sanctions against extremist Israeli settlers, including a ban on entering French territory. Also, Emanuel Macron's office said they are considering extending sanctions on Israeli settlers.
