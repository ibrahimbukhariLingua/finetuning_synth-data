## Markets


### Singapore


#### Consumer broadband

MyRepublic offers fibre broadband and voice services to residential customers in Singapore over the country's Next-Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN). In 2012, the company launched in Singapore with fibre broadband Internet plans offering speeds of up to 150 Mbit/s and the country's first no-contract term Internet plans.

In February 2012, MyRepublic rolled out its GAMER fibre broadband packages, becoming Singapore's first Internet service provider to offer fibre broadband plans specifically catered towards gamers. MyRepublic is most well-known for its GAMER fibre broadband package, which features lower latency for popular games.

In May 2015, MyRepublic launched the first-ever 1 Gbps no-contract fibre broadband plan in Singapore. The plan targets users who want greater flexibility and are unwilling to commit to a 12—or 24-month contract.

According to the internet analysis firm's Q4 Speedtest, in September 2021, MyRepublic became the country's fastest provider, recording a Speed Score of 258.01.


#### Enterprise Connectivity

The company also offers fibre broadband, voice, and managed Wi-Fi services to business customers nationwide.

In 2016, it launched MySDN, its first enterprise connectivity service, available to customers across the region, including Singapore, Indonesia, and New Zealand.

In 2022, MyRepublic announced the launch of Ignite, a brand-new suite of enterprise ICT (Information and Communications Technology) specialized for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore.


#### MyRepublic Digital

MyRepublic Digital is a spin-off company of MyRepublic that aims to simplify and increase the productivity of digital transformation for telcos and aspiring digital brands worldwide. The company's product is Encore, a cloud-native digital platform-as-a-service with OSS/BSS features.

MyRepublic Digital is helmed by Jason Ong, previously APAC (Asia Pacific) region head of Tech Mahindra.


#### Bid to be Singapore's fourth telco

In 2014, MyRepublic announced its interest in being Singapore's 4th telco, after Singtel, StarHub, and M1, promising to introduce unlimited mobile data plans as a telco.

In April 2015, MyRepublic announced plans to hold a mobility trial in Jurong Lake District in the second half of 2015 as part of the Government's trial of HetNet, or heterogeneous network. HetNet is a new wireless system that leveraged NBN as part of a mobile network, allowing mobile phone users to hop across networks to minimize surfing slowdowns or disruptions automatically. As part of the trial, MyRepublic gave out 1,000 free SIM cards with unlimited 4G data to trial participants in the coverage area.

In September 2015, the company submitted its bid for the New Entrant Spectrum Auction (NESA) and two other companies - Australian telco TPG Telecom and Singapore start-up airYotta. Of the three, only MyRepublic and TPG were pre-qualified to participate in the NESA.

MyRepublic participated in the NESA in December 2016 but ultimately exited the auction at S$102.5 million and ceded the license to TPG, citing concerns that bidding higher would not make sense for its business case.

In May 2017, reports emerged that MyRepublic was looking for private equity backing to bid for Singaporean telecommunications company M1. This would allow it to get back into the Singapore Telco market despite losing the fourth telco license. In a press conference later that year, MyRepublic confirmed the report but added that it was no longer interested in buying M1 and would seek to offer mobile services as a virtual network operator (MVNO) instead.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


#### Mobile services offering

In May 2018, MyRepublic announced that it had formed a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) agreement with local telco StarHub, enabling it to offer services using StarHub's mobile infrastructure. In June 2018, MyRepublic rolled out three new mobile price plans, starting from S$35/month. For a "boundless" data offering, the plans allowed customers to continue to consume data at reduced speeds once they hit the data limit of their plans without additional charges.

In October 2020, MyRepublic and M1 Limited (M1) signed an agreement for MyRepublic to deliver an enhanced suite of mobile services as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) using M1's mobile network infrastructure.

In January 2023, MyRepublic announced its foray into 5G and introduced its 5G plan offerings using StarHub's 5G Standalone/4G/3G infrastructure. MyRepublic's 4G plan offerings will continue using M1's 4G/3G infrastructure.


#### Gigatown competition

In 2017, MyRepublic launched the "Gigatown" Competition to connect Australia's first town to consumer-grade 1 Gbps gigabit service. MyRepublic wanted to demonstrate the benefits of ultra-fast next-generation fiber and the benefits it could deliver to consumers and small businesses. MyRepublic ran the Gigatown petition and gathered over 6,000 responses from individuals who expressed their feelings towards how they felt about their current internet speeds. MyRepublic began offering their 1 Gbit/s speed tier packages to Wollongong at A$129/month with unlimited data as part of their Gigatown Competition. At the end of 2017, MyRepublic expanded and launched NBN Small Business products to market.

MyRepublic announced to its customers on 24 January 2023 that it would be exiting the Australian fixed broadband market and transferring customers to Superloop.


### Indonesia

In July 2015, MyRepublic launched in Indonesia, marking MyRepublic's second overseas expansion after New Zealand. MyRepublic began offering broadband services in nine areas in Indonesia.

In 2021, MyRepublic Indonesia targeted enterprise space and increased its service offerings for this customer sector to include cybersecurity.
