Pacific Community Ventures pioneered a new kind of venture-philanthropy, integrating traditional investment, active support and impact measurement into its funding equation. From 1998 to 2015, Pacific Community Ventures raised and deployed more than $100 million in philanthropic and community-focused capital. These investments helped 3,000 California businesses to create or retain more than 30,000 jobs.
