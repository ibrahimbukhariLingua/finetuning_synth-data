Anti-Money Laundering Authority


# Anti-Money Laundering Authority



The **Anti-Money Laundering Authority** (**AMLA**), formally known as the **Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism**, is an agency of the European Union, established in 2024 in Frankfurt.

AMLA's establishment has been characterized as "much-needed" by major EU political forces, and it has been described as transformational by a wide range of observers. It is expected to strengthen the policy framework to ensure the integrity of the EU financial system, as the central component of the EU's anti-money laundering efforts. Since jan 2025 it's chair is Bruna Szego.


## Background

In February 2018, the demise of ABLV Bank triggered a debate on the structure of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervision in the European Union. A few weeks later, ECB Supervisory Board chair Danièle Nouy declared that it is “very embarrassing to depend on the United States to do the [AML] job. This has to change [...] We need a European institution that is implementing in a thorough, deep, consistent fashion this [AML] legislation in the euro area”.² In October 2018, the think-tank Bruegel published a study recommending the creation of a European AML Authority and providing a blueprint for its key features.

The European Commission first proposed AMLA in July 2021 after a series of financial scandals further exposed significant flaws in AML supervision. Described as a "game-changer in cracking down on dirty money in the EU," AMLA is intended to curb illicit financial flows while improving coordination between governmental intelligence authorities within the bloc. On 22 February 2024, it was announced that AMLA would be located in Frankfurt.


## Establishment

The EU Regulation establishing AMLA entered into force on 26 June 2024. That same day, the newly established agency advertised an open position for its chair. The Frankfurt office is expected to open in 2025 and become fully functional by 2028.
