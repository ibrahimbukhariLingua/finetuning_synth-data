# Hellenic Duty Free Shops



**Hellenic Duty Free Shops SA**, founded in 1979, is a Greek company in the travel retail industry. The company holds the exclusive right to the retail sale of duty-free goods in Greece.

It has a network in Greece, composed of 97 shops at 45 points (22 airports, 11 border checkpoints, and 12 ports).


## History


### 1900s

The company was founded in 1979 to provide duty-free goods to travelers leaving through Greek border checkpoints. Two shops were launched, one at the Eastern, and one at the Western Airport in Athens, Greece.

In 1998 "Hellenic Duty Free Shops" was listed on the Athens Stock Exchange.

The abolition of the sale of duty-free goods to passengers travelling within Europe in 1999 was a crucial point for the future of duty-free shopping. By adopting single discount prices (travel value policy) in all product categories (with the exception of tobacco and alcohol), the company maintained its special prices by absorbing, along with its suppliers, taxes, and duties.

In 2000 the first stage of privatization was completed with the transfer of a 79% stake to the Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE).


### 2000s

In 2000, the new Athens Airport was opened in the area of Spata Attica. The commercial area in the new airport was designed on the basis of the specifications for modern shopping centers, creating new growth prospects. The company launched four shops there. Today, at Athens International Airport, 31 shops are in operation (12 in intra-Schengen Departures, 12 on the extra-Schengen Departures level, four in the free zone and three in the Arrivals hall, in the baggage claim area).

In 2006 privatization of the company was completed. "Links London Ltd" and "Elmec Sports SA" were acquired in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The subsidiary «Hellenic Distributions SΑ» was founded in 2001.
