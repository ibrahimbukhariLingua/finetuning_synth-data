Agriculture in Singapore


# Agriculture in Singapore




**Agriculture in Singapore** is a small industry, composing about 0.5% of the total GDP, within the city-state of Singapore.

Singapore's reliance on imports for about 90% of its food underscores the paramount importance of food security. To address this, Singapore has set a goal to produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.


## History

Agriculture in Singapore became heavily reduced as early as 1987. In that year, there were officially 2,075 farms in the country, covering an area of 2,037 hectares (5,030 acres), an average of less than 1 hectare (2.5 acres) per farm.

Before modernised development, Orchard Road was a stretch of agricultural orchards. As with many other areas, the farms there soon began to disappear, and Singapore became more reliant on overseas imports. One major issue in 1984 was the health concerns with pig farms in Singapore, concerning the pollution of the environment.


## Major agricultural products


### Food crops

Fruits produced in Singapore include durians, rambutans, and mangosteens, while edible fungus produced in the country include mushrooms. There are also farms in the country responsible for the production of eggs, vegetables, poultry, and pork.


### Flower crops

Flowers grown in Singapore are exported to other parts of the world, namely Japan, the United States, Australia, and territories in Western Europe. Such flowers include orchids. There are 153 orchid farms in Singapore. Plants are mostly cultivated in Singapore for decorative purposes.


### Fishing

Fish grown in Singapore are mostly kept as aquarium fish, though some fish farms rear fish as food items. Qian Hu Corporation Limited is a major fishery in Singapore, farming, exporting, and importing some thousand fish species. On 5 June 2020, the Singapore Food Agency announced that domestic Singapore consumers will eventually be able to buy wholesale seafood at a single location at some time in the coming years, with Jurong Fishery Port and Senoko Fishery Port being consolidated by 2023.

In 2022, Singapore produced around 4.2 thousand metric tons fish.
