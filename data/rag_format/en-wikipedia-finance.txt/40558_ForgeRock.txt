**ForgeRock, Inc.** is an identity and access management software company headquartered in San Francisco. On August 23, 2023, Thoma Bravo announced that it had completed the acquisition of the company for approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, it has been reported that ForgeRock integrated into its portfolio the company Ping Identity.


## Overview

ForgeRock was founded in Norway in February 2010 by a group of former Sun Microsystems employees, after Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation. After the acquisition, the software was scheduled for phase-out in favor of Oracle’s in-house product, so the founders "started their own company to fork the code and continue developing Sun’s software."

In April 2020, ForgeRock announced that it has raised $93.5 million in funding, a Series E it will use to continue expanding, which "brings the total raised by the company to $230 million." The company went public in September 2021. It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FORG. On October 11, 2022, private equity firm, Thoma Bravo, agreed to purchase ForgeRock for $2.3 billion in an all-cash deal. After the acquisition was completed in August 2023, the new owner reported that ForgeRock would be integrated into its company portfolio Ping Identity.
