# BancFirst



**BancFirst Corporation**, operating under the name **BancFirst**, is a state-chartered bank in Oklahoma, United States. It has over 100 banking locations serving 60 communities throughout the state of Oklahoma.


## History

The roots of BancFirst date back to 1966, when lead investor and Chairman H.E. "Gene" Rainbolt purchased Federal National Bank in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Federal National had $16 million in assets at the time of purchase. Throughout the 1970s, Rainbolt acquired interests in many rural Oklahoma banks and formed Thunderbird Financial Corporation to assist each bank with management services. In 1985, Rainbolt's banks in seven communities were brought under the ownership of United Community Corporation.

On April 1, 1989, BancFirst was formed and established its corporate headquarters in downtown Oklahoma City. Changes in Oklahoma's banking laws that allowed multiple banks to merge in such a fashion were largely due to Gene Rainbolt's efforts to modernize the law.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1993, through an initial public offering, BancFirst began trading on the NASDAQ under stock symbol BANF. It has continued to grow through acquisitions.ʷʰⁱᶜʰ?
