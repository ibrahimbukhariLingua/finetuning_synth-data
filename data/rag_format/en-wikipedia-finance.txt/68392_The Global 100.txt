The Global 100


# The Global 100



**The Global 100** Index is an annual ranking of the world's most sustainable corporations. The list is published by Toronto-based media and research company, Corporate Knights (and announced each year during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland). From its inception in February 2005 to January 2022, the Global 100 index made a net investment return of 331%, compared to 279% from the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI). The adoption of large green recovery programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is suspected to have widened this performance gap.


## History

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights magazine in 2005. The index was created with the intention of devising a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world's largest publicly traded companies. As a rules-based sustainability rating that emphasizes the impact of a company's core products and services, the Global 100 is the best-performing global sustainability index (ticker: CKG100).
