## Research


### Infant mortality

In work with Maya Rossin-Slater, Laura Wherry, Petra Persson, Gloria Aldana, and Kate Kennedy-Moulton, Miller leverages administrative data from California to examine inequalities in infant mortality across the income distribution. She finds that the incidence of pre-term births increases at higher incomes, but that mortality falls as income rises.

Miller also shows that infant mortality in black families systematically exceeds that of white families, with infants born to black women at the top of the income distribution dying at higher rates than white women at the bottom of the income distribution.


### Insurance expansions

Miller has also written several papers on the impacts of health insurance expansions, particularly the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions. In a paper with Laura Wherry and Norman Johnson in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Miller shows that after the onset of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions, near elderly mortality fell in expansion relative to non-expansion states, with results driven by disease-related deaths. Their results suggest that states' decisions not to expand Medicaid led to 15,600 excess deaths per year among those ages 55–64.

In related work published in the Journal of Public Economics, Miller and co-authors also show that the ACA Medicaid expansions improved the financial health of their beneficiaries, reducing the number and size of unpaid non-medical bills.

In work with Chloe East, Laura Wherry, and Marianne Page published in the American Economic Review, Miller shows that the grandchildren of low-income pregnant women who became Medicaid beneficiaries in the 1980s were less likely to have low birth weight than their non-insured counterparts.


### Universal basic income

With Eva Vivalt, David Broockman, Alex Bartik, and Elizabeth Rhodes, Miller is a principal investigator on Y Combinator's universal basic income experiment, in which unconditional cash transfers of $1,000 per month will be delivered to over 1,000 study participants across two states.
