# St1



**St1 Oy** is a Finnish energy company and a part of St1 Nordic group that operates in Finland, Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom. In Finland St1 Oy has a subsidiary called St1 Lämpöpuisto Oy as well as sister companies St1 Lähienergia Oy, focused on ground source heating solutions, and St1 Finance Oy that offers payment services to support customer loyalty.


## Retail station network

St1’s distribution network for transport fuels comprises over 400 St1 and Shell branded retail stations and gas filling points in Finland (2023). The Shell brand is in use under a license agreement. The network consists of unmanned stations and service stations with shops, convenience stores, restaurants and car washes as well as heavy goods vehicle (HGV) sites.

In addition, the goal of St1 is to build a nationwide biogas network of liquefied biogas (LBG) fueling stations for heavy-duty vehicles in Finland.

St1 has strong market positions in all Nordic countries. In 2022 the company’s market share was 24.9% in petrol and 20.7% in diesel in Finland.


## Fuels

The main source of petrol and diesel sold in St1’s retail station network is the St1 refinery in Gothenburg, Sweden. The goal of St1 is to reduce fossil CO₂ emissions in traffic step-by-step by bringing high-quality fuels with a lower environmental impact into the market.

In 2021 St1 launched on the Finnish market Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil diesel. Renewable HVO diesel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 90% compared to fossil diesel. St1 has also developed and introduced waste-based RE85 high-blend ethanol fuel in Finland.

St1 is building liquefied biogas (LBG) refueling stations for heavy transport around Finland. LBG is a renewable fuel that can be produced e.g. from the manure and other agricultural by-products of cattle farms – as St1 is planning to do in Finland in cooperation with food company Valio.

Shell retail stations in Finland are selling Shell V-Power – a petrol that Shell has developed in cooperation with Ferrari.
