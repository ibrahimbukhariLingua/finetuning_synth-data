Banca Commerciale Italiana


# Banca Commerciale Italiana



**Banca Commerciale Italiana** (**BCI**, colloquially known as **Comit**), founded in 1894, was a major Italian bank based in Milan. In 1999, it merged with the group recently formed by the combination of Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde and Banco Ambroveneto to form IntesaBCI, in which BCI temporarily became a sub-holding company. On 1 January 2003, the group's name changed to Banca Intesa, later Intesa Sanpaolo.


## History

BCI's predecessor was the Credito Mobiliare, founded in 1862.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On 10 October 1894, BCI was re-established as a private joint-stock bank with capital contributed by banks from Germany (78 percent), Austria (13 percent), and Switzerland (9 percent).⁹¹ These included Creditanstalt, Deutsche Bank, Darmstädter Bank, Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft, Disconto-Gesellschaft, and S. Bleichröder, with stakes from 10 to 13 percent each, whereas the other participating German and Swiss banks had individual stakes in the low single digits. The Germanic dominance didn’t last long, however, as the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas also became a significant shareholder in 1898.⁸⁰ BCI was originally modelled along the lines of German banks, making both short- and long-term loans. The young BCI continued to specialize in loans to industry, especially to companies in shipping, textiles, and electricity.
Giuseppe Toeplitz was the managing director of Banca Commerciale Italiana. His Villa Toeplitz is still located in Varese

In the mid of the 20th century, the bank was nationalized by Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. In 1936, along with Banco di Roma and Credito Italiano, they were classified as "a bank of national interest" under the Banking Law of 1936.

In 1999 70% shares of BCI were acquired by Banca Intesa.

On 1 January 2001 BCI sold Banca di Legnano to Banca Popolare di Milano. In the same year, the company was absorbed into the parent company.
