Sáenz joined Banco Santander in 1994 as a board member. From 2002 until 2013 he was vice chairman and CEO. He resigned as CEO on 29 April 2013, before the Bank of Spain had to make a ruling on the court case from 1994.

During 2012, Alfredo Sáenz was chosen second best CEO in European Banking. That year, during his tenure as CEO, Banco Santander was named 'Best Bank in the world' by the business magazine Euromoney.

## Banned

In 2011, the Supreme Court of Spain gave Sáenz a three-month ban from working as a banker, after a long legal action. He was convicted in 2009 of false accusations against presumed debtors to Banesto, now a Santander subsidiary, who were briefly jailed over the affair in 1994. Santander said he would appeal the decision, and that Sáenz would continue in his job.

If the crime stood as convicted, he would lose his job; CEOs in Spain must be of good moral repute. On account of this, the authorities converted his prison sentence to a pardon, and replaced it with a lower penalty, in the form of a nominal fine.

However, in February 2013, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that the Spanish government had overstepped its authority in pardoning him. The Bank of Spain then opened new proceedings in the case.

Sáenz retired from Banco Santander in 2013, cutting off the possibility of his being banned from the Spanish banking industry.


## Pay

According to Forbes.com, in 2007 Sáenz had a salary of €3 million, with a bonus of €5.5 million and additional earnings of just under €0.9 million for a total "compensation" of €9.6 million. In 2009, his total compensation was €10.2 million.
