Bustos Media


# Bustos Media



**Bustos Media L.L.C.** is a media corporation headquartered in Portland, Oregon.

Bustos Media specializes in operating Spanish-language, and other ethnic, radio stations in the United States. Most of its stations broadcast in Spanish; however, two of the company's stations have the Portland, Oregon, market's only full-time Russian language formats (KOOR and KGDD).


## History

The company, originally headquartered in Sacramento, California, was founded in July 2003 by Amador Bustos and his brother John Bustos, with investments from Providence Equity Partners, Providence, R.I., Alta Communications, Boston, and Opportunity Capital, Fremont, California. The Sacramento-based Bustos Media, a private broadcasting company specializing in Spanish language radio, has over $100 million in private equity. "Amador Bustos has built two radio empires catering to the tastes of America's Spanish-speaking population." Station is currently owned by ADELANTE MEDIA OF CALIFORNIA LICENSE LLC

In 1992, the Amador brothers, with $3 million in private equity investment from Syndicated Communications (SYNCOM), launched Z-Spanish Radio Network, Inc. Over a period of eight years they acquired 32 radio stations. In 2000, Z-Spanish sold the chain to Entravision Communications at a total valuation of $475 million.

In May 2006, Bustos Media gained approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch a Spanish-language television station in Milwaukee with programming from Azteca América. As of 2009, Bustos Media had 25 radio stations across the U.S. and several television stations.

In January 2010 Bustos Media revealed that it was in technical default with its lenders. On June 30, 2010, Bustos Media announced that the stations would be transferred to NAP Broadcast Holdings LLC, a company named for and controlled by its senior lenders, pending FCC approval. As part of the agreement, Amador and John Bustos resigned, effective immediately.

In September 2010 NAP Broadcasting closed on the merger and announced that they would proceed under the name "Adelante Media Group".

The Bustoses were able to keep some stations in Oregon, California and Texas. In 2011, Bustos Media repurchased the Adelante stations in Portland. Bustos reacquired several radio stations in Washington from Adelante Media Group for $6 million in 2014; the following year, the company bought back WDDW in Milwaukee from Adelante for $1 million.
