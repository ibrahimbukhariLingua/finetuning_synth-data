| Rishi is revealed to be deep in debt: not only does he owe £200,000 to loan sharks due to gambling — with a further £20,000 in vig overdue — but took a £300 million long position on pound sterling against the US dollar during the 12-hour risk limit increase that Adler granted him the day of Lumi's IPO. Rishi is relying on a rumored top-rate tax cut to raise the value of the pound, otherwise risking a significant chunk of Pierpoint's money. During an office Christmas party, Rishi collects a total of £8,000 from several employees — ostensibly for betting on horse races — and gambles it at a casino. He initially wins big, parties (getting into a fight with a patron), then gambles his newly earned cash, only to lose it all. Rishi goes home and has an argument with his wife Diana over his infidelity and gambling addiction, during which she admits to an affair with a family friend whose cricket pavilion Rishi is renovating. Diana agrees to cover Rishi's loan debts. The next day, however, Pierpoint receives word that the UK chancellor is approving the tax cut, finally raising the value of the pound and netting Rishi £18 million. Venetia, meanwhile, decides to leave Pierpoint. Rishi cathartically ransacks the pavilion the next day and calls his loan shark to report that he has recovered his money, only to take out another loan to gamble away. | | | | | | | |

| Lumi is subject to a select committee inquiry following its collapse and subsequent £2 billion bailout by the government, which was funded by taxpayers and left millions of low-income households using Lumi with mounting energy bills. Robert is sent as Pierpoint's representative in the hearings, quickly realizing he is to be their scapegoat. Aurore, however, takes full responsibility for Lumi's failure and resigns from her cabinet position. After the hearings, Henry takes Robert to a member's club, where Aurore reveals that her performance at the hearings was a ploy to win over the public in preparation to run for prime minister. Meanwhile, recently-hired Pierpoint trader Sweetpea Golightly tells Eric she discovered that the outsize debt Pierpoint issued to fund its ESG pivot is now reaching maturity, but cannot be paid off due to the string of failed ESG IPOs post-Lumi. Eric tells Sweetpea to keep it quiet, but Harper overhears Sweetpea telling Yasmin in the bathroom. Adler later confirms to Eric that Pierpoint is on the brink of collapse, and reveals that he is dying of a malignant brain tumor. Robert joins Henry on an ayahuasca trip and hallucinates visions of Nicole and his mother - he returns home the next morning at peace. Yasmin joins him in his bed and the two have an honest conversation, where Yasmin says she killed her father; Robert laughs it off as a joke. | | | | | | | |
