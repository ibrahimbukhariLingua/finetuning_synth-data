## History


### As Global Gateway Logistics City

Clark Global City was initially known as the Global Gateway Logistics City (GGLC). It was conceptualized by American firm Peregrine Development International Inc. (PDII) to the Kuwaiti investment firm KGL Investment Co. (KGLI Co.) in 2006. KGLI accepted PDII's proposal and signed a memorandum of agreement with the Clark International Airport Corporation regarding the project in April 2008. The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in August of the same year. KGLI was owner and developer of the GGLC through Global Gateway Development Corp (GGDC).

The GGLC was later renamed as the Sabah Al-Ahmad Global Gateway Logistics City in March 2012 honor of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait who had a state visit to the Philippines within that same month.

GGDC assumed operational control over the project's development in 2014 following a legal dispute with PDII over alleged breaches by the latter over the engineering, procurement and management (EPCM) agreement the two companies entered.
