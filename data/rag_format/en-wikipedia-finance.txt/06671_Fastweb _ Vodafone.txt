## History

On March 15, 2024, Swisscom signed a binding purchase proposal to acquire 100% of Vodafone Italia for â‚¬8 billion, with the aim of merging it with Fastweb. As part of the agreement, Vodafone will continue to provide Fastweb with certain services, as well as grant the use of its brand for a maximum period of five years.

In September 2024, the Antitrust Authority published the decision to initiate an investigation. Swisscom announced that the European Commission had approved the acquisition of Vodafone Italia under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation. The transaction was approved by AGCOM and AGCM in November and December 2024, respectively.

On December 31, 2024, Swisscom, through Fastweb, completed the acquisition of Vodafone Italia, giving rise to Fastweb + Vodafone.
