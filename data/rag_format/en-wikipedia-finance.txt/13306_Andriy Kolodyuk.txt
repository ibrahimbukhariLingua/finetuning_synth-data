### Since 2022

During the Revolution of Dignity, Kolodyuk was one of the organizers of the IT tent on the Independence Square in Kyiv.


## Controversies

Although Kolodyuk presents himself as professional and honest investor profiling himself as an expert in that domain, all of his so called investments and businesses are linked to and spoiled with serious elements of financial abuse, forgery of documents, abuse of company-assets and opportunistic self-enrichment

In 2015, the Ministry of Internal Affairs seized 2 servers and computer equipment from Divan.TV. The reason for this intervention was a statement made to the Darnytskyi District Court by the Chairman of the ‘Anti-Pirate Committee’ on broadcasting the Russian TV channel "HD Kino 100". After a two-months trial-case the claim against the company was dismissed, and the equipment was returned.[¹]

In 2019, a media campaign was launched with as a major goal to compromise Kolodyuk among colleagues and partners. On his Facebook account, he reported that ‘he feels a psychological pressure in order to steel his business in a corporate raid manner’.[²]

In the spring of the same year, 2019, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Kolodyuk with the objective to repay a total debt of $3.8 million. The plaintiffs were Mykola Novikov and Karine Chiftalaryan. The news was immediately picked up by a number of Ukrainian media. According to Kolodyuk, he borrowed money from Ruben Chiftalaryan, whose grandson was one of the plaintiffs, and reimbursed to them with as well real estate and corporate rights to assets as with liquid money.[³]

In reality, the real estate offered by Kolodyuk turned out to be a bogus for the simple reason that the real estate did not belong to him or to any possible guarantor. On the other hand, the corporate rights to company assets, offered as a guarantee by Kolodyuk, were as well based on professionally falsified documents.

At the end of 2021, the claim of the payment of the major amount of $ 3.8 million, launched by Mykola Novikov and Karina Chiftalaryan was denied by the Kyiv Court of Appeals.[³] That amount of $ 3.8 million was the original amount of nearly one million $ borrowed by Kolodyuk from Novikov and Chiftalaryan more than 10 years earlier, augmented with the accrued interests over the years. The Court therefore only withheld the initial amount to be paid back to Novikov and Chiftalaryan. Finally, Kolodyuk did not perform and didn’t respect the terms of this condemnation.

Subsequently, the independent media monitoring service ‘Attack Index’ released an investigation calling all media reports concerning Kolodyuk lawsuits a planned information attack against Kolodyuk and estimated such a media campaign worth near $20,000.[⁴].

In September 2021, Kolodyuk sold 100 % of the shares of Finart Capital Invest, owner of DivanTV to the Luxembourg Company Tathkrah General Trading Company belonging to the Belgian entrepreneur Jan Thys for the sum of 3 million euros. In order to justify and support the value of this deal, he presented to them a full (accountability) file made by a well-known USA-based revisor company. It turned out to be a complete forgery. First of all, it was established that Kolodyuk and/or his company did not possess the 100 % of the shares, only possessing 51 % of the shares. The other 49% of the shares was owned by 3 different Ukrainian shareholders. Finally, an investigation revealed that the 51% so called “owned“ shares had been given as a guarantee, a collateral on behalf of the debt of Kolodyuk towards Novikov and Chiftalaryan. With the result and conclusion that the sales of the shares had to be considered as completely illegal. The other Ukrainian shareholders filed the case in Court resulting in a cancelling of the transaction and a restoring of the initial situation. However, the transfer-sum of € 3 million was not returned to the Belgian beneficiary Thys. A file before the Belgian Criminal Court was filed against Kolodyuk and is pending. This was possible as Kolodyuk - although he was banned by the Ukrainian Court to leave Ukraine – ignored the ban and settled in Belgium, requesting the status of ‘Ukrainian Refugee’.

The Belgian Criminal Court was additionally seized for 2 supplementary criminal complaints against Kolodyuk (and his partner Olesia Berezovets) for the same qualified crimes as there are forgery of documents, theft, embezzlement of funds and abuse of company assets.

Since his arrival in Belgium, he created and launched a number of NGO’s with the social purpose of: raising funds officially on behalf and the purpose of rebuilding Ukraine, but, in practice, used exclusively for personal purposes and enrichment.

n 2015, the Ministry of Internal Affairs seized 2 servers and computer equipment from Divan.tv. The reason was a statement to the Darnytskyi District Court from the Chairman of the Anti-Pirate Committee on broadcasting the Russian TV channel "HD Kino 100". After 2 months the company won the courts, and the equipment was returned.

In 2019, the media spread the materials that were intended to compromise Kolodyuk among colleagues and partners. In his Facebook, he reported that he feels a psychological pressure in order to steel his business in a corporate raid manner.

In the spring of the same year, 2019, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Kolodyuk to repay a total debt of $3.8 million. The plaintiffs were Mykola Novikov and Karine Chiftalaryan. The news was immediately picked up by a number of Ukrainian media. According to Kolodyuk, he borrowed money from Ruben Chiftalaryan, whose grandson was one of the plaintiffs, and returned them witt real estate and corporate rights to assets as weel as with money.

At the end of 2021, the Kyiv Court of Appeals denied Mykola Novikov and Karina Chiftalaryan a claim against Kolodyuk in the amount of $3.8 million.

Subsequently, the independent media monitoring service Attack Index released an investigation in which it called all media reports concerning Kolodyuk lawsuits a planned information attack against Kolodyuk, and estimated such a media campaign worth near $20,000.
