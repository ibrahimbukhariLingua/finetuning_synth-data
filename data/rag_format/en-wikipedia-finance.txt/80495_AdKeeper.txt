AdKeeper


# AdKeeper



**AdKeeper** was an online advertising platform that allowed consumers to keep online ads for future use. A button was inserted into advertising creative elements, and was visible to users as a small button in the ad with the letter “k” inside the button. Consumers could click on the k button to keep the ads, and then return to the cloud-based Adkeeper at a future time, to review the ads they had kept. The users could also share ads with others, via email or social networks.


## Features

AdKeeper provided users with a personal "Keeper", where they could come to view ads they've collected from various places on the Internet, or the Ad Gallery display area in AdKeeper. Ads that are kept display the date they were kept, when they expire, a short description, and also allow for users to rate them, when they are logged in. Common social sharing tools, such as Email, Twitter, and Facebook are available, and in the aforementioned gallery, users can keep more ads from participating advertisers.


## History

AdKeeper was founded in March, 2010, by Scott Kurnit, who serves as Chairman and CEO. Kurnit is best known as the founder of *About.com*, which grew to a public market value of $1.7 billion, and was sold to Primedia for $724 million, in 2001. *About* is now owned by IAC.

AdKeeper operated in stealth until October, 2010, when it launched in private beta. The AdKeeper service became generally available to consumers on February 14, 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
