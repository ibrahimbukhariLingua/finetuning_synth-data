Glass's Guide


# Glass's Guide



**Glass's Guide** is the leading British motor trades guide to used car prices, often referred to in the trade as "the bible". Monitoring car values since 1933, it reflects how cars have become increasingly affordable – the £145 list price for a Ford 10 De Luxe (including £5 for an optional sliding roof) was the equivalent of almost two years' salary.


## William Glass

William Glass was born in Scotland in 1881 and was an engineer by trade. As well as publishing the first Guide to Used Vehicle Values, he had an innovative and enquiring mind and made a number of inventions including the portable hydraulic jack, the electric switch-off kettle, the self-filling fountain pen and the through-the-propeller machine gun firing mechanism.

The founder of Glass's Guide also manufactured cars under the Firefly marque for a short period of time in Croydon. Glass's other innovations included the first motor auction and the first uniformed attendants at petrol filling stations.


## History

William Glass published the first Glass's Guide in July 1933. The company expanded into commercial vehicle, motorcycle and caravan values in the 1950s and 1960s, and today it provides electronic and online formats.
