# Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013



The **Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013** (H.R. 2052) is a bill that would require the United States Department of Commerce, in cooperation with the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group and other federal agencies, to "conduct a review of the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting foreign direct investment." The bill specifies what topics and subject matters are to be included in the report, and which laws or policies are not to be included. Finally, the bill also expressed the "sense of Congress" – non-binding statement of opinion - about the current situation of foreign direct investment in the United States and some related American goals. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.

H.R. 2052 would direct the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination with other relevant agencies, to review the competitiveness of the United States in attracting investment by foreign businesses. Within one year of enactment of the bill, the Secretary would be required to report to the Congress the results of the review as well as recommendations for increasing the United States’ ability to attract foreign investment.

Based on information from the Department of Commerce, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 2052 would cost about $1 million over the 2014-2018 period for staff and administrative activities involved in conducting the review and preparing the report. Enacting H.R. 2052 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.

H.R. 2052 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.
