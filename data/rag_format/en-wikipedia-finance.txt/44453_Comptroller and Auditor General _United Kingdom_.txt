Comptroller and Auditor General (United Kingdom)


# Comptroller and Auditor General (United Kingdom)



The **comptroller and auditor general** (**C&AG**) in the United Kingdom is the government official responsible for supervising the quality of public accounting and financial reporting. The C&AG is an officer of the House of Commons who is the head of the National Audit Office, the body that scrutinises central government expenditure.

Under the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 the C&AG is appointed by the monarch by letters patent upon an address of the House of Commons presented by the Prime Minister with the agreement of the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. The C&AG can be removed from office, also by the monarch, only upon an address of both Houses of Parliament.

The full title of the office is *Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of His Majesty's Exchequer and Auditor General of Public Accounts*.

The current C&AG is Gareth Davies (not the MP).


## History

The office of C&AG was created by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, which combined the functions of the Comptroller General of the Exchequer, who had authorised the issue of public moneys from the Treasury to other government departments, with those of the Commissioners of Audit, who had presented the government accounts to the Treasury). Under the terms of the Act the C&AG continued to authorise the issue of money to departments, but was also given the new task of examining departmental accounts and reporting the results to Parliament. The role has since been replicated in many Commonwealth and foreign countries.
