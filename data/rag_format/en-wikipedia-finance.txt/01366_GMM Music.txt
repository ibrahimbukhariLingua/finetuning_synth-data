## History


### Before restructuring

On February 27, 2023, the board of directors of GMM Grammy approved a major business restructuring of its music division. This involved a spin-off, transferring all music-related assets, personnel, rights, obligations, and contracts to a newly established subsidiary. The objective was to create a sustainable business model and improve operational efficiency. GMM Grammy would hold 100% ownership of the new subsidiary, and the Group Executive Board and/or the Group CEO (Busaba Daoruang), or a designated representative, were authorized to execute, amend, or modify details regarding the restructuring.

On July 3, GMM Grammy announced that it had completed the first phase of the restructuring by registering a new subsidiary, GMM Music Co., Ltd., with the Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce, on April 7. The company was established with a registered capital of 4 million THB, with GMM Grammy holding 100% ownership. The leadership of the new entity included Paiboon Damrongchaitham as chairman, Pawit Chittrakon as CEO, and Fahmai Damrongchaitham as Deputy CEO.

On July 27, the GMM Grammy board designated GMM Music as the flagship company for its music operations. Additionally, the board approved a plan for GMM Music to enter the public fundraising process through an initial public offering (IPO), offering up to 30% of its shares and listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The aim was to allow GMM Music to expand its business and promote the New Music Economy. The IPO listing process was subject to seven specific conditions. Since the IPO share allocation was limited to 30%, GMM Music would remain a subsidiary of GMM Grammy even after the public offering.


### After restructuring

On November 15, GMM Grammy announced the completion of the second phase of its music business restructuring as follows:

* August 2: The Group Executive Board of GMM Grammy approved the agreement and terms for the transfer of its entire music business, including contracts and related documents, to GMM Music.
* August 17: An extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of GMM Music approved the business transfer agreement from GMM Grammy. Additionally, the shareholders approved an increase in GMM Music's registered capital from 4 million THB to 800 million THB, which was officially registered on August 31.
* September 1: GMM Grammy transferred its entire music business to GMM Music, including assets, liabilities, obligations, and music-related personnel. Furthermore, GMM Music acquired GMM Grammy's ownership stakes in its music-related subsidiaries, including:
 + GMM Music Publishing International Co., Ltd. (100%)
 + G200M Co., Ltd. (100%)
 + GR Vocal Studio Co., Ltd. (65%)
 + YGMM Co., Ltd. (51%) This transfer was in accordance with the first condition for IPO listing approval.

As a result of this restructuring, GMM Music became a pure-play music company, specializing solely in the music and entertainment business. Meanwhile, GMM Grammy ceased to operate any significant business activities of its own. On November 14, the GMM Grammy Board of Directors approved a transition from an Operating Company to a Holding Company, meaning that GMM Music would become a non-listed major subsidiary focused on the core music business. Additionally, GMM O Shopping Co., Ltd. was designated as a non-listed major subsidiary operating a separate core business. This restructuring would be fully implemented following the completion of GMM Music's IPO.


### Transformation and Expansion of Partnerships
