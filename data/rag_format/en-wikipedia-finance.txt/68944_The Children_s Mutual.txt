## History

The organisation behind The Children's Mutual brand has a long history. Established in 1881, what later became the Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society (TWEFS), was formed to provide a scheme for working people to help protect them against loss of income during illness and build up a lump sum for their old age.

When the National Insurance Bill was launched in 1911, The company were one of the friendly societies chosen to help the Government administer the new state scheme.

Over time, The Company expanded into other areas of financial services, especially long-term savings for children, which increasingly became their specialism. In 2003 TWEFS re-launched as The Children's Mutual to recognise this specialist positioning and to prepare for the launch of the Government's new Child Trust Fund (CTF) scheme.

In April 2013, The Children's Mutual and The Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society transferred their engagements to Forester Life, following a member vote at the Special General Meeting in February.
