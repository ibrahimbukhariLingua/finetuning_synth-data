Shaheen Air


# Shaheen Air



**Shaheen Air International** (Urdu: شاہین ایئر) was a private Pakistani airline with its head office at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi and was founded by the Shah family. It remained Pakistan's second-largest airline until its liquidation in 2018 due to financial troubles. The airline owed Rs. 1.36 billion to Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan (CAA) and its employees salaries.

It provided passenger, cargo and charter services, to major cities in Pakistan and the Middle East. It suspended all operations in October 2018.


## History

Shaheen Air International was founded in 1993 by Shaheen Foundation. Shaheen Air Cargo was a division of Shaheen Air International that was established in 1993, soon after the inception of the airline. Shaheen Air provided special services for sending small time-sensitive consignments. The airline's early operations were fraught with difficulties, exacerbated by a 50 percent fare discount for retired and serving military officers and high operating costs due to a limited number of aircraft on wet lease.

The airline faced financial challenges, losing Rs 60 million between December 1999 and May 2000, in addition to owing Rs 70 million to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan for services during the same period.

On 22 May 2004, the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan (CAA) grounded Shaheen Air as the airline owed it millions of rupees. Three days later the airline was cleared by the CAA to resume its domestic and international operations. The clearance letter was issued by CAA following receipt of a payment from Shaheen Air International towards the outstanding dues and funds. The same year, Shaheen Air International (SAI) became Shaheen Air and the airline introduced a new livery and corporate website.

Shaheen Air started its own maintenance repair organization (MRO) by the name of *Shaheen Engineering and Aircraft Maintenance Services* (SEAMS) to provide maintenance services to Shaheen Air as well as other regional and international airlines.

In its international operations, Shaheen Air operated between Pakistan and numerous destinations in the Middle East. Shaheen Air once started flight operations to Riyadh with three different routes from Pakistan.

Shaheen Air was Pakistan's second-largest airline next to the flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines but due to the downturn in 2018, the airline declined. The airline was declared a defaulter by PCAA and FBR. In October 2018, SAI flight operations were completely suspended by the local regularity body PCAA and the airline declared a financial defaulter. Since November 2018, all SAI offices have closed.


### Investor Rumor and Liquidation

Shaheen reported an un-named investor from Saudi Arabia was to help the airline return to service from January 2019.

Even after repeated protests by the 5,000 employees, who were still owed months of wages, as of February 2019 no investigation into the matter had been initiated by any of the agencies, including the Federal Board of Revenue, Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Ministry of Aviation.

## Fleet

Two Airbus A320-200 remain in storage. The rest of the aircraft were leased and were returned to the lessors after the airline ceased operations. Pakistani law requires a passenger airline to have a minimum of three aircraft in its fleet, and Shaheen's fleet of two stored aircraft does not fulfil the mandatory requirement of the license to operate. Many of the old derelict planes of Shaheen Air are abandoned at Jinnah International Airport. On 26 January 2020, one of these planes, a Boeing 737-200, registered as AP-BIS, was destroyed by fire. 2 Ex Shaheen Air A330s are operated by SereneAir.
