# Zalman



**Zalman Tech Co.** (usually simplified as **ZALMAN**) is a South Korean software engineering company manufacturing aftermarket desktop computer products focusing on cooling enhancement.

Zalman has done product development since its founding in January 1999 and now holds several patents primarily on both cooling and fan noise reduction. Personal computer systems can generate significant heat and noise, the management of which is important for those modifying or assembling computer systems. Zalman's product range includes heat sink and fan solutions for CPUs, as well as quiet power supplies, computer water cooling systems, motherboard chipset coolers, graphics card heatsink and fan combos, laptop coolers, cases, and hard disk cases that lower temperature and reduce noise.

Zalman's primary competitors include Antec, Thermaltake, Spire, Cooler Master, and Arctic.

Zalman has also developed a fanless case. It uses a fin-based design to dissipate heat with heat-generating components like the graphics card and motherboard transferring heat to the case body via a system of heat pipes and radiators.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Zalman introduced the CNPS9500AM2, a heatsink meant specifically for socket AM2 compatibility on May 23, 2006. The company also broke into the headphone market with its 5.1 headphone system, ZM-RS6F/M.


## Monitors

Zalman has also sold stereoscopic (three-dimensional) LCD monitors, which utilize +45°/+45° polarized 3D glasses. These products allow the user to play games and other 3D media in full 3D stereoscopy (but with a 50% drop in vertical resolution per frame since only every second line is visible to each eye). Its 3D driver requires the native vertical resolution.

## Financial issues

On 30 October 2014, Zalman defaulted on a large loan amounting to over 3 billion won (approximately 3 million US dollars at time of default). Following this, the company applied for "initiation of corporate turnaround process" in an attempt to return itself to solvency. Tom's Hardware later reported that Zalman's financial difficulties were the result of fraud from Zalman's parent company, Moneual; Zalman restructured and was forced to lay off 2/3 of its workforce, but was beginning to recover by the end of 2015.
