Indian Trade Service


# Indian Trade Service



The **Indian Trade Service** (ITdS) is a civil service under Group A of the Central Civil Services of the executive branch of the Government of India. It was created as a specialized cadre to handle India's international trade and commerce on the basis of the recommendations of the Mathur Committee (Study Team on the Import and Export Trade Control Organization headed by Sri H.C. Mathur, Member of Parliament) in 1965.
At present, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, is the cadre controlling authority of the ITS. DGFT has 38 regional offices across India, and plays a significant role in promoting India's international trade with its policy formulation and implementation.

The Department of Commerce is headed by a Secretary who is assisted by a Special Secretary & Financial Adviser, three Additional Secretaries, thirteen Joint Secretaries and Joint Secretary level officers and a number of other senior officers. Keeping in view the large increase in workload in matters related to World Trade Organization (WTO), Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), free trade agreements (FTAs), Special Economic Zones (SEZs), joint study groups (JSGs) etc., two posts each of Joint Secretaries and Directors were created in the department during 2008–09.

The department is functionally organized into the following nine Divisions:

1. International Trade Policy Division
2. Foreign Trade Territorial Division
3. Export Products Division
4. Export Industries Division
5. Export Services Division
6. Economic Division
7. Administration & General Service Division
8. Finance Division
9. Supply Division

## Recruitment

The recruitment to Indian Trade Service is through Civil Services examinations conducted by UPSC. In addition, departmental candidates are also promoted as ITS through career progression.


## Role of Indian Trade Service

The main role of ITS officers can be divided into five parts:

1. Policy formulation in the area of International trade
2. Trade Policy implementation
3. Export promotion through various initiatives
4. International trade negotiations and commercial diplomacy
5. Miscellaneous and allied responsibilities

### Policy formulation

ITS officers contribute to the making of International Trade Policy formulation for India. India's foreign trade policy (FTP) is a five-year policy document, revised midway after two and half years. The current foreign trade policy in effect is the FTP 2015–20. The foreign trade policy of India is a single document that strives to provide a stable and sustainable policy environment for foreign trade in both merchandise and services. It aims to help various sectors of Indian economy to gain global competitiveness.

Indian Trade Service officers are involved in formulation and drafting of the policy. They also provide key inputs from the field offices regarding international trade matters which is subsequently taken up for review while making of the policy.

Apart from making the trade policy for the country, ITS officers also involve themselves in coordinating with various other ministries for taking stands on trade matters at international forums such as World Trade Organisation. For this purpose, there is a WTO cell at the Directorate General of foreign Trade. In addition, coordination for board of trade for inter state and central government consultation in the area of international trade policy formulation is also managed by ITS officers.

There has been a study by Frost and Sullivan recently where it has been recommended that role of ITS officers may be increased further in the area of policy formulation in coming future.
