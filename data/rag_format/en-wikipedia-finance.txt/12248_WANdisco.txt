# WANdisco



**WANdisco, plc.** develops technology that moves large Internet of Things (IoT) datasets, edge data, and Hadoop. The company is dual-headquartered in Sheffield, England and San Ramon, California.


## History

The name WANdisco is an acronym for wide-area network distributed computing. WANdisco was co-founded in 2005 by David Richards and Dr. Yeturu Aahlad. They grew the company without raising any private equity, venture capital, or angel funding and led it to a successful IPO on the London Stock Exchange on June 1, 2012.

In 2012, WANdisco acquired AltoStor and entered the big data market with its non-stop Hadoop product.

On March 9, 2023, the company's shares were suspended from trading in London, citing “significant, sophisticated and potentially fraudulent irregularities with regard to received purchase orders and related revenue and bookings, as represented by one senior sales employee”.

On July 25, 2023, the company's shares were readmitted to The London Stock Exchange. The company also announced that Stephen Kelly had become chief executive, having served as interim chief executive since 10 May 2023.


## Name Change

At the company's Annual General Meeting on 30 August 2023, shareholders voted in favor of the name change to Cirata PLC. It is expected that the transition of the Company name and ticker be completed by early October 2023, with the Company's shares to trade under the ticker "CRTA".
