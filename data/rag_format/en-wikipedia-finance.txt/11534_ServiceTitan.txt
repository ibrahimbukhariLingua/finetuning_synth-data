## History

ServiceTitan was founded by Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan in 2007; their cloud-based platform launched in 2012.

In 2019, the company expanded outside the United States, opening an office in Yerevan, Armenia.

In 2021, the company acquired Aspire Software, a company specializing in software for landscapers, and ServicePro, a company specializing in software for pest control and lawn care contractors.

ServiceTitan was planning an initial public offering for 2022 before the market for them soured, but continued to work with investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to prepare for a stock market listing in 2024. Following the 2024 United States presidential election, ServiceTitan filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior to the IPO, the company raised $1.4 billion in eight rounds of funding from investors, including Iconiq Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, TPG Inc. and Index Ventures.
