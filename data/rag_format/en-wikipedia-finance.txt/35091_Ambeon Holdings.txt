## History


### Colonial origin and post-independence Browns subsidiary

John Walker, a Scottish engineer who established Walker Sons and Company is the founder of the company. In 1874, Walker established Walker and Greig in Badulla and Haldumulla to supply agricultural machinery to the plantations in those areas. With the growing importance of Haputale, the Haldumulla shop was closed, and a new shop opened in Haputale. The headquarters of Walker and Greig was moved to Slave Island, Colombo later. The Colombo headquarters extended over five acres. The company was incorporated as a limited liability company in 1910. Walker and Greig Company was brought under Brown and Company in 1959. The company was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange on 1 January 1970.

In the same year, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe into Environmental Ressources Investments for stock manipulation. A platinum mine in South Africa bought by a subsidiary incorporated in the British Virgin Islands was the cause of the investigation. Despite the company selling the platinum mine at a capital gain, the investigation continued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Each of the directors of the company was charged with an LKR3.3 million fine for document falsification and non-disclosure.
