**Clarivate Plc** is a British-American publicly traded analytics company that operates a collection of subscription-based services, in the areas of bibliometrics and scientometrics; business / market intelligence, and competitive profiling for pharmacy and biotech, patents, and regulatory compliance; trademark protection, and domain and brand protection. In the academy and the scientific community, Clarivate is known for being the company that calculates the impact factor, using data from its Web of Science product family, that also includes services/applications such as Publons, EndNote, and EndNote Click. Its other product families are Cortellis, DRG, CPA Global, Derwent, CompuMark, and Darts-ip, and also the various ProQuest products and services.

Clarivate was formed in 2016, following the acquisition of Thomson Reuters' Intellectual Property and Science business by Onex Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia. Clarivate has acquired various companies since then, including, notably, ProQuest in 2021.


## Company history

Clarivate was formerly the Intellectual Property and Science division of Thomson Reuters. Before 2008, it was known as Thomson Scientific. In 2016, Thomson Reuters struck a $3.55 billion deal in which they spun it off as an independent company, and sold it to private-equity firms Onex Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia.

In May 2019, Clarivate merged with the Churchill Capital Corp SPAC to obtain a public listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) It currently trades with symbol NYSE:CLVT.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on March 11, 2022, Clarivate, which has an office in Odesa, Ukraine announced that it would cease all commercial activity in Russia.


### Operations

As of 2023, the company conducts operations through three strategic business units: Intellectual Property Group, Life Sciences & Healthcare Group, and Academic and Government Group, each led by a president.

Clarivate has been criticized for its anti-competitive practices in a highly oligopolistic academic database market, for increasing the prices of the products it acquired, for the lack of further development and integration of the acquired products, for not developing its own products, for outsourcing jobs from the US and UK to India, and for eliminating telephone support for many of the acquired products.


### Leadership Changes

On July 11, 2022, Clarivate announced that Jerre Stead would retire from his role as Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer to become Non-Executive Chair of the Board of Directors. On September 1, 2022, Jonathan Gear, previously Chief Financial Officer of IHS Markit, joined Clarivate on July 11, 2022, as CEO-elect, and became Chief Executive Officer on September 1, 2022.

On September 1, 2022, Clarivate announced that Jerre Stead would retire from the Board on October 20, 2022, at which date Andrew Snyder, CEO of Cambridge Information Group and Vice Chairman of Clarivate, became the new Chair effective from that date. The Board has appointed Stead as Chairman Emeritus upon his Board retirement. On August 6, 2024, Clarivate appointed former ProQuest CEO Matti Shem Tov as the Company's next CEO.
