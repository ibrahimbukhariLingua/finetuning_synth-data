Adam Smith Society


# Adam Smith Society



The **Adam Smith Society** is a chapter-based association of business school students and professionals named after the 18th-century economist, Adam Smith, and established by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in 2011, to promote discussion about the moral, social, and economic benefits of capitalism. The Adam Smith Society has been described as having been formed "to achieve in business schools what the Federalist Society achieved in law schools, exposing students to the philosophical and moral underpinnings of capitalism", and has been compared with the Benjamin Rush Society in medical schools and the Alexander Hamilton Society in foreign policy education, based on the fact that "all three groups subscribe to principles of individual liberty, limited government, and free markets".

The Society hosts events on public policy, business, entrepreneurship and technology with scholars, experts, and business leaders from across the ideological spectrum. Events have focused on technology, free trade, entrepreneurship, and the works of Adam Smith. In addition to chapter-based lectures, debates, and dinners, the Adam Smith Society has an annual meeting and leadership retreat in New York City; destination-based treks for members to learn about a particular subject; and one-off events, such as case competitions.


## History

In late 2010, the Manhattan Institute partnered with the Marilyn G. Fedak Capitalism Project to establish the Adam Smith Society at elite U.S. business schools, with a goal to create a new organization to:

> ...provide future business leaders with access to contemporary thought leaders who were at the forefront of understanding and promoting the market economy, while giving young men and women the tools they needed to promote a positive and thoughtful understanding of the free market system on their campuses.

Since 2011, the Adam Smith Society has expanded to more than 30 chapters at MBA schools, as well as professional chapters in major cities. In 2014, the Adam Smith Society collaborated with Encounter Books and James R. Otteson to publish an anthology of writings by Adam Smith and other important economic thinkers titled *What Adam Smith Knew*. In fall 2017, the Society launched their first international professional chapter in London, United Kingdom. The Society's first international student chapter was founded at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel in May 2018.

The Adam Smith Society is not directly related to the 19th century Adam Smith Society promoted by Italian economist and proponent of capitalism Francesco Ferrara, and to the International Adam Smith Society established in 1995, although it has some interests in common with each of these, and all share the same namesake.
