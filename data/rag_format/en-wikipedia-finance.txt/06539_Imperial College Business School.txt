## History

In 1851, the Great Exhibition, the first World's Fair, was organised by Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. The proceeds from this event were used to establish museums and royal colleges in South Kensington, to become a centre for science, culture, and industry.

In 1907, Imperial College London was established by Royal Charter, unifying the Royal College of Science, Royal School of Mines, and City and Guilds of London Institute into one university.

In 1909, King Edward VII laid the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building, which is part of the present-day Business School facilities.

In 1955, Imperial's first MSc in Production Engineering and Management was launched at 14 Prince's Gate. In 1961, Imperial launched an MSc in Operational Research and Management Studies. In 1964, executive education short courses were first given in Operational Research.

In 1965, Imperial College London and the London School of Economics co-sponsor the founding of the London Business School. The Rector of Imperial and Director of LSE joined the governing body, guiding the establishment of LBS.

In 1971, a Department of Management Science was created, followed by the establishment of the Department of Social & Economic Studies in 1978.

In 1987, the Departments of Management Science and Social & Economic Studies merged to form a Management School at 53 Prince's Gate.

In 1989, an Executive MBA was launched. In 2001, an Entrepreneurship Centre was established. In 2002, a Distance Learning MBA was introduced. In 2003, an Innovation and Entrepreneurial group was established.

In 2003, the school is elevated to Faculty status, alongside the Faculties of Natural Science, Medicine and Engineering. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of York officially opened the business school.

In 2021, Imperial's White City Campus opened, whose operations are focused around innovation, entrepreneurship, and multidisciplinary research.
