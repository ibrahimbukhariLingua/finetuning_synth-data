## Work

Mueller is a past president of the Public Choice Society, the Southern Economic Association, the Industrial Organization Society, and EARIE. His main research interests are in public choice and industrial economics. His work is mainly about high-ranking people taking advantage of informational transaction costs. Governments pursue their agenda of enlarging to inefficient sizes in the name of public interest at the expense of actual owners, citizens, and taxpayers. Corporate managers pursue their agenda of unnecessarily making companies large and efficient at the cost of the actual owners, as well as stockholders.

On the public choice approach, he said, "Public choice approach is the economic study of non-market decision making or an application of economics to political science and the politico-administrative process of collective decision making."
