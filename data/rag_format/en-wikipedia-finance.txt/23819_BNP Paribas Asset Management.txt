BNP Paribas Asset Management


# BNP Paribas Asset Management



**BNP Paribas Asset Management** is the dedicated, autonomous asset management business of BNP Paribas Group.


## History

In 2007, BNP Paribas regrouped its function in asset management under the brand name BNP Paribas Investment Partners.

In 2010, the closing of the transaction between BNP Paribas Investment Partners and Fortis Investments was completed.

In June 2017, BNP Paribas Investment Partners rebrands as BNP Paribas Asset Management.

In August 2024, BNP Paribas Asset Management entered exclusive talks with Axa for the acquisition of Axa Investment Managers for €5.1bn. As Axa Investment Managers has €850bn of assets under management, the deal would create one of the largest asset management firm in Europe, with around €1.5tn of assets under management. On 21 December 2014, Axa and BNP Paribas signed the purchase agreement of Axa Investment Managers by Cardif (BNP Paribas' insurance company). By using its insurance company for completing the purchase, BNP Paribas aims at benefiting from the "Danish compromise" (an EU rule that reduce the costs of owning a bank for an insurer relatively to a bank, in terms of risk-weighted assets and therefore of capital ratio).
