Ministry of Finance (Denmark)


# Ministry of Finance (Denmark)



The **Ministry of Finance of Denmark** (Danish: *Finansministeriet*) is a ministry in the Government of Denmark. Among other things, it is in charge of the government budget (subject to approval by the Danish parliament, *Folketinget*), paying government employees and improving efficiency in government administration. The current Finance Minister of Denmark is Nicolai Wammen.


## History

In 1848 King Frederik VII converted the nation's government to a constitutional monarchy, and its old administrative system was converted into a ministerial system. As a result, the Ministry of Finance was established on 24 November 1848. At the time, it was the largest of the government's ministries. The new ministry was immediately tasked with creating the first annual state budget proposal to be voted on by the Rigsdagen. The project was overseen by Minister Wilhelm Sponneck, who was 33 years-old at the time he was appointed.

As the amount of money going into the state budget has increased, the ministry has expanded to manage it. In 1968, the Ministry of Finance was split into the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of State payroll and pension services. The latter was repealed on 11 October 1971, and the area was transferred to the newly created Budget Ministry, which from 1973 was again placed under the Ministry of Finance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
