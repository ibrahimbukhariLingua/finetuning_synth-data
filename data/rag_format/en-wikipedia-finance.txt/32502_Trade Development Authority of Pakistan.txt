# Trade Development Authority of Pakistan



The **Trade Development Authority of Pakistan** (**TDAP**) (Urdu: مقتدرہ ترقی تجارت پاکستان), is an organisation under the Ministry of Commerce and Textile Industry of the Government of Pakistan. It facilitates and promotes international trade of Pakistan. The current Chief Executive of TDAP is Mr. Muhammad Zubair Motiwala.


## Background

The department was established on 8 November 2006 under a Presidential Ordinance, as a successor organization to the *Export Promotion Bureau*, which was established in 1963. The TDAP is mandated to have a larger view of global trade development, rather than only the export promotion - together with its 14 regional offices, the department performs facilitation and regulatory functions as well as providing supply side and marketing assistance to exporters. It arranges *awareness seminars and workshops* to educate the Pakistani business community about the latest conditions and trends in the global markets.


## Exports and trade shows

In 2011, Pakistan's exports of stones, marble, granites to China doubled due to effective marketing strategies developed by TDAP.

On a regular basis, TDAP facilitates and encourages Pakistani business community to exhibit their products at all major trade shows in Pakistan including at Karachi Expo Centre and Lahore Expo Center.


## E-commerce

In 2017, Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) signed a 'Memorandum of Understanding' with the China-based Alibaba Group to promote exports through e-commerce.
