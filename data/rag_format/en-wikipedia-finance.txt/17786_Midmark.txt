## History

Midmark, formerly The Cummings Machine Company, was founded in 1915, manufacturing cement mixers. In 1918, Cummings bought the Reeves Pulley Company's engine business. In 1919, the company expanded its product line to mining locomotives, foundry equipment, and custom metal fabrications, and became the Industrial Equipment Company. John Eiting was the first member of the Eiting family to hold a leadership position, being named president in 1925. John's son, Carl Eiting joined the company in 1930 and became president in 1953.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Carl's son, Jim Eiting, joined the company in 1956.

Midmark entered the medical industry in 1967 when it purchased the assets of the bankrupt American Metal Furniture Company. The company was then renamed IE Industries for "innovative engineering".

It also introduced a solid-frame hydrostatic trencher for cutting ditches for utility underground lines and general construction. These new product lines resulted in the creation of three product divisions: Midmark Medical, Midmark Power (trencher), and Midmark Steel (mining equipment and custom manufacturing). In 1978, IE Industries became Midmark Corporation.
