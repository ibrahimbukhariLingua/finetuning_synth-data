Selfridges Group


# Selfridges Group



**Selfridges Group** was a holding company of European department stores. At the time of its acquisition by the Central Group and Signa Holding in 2022, it owned the full-line stores Arnotts and Brown Thomas in Ireland, De Bijenkorf in the Netherlands, and Selfridges in the United Kingdom. The company previously owned the Canadian department stores Holt Renfrew and Ogilvy, both of which the Weston family retained in the acquisition.

Signa Holdings' 40-percent stake in the acquisition was acquired by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund in 2024. The acquired stores are controlled by the department store division of Central Group, which is the majority owner with 60 percent, however the Selfridges Group name is occasionally used to reference the four stores collectively.


## History

Selfridges Group, along with KaDeWe Group, is owned by the Central Group from Thailand, which acquired it in 2021 jointly with Austria-based Signa Holding, which lost joint control in late 2023. Shareholders successfully ousted Signa Holding's founder, Ren√© Benko, who was pressured to relinquish his voting rights amid the financial turmoil.
