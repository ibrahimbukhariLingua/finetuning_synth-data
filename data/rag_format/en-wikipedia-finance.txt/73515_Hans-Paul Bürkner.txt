## Career

He was a member of the teams which opened BCG's Düsseldorf and Frankfurt offices, in 1982 and 1991 respectively.

Under his leadership, BCG had grown from 4,500 employees to more than 15,000, and he had overseen the opening of twenty new offices around the world, doubling the size of the firm's partner group. Upon the completion of his final term, Bürkner began as Chairman of BCG. The firm's partners elected Rich Lesser to begin a three-year term effective January 1, 2013.

Bürkner has studied economics, business administration, and Chinese. He has received a diploma from the University of Bochum, an M.A. from Yale University, and a D.Phil. from St. Catherine's College, University of Oxford between 1976 and 1980, where he was a Rhodes Scholar.
