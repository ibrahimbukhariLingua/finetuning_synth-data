Mack Trucks


# Mack Trucks



**Mack Trucks, Inc.** is an American truck manufacturing company and a former manufacturer of buses and trolley buses. Founded in 1900 as the **Mack Brothers Company**, it manufactured its first truck in 1905 and adopted its present name in 1922. Since 2000, Mack Trucks has been a subsidiary of Volvo, which purchased Mack and its former parent company Renault Véhicules Industriels.

Founded originally in Brooklyn in 1900, the company moved its headquarters to Allentown, Pennsylvania, five years later, in 1905. The company remained in Allentown for over a century, from 1905 until 2009. In 2009, the company relocated its headquarters to Greensboro, North Carolina.

Mack products are produced in Lower Macungie, Pennsylvania, and Salem, Virginia. Its powertrain products are produced in its Hagerstown, Maryland, plant. Mack also maintains additional assembly plants in facilities in Pennsylvania, Australia, and Venezuela. The company also once maintained plants in Winnsboro, South Carolina, Hayward, California, and Oakville, Ontario, which are now closed.


## Operations

The company's manufacturing facilities are located at their Lehigh Valley Operations facility and division, formally known as the Macungie Assembly Operations Plant, in Macungie, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of the state. Mack Trucks is the fourth-largest employer in the Lehigh Valley region as of 2024.

Mack Trucks is one of the top producers in the vocational and on-road vehicle market, class 8 through class 13.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Mack trucks have been sold in 45 countries. Located near its former Allentown corporate headquarters in Macungie, Pennsylvania, the company's manufacturing plant produces all Mack products, including Mack MP-series enginesᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.

Mack transmissions, TC-15 transfer cases, and rear engine power take-offs are designed and manufactured in Hagerstown, Maryland, which was the original factory location.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Parts for Mack's right-hand-drive vehicles are produced in Brisbane, Australia for worldwide distribution. Assembly for South America is performed in Macungie alongside the North American trucks. Mack no longer operates Mack de Venezuela C.A., in Caracas, Venezuela. The former Venezuela operation is a complete knock down (CKD) facility. Components were shipped from the United States to Caracas for final assembly.

In addition to its Macungie manufacturing facility, Mack also has a remanufacturing center in Middletown, Pennsylvania.


### 2008 restructuring plan

On August 14, 2008, Mack Trucks announced a major restructuring plan that included:

* Relocation of Mack's head office, product development, most support functions, and purchasing functions to Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2009. Mack's parent, Volvo Trucks, already has its North American base in Greensboro.
* Assembly of all produced Mack highway vehicles in Macungie, Pennsylvania, starting 2008
* Mack's testing facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania being converted into a "customer demonstration and reception center" in 2010
* Restructuring the parts distribution network by 2010 (later delayed to first quarter 2011)

### Fire apparatus products

Mack Trucks built complete fire apparatus in Allentown from 1911 until 1984. In addition to building pumpers, Mack also offered aerial trucks using ladder assemblies supplied by other manufacturers, notably American LaFrance and Canadian builder Pierre Thibault. Many still serve with fire departments around the world.

In the 1970s, Mack started selling their chassis to other fire apparatus manufacturers. Production of Mack-chassised fire trucks continues for use in fire departments throughout North America and around the world.

### Previous models


#### AC

The heavy-duty AC, with its well-known tapered hood, was the truck which started the bulldog theme. A 377 cu in (6.2 L) 4 cylinder gasoline engine 4X2 with chain drive, it was strong, reliable, and worked well in rough terrain. Introduced in 1916, there was a great demand because of World War I, over 6000 3+1⁄2-, 5+1⁄2-, and 7+1⁄2-ton trucks were built for the UK and US military. There were also commercial sales from 1916; the AC was well suited for logging and construction work. A larger version, the AP, built between 1926 and 1938, was an off-road haul truck used on Boulder Dam and other large projects. 40,299 ACs had been built when production ended in 1939.


#### N Series

The N Series was Mack's first military design, large 6 and 7+1⁄2-ton 6X6 artillery prime movers. Between its development in the late 1930s and the beginning of production in 1940 US military requirements changed and the truck was not needed. All NMs and most of the larger NOs were exported as foreign aid. After World War II the NO was developed into the successful M 123 semi-tractor.


#### B series

The Mack B series models were Mack's primary vehicle from its introduction in 1953 until it was replaced by the R Series in 1966. They ranged in size from the medium duty B20P gas powered 4X2 to the oversized B873SX turbo-diesel 6X6. B Models were commonly used as semi tractors and in the construction industry. They were also used as fire engines and trucks, sometimes with the roof of the cab removed. 127,786 B Models were built.


#### R/RB/RD/RL/RM/RW, U, DM/DMM series

Mack started to produce the Mack R series (R, RW, and U models) in 1966 for highway use, and the RD, DM, and all wheel drive RM and DMM models for construction use. The lightweight RL model followed in 1967, the RW Superliner with a large, rectangular hood and grill in 1977, and the setback front axle RB in the 1990s. All these models featured the same cab; the U, DM, and DMM had the cab offset to the left.

In the 1990s, the R, RW, and U series models were discontinued and the RB was introduced, mostly for severe-duty applications. The hood was modified slightly for the model RB. 2004 was the last year for the RD, and 2006 for the RB and DM. The DM was the last model to use this cab style, and was the last model of this family to be produced.

As a replacement for the construction models, Mack started to offer the Granite, Granite Bridge-Formula and Granite Axle-back.

Also this model is serving in the Mexican Army as a Troop and Utility Truck in configuration 6X6 OR 6X4


### Engines

By 1916 Mack was producing 4- and 6-cylinder gasoline engines, and through 2014 continued to offer their own, in the form of three diesel I6s. Engines by other manufacturers were often optional, supplied over the years by Caterpillar, Cummins, Chrysler, Detroit Diesel, Hercules, Scania, and Waukesha.

Mack started making diesels in 1938, in 1957 the END and turbocharged ENDT 673 diesel were introduced. This 672 cu in (11.0 L) I6 engine family was successful, and remained in production for over 30 years.

In the early 1960s, Walter May, executive vice president of product and engineering at Mack Trucks HQ in Allentown, PA., prioritized research and development of a high-torque rise engine. Winton Pelizzoni, chief engineer at the Mack Trucks powertrain facility in Hagerstown, MD., designed an innovative engine based on this concept and then led development of the prototype that went into production. The engine was introduced as an inline six in 1966, as a V8 in 1970, and as the intercooled inline six 300 series in 1973. This was an industry-changing event. The Maxidyne, with an operating range of 1200–2100 R.P.M, and later 1050–1700 R.P.M., allowed a heavy Class 8 truck to be operated with a 5 speed (Maxitorque) transmission. Previously, heavy trucks typically operated between 1800–2100R.P.M. and were equipped with 10 or more gears.

In 2014 Mack offers three engine series, the 11 L MP 7, 13 L MP8, and 16 L MP10, with 325 hp (242 kW) to 605 hp (451 kW) and 1,200 lb⋅ft (1,627 N⋅m) to 2,060 lb⋅ft (2,793 N⋅m).


### Other products

Mack also produced railroad cars and locomotives between 1905 and 1930. The company additionally produced several railbus models.


## Trademark

The company's trademark is the bulldog, which can be found on the front of almost all Mack trucks. A gold-plated bulldog indicates the truck came with all Mack drivetrain including the engine, transmission and axles.

Mack trucks earned their nickname during World War I, when the British government purchased the Mack AC for supplying its front lines. Its pugnacious, blunt-nosed hood, tenacious performance, and durability, reminded the soldiers of their country's mascot, the British Bulldog.
The logo was first used in 1921 for the AB chain drive models and became the official corporate logo in 1922.

## Military models


### World War II

Mack built over 35,000 heavy duty military trucks during World War II, most for export under Lend-Lease. None were US Army standard types, all were designed and built exclusively by Mack.

The EH series was a commercial design 5 ton (4,500 kg) 4x2 adapted for military service. The EH, EHU (cabover) and semi-tractor models EHT and EHUT were used by the US Army in Europe. Over 2,400 were built in 1942.

The **LMSW** was a commercial design 10 ton (9,070 kg) 6x4 chassis adapted for military wreckers, most were exported to Great Britain.

The **NJU** (G-639) series were military design 5 ton (5,450 kg) 4x4 semi-tractors used to tow bridging pontoons and equipment. Several other manufactures built standardized models of similar trucks, so only 700 were produced in 1941–1942.

The NM (G-535) and NO (G-532) series were military design 6 ton (5,443 kg) and 7+1⁄2 ton (6,800 kg) 6x6 artillery prime movers. All NMs and most of the larger NOs were exported as foreign aid. Over 8,400 NMs and 2,000 NOs were built between 1940 and 1944.

The **NR** series were military design 10 ton (5,440 kg) 6x4 cargo trucks. Intended for British use in North Africa, they had Mack ED diesel engines, making them valuable for long-distance trips. Over 15,000 were built between 1940 and 1944.


### Post World War II

Since World War II, Mack has had limited military production.

The M39 (G-744) series, which includes the M54 cargo truck, were a standardized military design 5 ton (4,540 kg) 6x6 chassis, with many models. Mack developed a competing design, when the M39 was standardized Mack built a relatively small number of M51 dump trucks. In the early 1960s they took part in a short lived program to retrofit some of the series with Mack END 672 engines.

The M123 and M125 (G-792) were standardized military design 10 ton (9,070 kg) 6x6 semi tractors and artillery prime movers. Designed by Mack, using many components from the NO series. Mack built 392 M123s, used with a lowboy trailer to recover and transport tanks, and all 552 M125s, between 1955 and 1957. Later follow-up orders called for 420 M123s and retrofitted 210 more with Cummins engines.
