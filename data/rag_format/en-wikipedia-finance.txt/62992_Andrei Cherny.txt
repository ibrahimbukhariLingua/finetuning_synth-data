## Early life and education

Cherny was born in Los Angeles, on August 4, 1975. His parents, Helena and Pavel, were Czechoslovak Jewish immigrants who initially spoke little English.

Aspiration aimed to sell carbon offsets and credits to businesses. Under Cherny's leadership, Aspiration created cash management accounts that ensured customers' deposits were with banks that did not lend to fossil fuel companies. By 2021, it was reported to have over 5 million customers. In June 2021, Cherny wrote a commentary in Fortune explaining his decision to raise his company's minimum wage to $25/hour.


### Aspiration investigation

The company is being investigated for potential misconduct related to carbon credit transactions.

In January 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission initiated a probe into whether Aspiration "misled customers about the quality of the carbon offsets it was selling". *Bloomberg* reported that authorities were reviewing Cherny's actions as part of the investigation. Cherny, who retains financial interests in the company, said in a statement that he will cooperate, saying, "The carbon removal credit industry is an emerging industry and deserves to be regulated and scrutinized to ensure it is as effective as possible".
