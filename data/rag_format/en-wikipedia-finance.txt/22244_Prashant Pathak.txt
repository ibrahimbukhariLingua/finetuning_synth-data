He suggested that, to understand the global Indians, one should study (1.) monarch butterfly (multi-generation round trip between South and North America), (2.) blue wildebeest (survival of blue wildebeest over the black wildebeest that nearly were extinct), and the (3.) bees (how they are essential for existence of human life by being the pollination agent for plants).
