## History

Development Bank of Rwanda (BRD), is a Public Company Limited by Shares, with a share capital of RWF 57,808,931,000, registered at the Officer of the Registrar General, whose company code n° 100003547.

The Bank was incorporated on August 5, 1967; however, its incorporation certificate was issued on 7/7/2011 while a banking license n°003 was issued by the National Bank of Rwanda on August 11, 2009.

For more than four decades, BRD has been the sole provider of long term finance and has significantly facilitated the emergence of different productive enterprises in the private sector.

**2000-2009: Growth and Innovation phase**

This phase ensues from the necessity for the Bank to contribute to the recapitalization and the monetization of the rural area, in the increase of the export against of challenges of the Rwandan Economy imposed by the needs of fast and long-lasting growth to fight poverty. In fact more than 90% of the population lives in the rural area and mainly on agriculture.

In order to enhance the Bank mission of development, in 2005 the Government of Rwanda mandated BRD with a mission to become the “Financier” of Rwanda’s development. Since then BRD has been transforming itself in order to be able to play its crucial role in Rwanda’s development. BRD 2005-2009 Strategic Operating Plan translates BRD mission and vision to become the most profitable bank at the service of poverty reduction.

**Post-Genocide phase:** After the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, there were catastrophic results that followed and the bank continues to shoulder a burden of more than 50% of its portfolio constituting non- performing loans consequential from the 1994 genocide.

An amount of loans totaling Rwf6.8 billion, 115 operations; Rwf6.7 billion in 112 lines of credit; Rwf156.4 million in equity shares in 3 productive ventures. The loans were mainly invested in modernization and rehabilitation of ventures to the tune of Rwf13.4 billions, creating an employment of 8,923 people and an added value to the economy of about Rwf8 billion.

The war paralyzed the rural areas and revitalization of the activities after 1994 concentrated in the capital city mainly in the secondary and tertiary sectors. This period was a reorganization and consolidation phase.

**1988-1994: Maturity phase**

During this period, the Bank disbursed loans totaling: Rwf4. 6 billion in 873 lines of credit; Rwf84.5 million in equity shares in 7 productive ventures. It generated an investment volume of Rwf15.7 billion with a creation of employment for 9,094 people and value added to the economy of Rwf8, 5 billion.

The priority areas for the loans were agro-industries mainly the sectors of tea and manufacturing, enabled by low cost financial resources available to small and medium scale enterprises in agribusiness; artisans and micro- projects

**1968-1987: Establishment and development phase**

During the years 1968 to 1970, the Bank was being established and no projects were financed.

In the four years that followed, the Bank recorded major loans on vehicles (pick-ups) and grinding mills. The financing of the vehicles extended all over the country and marked a crucial step towards improving accessibility of goods in the country.

Effective from 1974, the bank embarked on aggressive financing of different sectors of the economy.

An amount of loans totaling Rwf6.6 billion has since been extended to 501 operations, Rwf317 million invested in equity shares with 23 companies, and Rwf6.3 billion in loans to 478 borrowers. This meant an investment impact of about Rwf12.6 billion with a creation of employment opportunities for 8,400 people and cumulative added value of Rwf25.2 billion.

**The bank has financed about 80% of the country’s medium and long term loan portfolio in the productive ventures.**


## Acquisition

**MARCH - 2011**: **Merger of BAS and BDF**

Since March 2011, BRD Advisory Services (BAS Ltd) and BRD Development Fund (BDF Ltd) companies were merged to form a new company called BDF Ltd.

The new company remained subsidiary to BRD and streamlined the previous mission.
