### Hungary

In January 2025, the Hungarian government signed a contract to sell the area around the abandoned Rákosrendező railway station to Eagle Hills. The contract involved a development worth €12 billion, named Grand Budapest, or colloquially "Mini-Dubai". The development was to include a 500 m tall skyscraper, which is not allowed by the Budapest building code but was granted an exemption in the contract. The contract was condemned by Budapest mayor Gergely Karácsony as well as Dávid Vitézy. The government eventually abandoned the plan as one of the utility companies owned by Budapest had priority purchase rights to the area.
