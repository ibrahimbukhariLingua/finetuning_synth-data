# Nordic Aviation Capital



**Nordic Aviation Capital** (NAC) is a company specializing in regional aircraft leasing, including narrowbody aircraft. NAC is headquartered in Ireland, with offices in Singapore, Denmark, Dubai and Toronto. It has over 60 customers in over 40 countries.


## History

NAC was founded on October 15, 1990, in Denmark, focusing on turboprop leasing for its first 25 years.

From 2015 to 2020, it doubled its fleet principally by expanding into regional jets. By January 2020, the Company moved to a new headquarters in Ireland and its fleet value peaked at about $7 billion, with over 500 aircraft owned, managed, and committed. At this point, NAC was by far the worldâ€™s largest regional aircraft lessor.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lack of adequate equity and various portfolio issues, NAC underwent a major financial restructuring commencing in late 2021, including a chapter 11 filing. A new senior management team, ownership group and Board of Directors were then established.

The company emerged during June 2022 with a much improved balance sheet and financial position of over $500 million of liquidity and growth capital. The fleet total was over 370 aircraft owned, managed and on order, with assets of over $3 billion and significantly reduced debt.


## Franchise

NAC is currently the only lessor with both orders for new ATR turboprops and Airbus A220 cross-over jets. NAC also plans to expand into larger narrow body aircraft such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family members.


## Ownership

NAC is owned by a diversified group of institutional investors including leading insurance companies, asset managers and other financial institutions.


## Fleet

As of December 31, 2022 the Nordic Aviation Capital fleet consists of the following aircraft:
