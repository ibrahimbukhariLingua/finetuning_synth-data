Eurelectric


# Eurelectric



**Eurelectric** (full name: The Union of the Electricity Industry) is the sector association which represents the common interests of the electricity industry at a European level, plus its affiliates and associates on several other continents. Together these organisations employ 970,000 people in the European Union and have a turnover of €627 billion. Formally established in 1989, Eurelectric covers all major issues affecting the sector, from generation and markets to distribution networks and customer issues.

Eurelectric’s main objectives are the realisation of a carbon-neutral electricity mix in Europe well before mid-century and the development of energy efficiency and electrification to mitigate climate change.

Eurelectric hosts the Power Summit, an annual conference dedicated to European energy policy.


## Organizational structure

Eurelectric is led by a President and two Vice Presidents, who are elected to two-year terms, and a Board of Directors. The Secretary-General leads the Secretariat, which consists of several organisational units employing an international staff of approximately forty people. There are five professional committees and about twenty working groups.
Eurelectric is a signatory to the EU Transparency Register.


## Recognition

Eurelectric has attracted accolades for its engagement on climate files, with InfluenceMap, an independent think tank, saying in July 2021:

“Deeper research covering a group of 20 key industry associations’ recent engagement with the EU Commission’s Fit for 55 package shows that the power sector has evolved into a leading advocate of an ambitious European climate agenda, with **Eurelectric**, the utility sector’s primary representative at the EU level, supported by highly progressive, renewables-focused groups.”

It has also been recognised by its peers as a leading association winning the following awards:

* Best Data Visualisation, Lens Video Awards 2023
* Best Online Conference/Event, International & European Association Awards 2021
* Best Communications Campaign, International & European Association Awards 2020
