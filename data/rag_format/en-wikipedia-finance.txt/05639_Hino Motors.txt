# Hino Motors



**Hino Motors, Ltd.**, commonly known as **Hino**, is a Japanese manufacturer of commercial vehicles and diesel engines (including those for trucks, buses and other vehicles) headquartered in Hino, Tokyo. The company was established in 1942 as a corporate spin-off from previous manufacturers.

Hino Motors is a large constituent of the Nikkei 225 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It is a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation and one of 16 major companies of the Toyota Group.


## History


### Predecessors

Hino's predecessors trace back to the founding of Tokyo Gas Industry Company in 1910. In 1910, Chiyoda Gas Company was established and competed fiercely against incumbent Tokyo Gas Company for supplying natural gas to users. Tokyo Gas Industry was a parts supplier for Chiyoda Gas but it was defeated and merged into Tokyo Gas in 1912. Having lost its largest client, Tokyo Gas Industry Co. broadened its product line including electronic parts, and renamed itself as Tokyo Gas and Electric Industry (東京瓦斯電気工業), TG&E, and was often abbreviated as Gasuden. It produced its first motor vehicle in 1917, the Model TGE "A-Type" truck. In 1937, TG&E merged its automobile division with that of Automobile Industry Co., Ltd. and Kyodo Kokusan K.K., to form Tokyo Automobile Industry Co., Ltd., with TG&E as a shareholder. Four years later, the company changed its name to Diesel Motor Industry Co., Ltd., which would eventually become Isuzu.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Foundation of Hino and Post-World War II history

In 1942, a new company called Hino Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. was spun out from Diesel Motor Industry Co., Ltd. During World War II, Hino manufactured Type 1 Ho-Ha half-track and Type 1 Ho-Ki armored personnel carrier for the Imperial Japanese Army. Following treaties signed at the end of World War II, the company had to stop producing large diesel engines for marine applications, so the company dropped the "Heavy" from its name and formally concentrated on the heavy-duty trailer-truck, buses and diesel engines markets, as Hino Industry Co., Ltd. The company took its name from the location of its headquarters in Hino city (日野市, *Hino-shi*) within Tokyo prefecture.

In 1948, the company spun itself into two entities, Hino Diesel Industry Co., Ltd and Hino Diesel Sales. In 1950 the heavy-duty TH10 was introduced, equipped with an all-new 7-liter DS10 diesel engine. An eight-tonner, this was considerably larger than existing Japanese trucks which had rarely been built for more than 6,000 kg (13,230 lb) payload. In 1952, the company introduced the B10/30 (Blue Ribbon) on a European style forward control cabin, a first for Japanese manufacturers. In 1953, it rolled off the ZG heavy truck which became the most sold dump truck in Japan. That year, Hino entered the private car market, by manufacturing Renaults under licence, and in 1961 it started building its own Contessa 900 sedan with an 893cc rear-mounted engine, and a pickup truck called the Hino Briska with the Contessa engine slightly enlarged and installed in the front with rear wheel drive. The Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti redesigned the Contessa line in 1964 with a 1300 cc rear-mounted engine. Fed by two SU type carburettors, this developed 60 hp (44 kW) in the sedan 70 hp (51 kW) in the coupé version.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1959, the company adopted the Hino Motors, Ltd. name.

In 1963, the Hamura factory began operations.

Hino Trucks have also been assembled in Norway (1977–85), Portugal and Canada.


### Tieup with Toyota

Hino was in financial difficulties in the 1960s. In October 1966, following some pressure for industry consolidation from the Japanese government, Hino and Toyota signed a partnership agreement (through the Mitsui Bank) by which the former became an affiliate of the latter and focused itself on truck and bus production alongside vehicle assembly under contract. In April 1967, Hino began assembling light vehicles for Toyota, after an influx of employees from the latter to the former. The Hino Briska pickup was rebadged as the Toyota Briska and, in March 1968, the model was used to develop the Toyota HiLux which had more stock parts from Toyota. Hino also assembled the Publica van and sedan. Both companies started to collaborate in purchasing as well as research and development. Hino officially stopped assembling passenger cars in 1969, although continued assembling light vehicles for Toyota (as the Publica van and the HiAce). Up until the 1990s, Hino assembled the HiLux.

In the 1960s, Hino launched new medium and heavy duty trucks (TC300, KF). In March 1964, the company launched the medium duty KM series truck, later named the *Ranger*.

In the 1970s, Hino introduced the so-called "red" diesel engines with a focus on fuel efficiency and incorporating MAN technology. The company began to increase exports as it had an efficiency advantage compared to most foreign rivals at the time. By the end of the 1970s, export sales surpassed domestic ones. In 1977, Hino launched its first long range coach. In 1981, the company introduced the Profia, the first truck of a new series with improved aerodynamics, engines and cabin.

In the late 1970s, Hino started to form partnerships with other manufacturers besides Toyota. In 1978, it established a technical assistance agreement with Asia Motors. That same year, it established a partnership with the Chinese car manufacturer FAW by providing technical assistance on medium trucks to it, mostly for improving FAW's Jiefanghao (an outdated ZIS-150-based vehicle) range. In 1986, it started to license its engines to Ashok Leyland.

Starting in the 1990s, Hino returned to financial difficulties. The company introduced new heavy vehicles (trucks and coaches) and expanded its Asian business to try improving its profitability. Toyota also helped its affiliate by giving it assembly contracts (Toyota Tercel/Corsa, Toyota T100). In March 1997, Toyota increased its Hino stake (at the time 11.4%) to 16.4% and to 20.1% by the end of the year. Toyota also moved all its production and development activities for light trucks to Hino.

In June 1998, Toyota said it planned to take control of Hino. By March 2001, it had acquired a 36.6% Hino stake. Later that year, Hino became a subsidiary of Toyota after the latter increased its ownership to a 50.1% majority stake.

In 2002, Hino and Isuzu merged their bus/coach production and development facilities in Japan into a joint venture called J-Bus. In March of that year, Hino and Scania AB signed a partnership deal by which the former was to take charge of the Japanese sales of the latter. The deal also included the possibility of further technical and commercial collaboration. In December 2006, Scania started to sell Hino trucks in South Korea. In June 2011, Scania left the deal after it opened its own Japanese sales operation.

In 2012, Hino started to move medium and heavy truck production in Japan from its obsolete, cramped Hino plant to a new one in Koga, Ibaraki, which initially produced complete knock-down kits for export. The move was completed in September 2017, as part of a consolidation of the Japanese operations into three main plants: Koga would produce medium and heavy trucks; Nitta (Ota, Gunma), which had already been manufacturing engines for light and medium vehicles and opened a new plant for large ones completed in December 2016 to replace the Hino plant, engines and transmissions; Hamura, lighter trucks and contract assembly for Toyota.

In 2018, Hino and Volkswagen Truck and Bus (later renamed Traton) announced a wide-ranging strategic partnership for activities including procurement, technologies and logistics. In November 2019, they established a procurement joint venture called Hino and Traton Global Procurement, with 51% of it owned by Traton and 49% by Hino. By 2023, the partnership was terminated.

In March 2021, Hino, its parent Toyota, and Isuzu announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each. In August 2022, after Toyota published the findings of a self-commissioned investigation highlighting that Hino Motors falsified emissions data on some engines going back to at least October 2003, Toyota and Isuzu "expelled" Hino from their partnership. The Hino stake would be given to Toyota.

In May 2023, Hino and its parent Toyota signed a memorandum of understanding with Mitsubishi Fuso and its parent Daimler Truck for a plan of merging Hino and Mitsubishi Fuso into a publicly traded holding company with "equal investment" from both Toyota and Daimler Truck.

## Facilities


### Japan

Hino has four plants in Japan: Hino, Hamura, Nitta and Koga.

The Hino plant operates since the establishment of the company. Until 2016, it produced medium and heavy trucks and large diesel engines. In the 2016–2017 period, it was completely replaced by the Nitta and Koga plants for those, keeping since then only some activities related to vehicle parts. Hino plans to completely shut down the Hino plant by 2025. The plant site is about 300,000 m² (3,200,000 sq ft). In December 2022, Hino said it wanted to sell one third of that land.

The Koga plant became fully operational in 2017, after gradually starting operations of its different production lines. The plant produces parts, axles, frames as well as medium and heavy trucks both as knock-down kits and as fully assembled units. The plant site is about 660,000 m² (7,100,000 sq ft). The built area of the Koga plant is divided into five operations: knock down plant (26,000 m², 280,000 sq ft), axle plant (13,000 m², 140,000 sq ft), frame plant (12,000 m², 130,000 sq ft), cab plant (22,000 m², 240,000 sq ft) and vehicle assembly plant (61,000 m², 660,000 sq ft).

## Motorsport

"Team Samurai" entered a Contessa in the Trans Am Series in 1966 at the race at Riverside International Raceway. After being retired due to a collision, the team withdrew from the series.

Hino has competed in the Dakar Rally since 1991 with a Ranger FT 4WD truck driven by the Japanese rally driver, Yoshimasa Sugawara. Hino has always finished in the Top 10 in the Camion Category, and 1–2–3 overall in the 1997 event.


## Concept vehicles

An autonomous modular concept vehicle, dubbed Flatformer, was co-developed by Hino and REE Automotive and displayed at the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show. The Flatformer features a flat chassis platform that can have different chassis bodies interchanged autonomously on top of it, such as a body with package delivery cubbies, a body providing retail services, and a body for shuttling passengers.


## Legal issues

In January 2025, Hino was ordered to pay a total of $1.6 billion in fines after agreeing to plead guilty to charges of fraud in the US District Court in Detroit for unlawfully selling heavy-duty diesel engines in the United States that did not meet emissions standards from 2010 to 2022.
