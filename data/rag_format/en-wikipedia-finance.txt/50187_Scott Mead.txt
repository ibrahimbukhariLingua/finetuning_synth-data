## Early life and education

Scott Mead was born in Washington, DC. His father, James M. Mead, was a businessperson. With extended family based out of Erie, Pennsylvania during his youth, Mead's grandfather John J. Mead Jr. had been a press journalist and photographer for the *Erie Times-News*, founded and owned by the Mead family. After accompanying his grandfather on assignments as a small child, Mead picked up photography after he was given one of his grandfather's cameras at age thirteen. Mead taught himself how to develop photographs in his parents' basement. He attended high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, graduating in 1973. In 1974 he began attending Harvard College. At Harvard he majored in American history and literature, also focusing on the visual arts under professors such as William Eggleston. Mead graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1977. After receiving the Harvard Scholar award that year to attend Cambridge University, in 1979 he graduated Cambridge's Emmanuel College with a Master of Philosophy. Mead subsequently received a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania law school in 1982.


## Business career


### 1980s-2003: Goldman Sachs

Early in his career Mead worked at First Boston Corporation and moved to Goldman Sachs in New York in 1986 as vice president in their corporate finance department, before being transferred to London in 1988, where he became a Goldman Sachs managing director and later partner. At Goldman Sachs he soon took on the roles of chairman of the global telecoms, media, entertainment and technology group and the head of European Privatizations, advising several major deals. In 1999 he was Goldman Sachs' chief negotiator and advisor for Vodafone's takeover of the German telecom group Mannesmann. The value of the acquisition neared $200 billion, considered the largest in history. He also advised Vodafone on its $66.5 billion takeover of Airtouch Communications. During his time with Goldman Sachs, he oversaw mergers and transactions totaling approximately $500 billion. After retiring as a partner and managing director from Goldman Sachs in 2003, he ran and managed his own private equity activities, advised a group of "blue-chip" companies, and focused on philanthropy.


### 2006-present: Apax and RPP

Mead joined a group of investors around 2006 who had purchased the Boston Celtics. After management made substantial investment in new talent and coaching, in 2008 the team won the NBA play-offs. From October 2006 until September 2008 Mead was a senior advisor at Apax Partners, serving as chairman of the company's global technology and telecommunications advisory board.

In 2007 Mead co-founded Richmond Park Partners (RPP) in London, taking on the role of president. The company initially focused on financial services and telecom clients in Europe and the Middle East. Since 2012 he has devoted much of his time to photography.


## Arts career

Mead minored in visual studies at Harvard, studying under photographers such as William Eggleston and Emmet Gowin in the mid-1970s. Among other projects, around this time he "used a complex photography technique to shoot a series of black and white photographs capturing rural New England" circular format. In 2009, Mead rediscovered old prints and negatives from his student years in his attic, and began re-immersing himself in photography.

In 2010, 25 of Mead's images from 1974 to 1977, many of them never printed before, were displayed at a London solo exhibition titled *Looking Back* at Mayfair gallery Hamilton's, with all funds donated to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Prints from the exhibit and other works were afterward selected for inclusion in the 2011 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and Mead also had prints selected for the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. In 2012 the BBC *Culture Show* program profiled his work, and Mead published the book *Looking Back* afterwards, featuring prints from his twenties. In October 2017 the aerial photography and philosophy book *Above the Clouds* was published by Prestel, with prints from the book exhibited in January 2018 at Hamiltons. His most recent book, *Equivalents* was published by Prestel in late 2022. The book, inspired by William Eggleston, features paired nature photographs, with text by Brad Leithauser.
