## Development

China is one of the world's leaders in consumer internet and mobile payments.¹³⁰ In most parts of the developed world, credit cards have been popular since the second half of 20th century but were not widespread in China.¹³⁰ China's wide adoption of mobile payments without significant credit card usage is an example of leapfrogging development.¹³⁰

The increase of mobile payment systems such as Alipay and WeChat Pay have facilitated the rapid rise of e-commerce in China. Mobile payment platforms help simplify the transaction process and ensure the security of transactions to win the trust of consumers. Therefore, the mobile payment system has completely changed the daily life of the Chinese people and the future business model. The rise of e-commerce has in turn facilitated the further rapid adoption of digital payment and mobile wallets.²
