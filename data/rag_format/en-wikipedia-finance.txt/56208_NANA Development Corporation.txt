NANA Development Corporation


# NANA Development Corporation



**NANA Development Corporation** headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska, was owned by NANA Regional Corporation—an Alaska Native Corporation formed under provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANSCA)—and functioned as the latter's business arm.


## History

In 1968, nine years after Alaska attained statehood, oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay. The discovery put the issue of Native lands into the forefront. Three years later, in 1971 President Richard Nixon signed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which conveyed nearly 150 million acres (610,000 km²) of federal land into the hands of 12 newly created Alaska Native regional corporations. One of these corporations was NANA Regional Corporation. In 1974, NANA Development Corporation was founded to function as the business arm of NANA Regional Corporation.

In November 2017, the company's subsidiary, Akima LLC, fired one of its employees, Juli Briskman, after a news photographer caught her giving the finger to the presidential motorcade of Donald Trump as it passed by her. She is not identifiable in the photo, but after it went viral she posted it on her social media accounts and voluntarily identified herself to the company's human resources department that she is the person in it. Four months after being fired, she sued the company for wrongful termination and for additional severance pay. In the 2019 Virginia elections, Briskman was elected to the board of supervisors for Loudoun County, Virginia.
