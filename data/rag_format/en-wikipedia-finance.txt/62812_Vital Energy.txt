**Vital Energy, Inc. (formerly Laredo Petroleum, Inc.)** is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Delaware with its principal operational headquarters located in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Laredo Petroleum has no connection or association with Laredo Oil, a penny stock E&P traded on the pink sheet over-the-counter market.

As of December 31, 2020, the company had 278 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.70×10⁹ GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 24% was petroleum, 36% was natural-gas condensates and 39% was natural gas. All of these reserves were in the Permian Basin, where the company controlled 133,199 net acres.

The company drills almost all of its wells using what it calls the "earth model", which it claims increases efficiency.
