## Minister of Finance of Republika Srpska (2010–2018)

Tegeltija was appointed Minister of Finance of the Republika Srpska entity on 29 December 2010 in the government of Aleksandar Džombić, and was later confirmed in the post in the first and second cabinet of Željka Cvijanović in 2013 and 2014.

During his ministerial tenure, three banks failed in Republika Srpska, including *Bobar Banka* and *Balkan Investment Bank*. Tegeltija's government increased its capital in the latter by €15,000,000 in 2013, becoming majority owner of it. The bank changed its name in *Bank of Srpska*, but was liquidated in 2016, with a loss estimated at €60,000,000 in public and private deposits. The RS Banking Agency, under the jurisdiction of Tegeltija's entity ministry of Finance, was blamed for lack of supervision on the banking sector.

## Chairman of the Council of Ministers (2019–2023)


### Appointment

After a one year governmental formation crisis following the 2018 general election, on 5 December 2019, the national House of Representatives confirmed the appointment of Tegeltija as the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The whole government was confirmed by Parliament on 23 December.


### Domestic policy

At a national House of Representatives session held on 11 January 2021, a vote of no confidence in Tegeltija took place, due to poor results during his term as chairman of the Council of Ministers, but by the end of the voting, it was clear that Tegeltija was staying as chairman of the Council of Ministers. Three months later, on 28 April, another vote of no confidence in Tegeltija took place at a House of Representatives session, again without success.

On 28 September 2021, Tegeltija's government unanimously adopted the decision on temporary financing, which ensures safe functioning of state institutions. In October 2021, the cabinet, at the proposal of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, drafted a decision on temporary suspension and reduction of customs rates on imports of new electric and hybrid cars until 31 December 2022.

In February 2022, it was decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would inform neighbouring Croatian officials in diplomatic notes that it wants experts from Bosnia and Herzegovina to work together with Croatian experts on testing the soil of Trgovska gora, where a nuclear waste dump is planned to be built. Tegeltija said that the "health of the citizens in that area and environmental protection are a priority" and also pointed out his interest in the "provision of funds for soil testing."

Tegeltija served as chairman of the Council of Ministers until 25 January 2023, when a new cabinet headed by Borjana Krišto was formed.


#### Cabinet reshuffle

During the period from December 2019 until May 2020, the office of Minister of Human Rights and Refugees was vacant, with the leading parties in government not finding common ground on naming a new minister; eventually, DNS's Miloš Lučić was decided to take on the role of minister, getting confirmed by Parliament on 15 May 2020. Less then a month after Lučić's appointment, Fahrudin Radončić resigned as Minister of Security over a migration dispute with other members of Tegeltija's government; Radončić proposed the deportation of 9,000 migrants which Tegeltija was against. On 23 July 2020, Selmo Cikotić became the new Minister of Security in Tegeltija's cabinet, succeeding Radončić.

On 12 March 2021, Tegeltija dismissed Miloš Lučić from his duties as Minister of Human Rights and Refugees, following the abolishment of the coalition between Tegeltija's SNSD party and Lučić's DNS. Eighteen days later, on 30 March, the national House of Representatives confirmed Lučić's dismissal, but the decision officially never took effect because the national House of Peoples, the upper house of the bicameral Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, didn't confirm the dismissal.

In October 2021, the Minister of Defence in Tegeltija's cabinet, Sifet Podžić, canceled a military exercise between the Serbian Army and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the "bad epidemiological situation in the country and because of the small number of vaccinated members of the Armed Forces." This was met with outrage by Tegeltija, who sent a request for the removal of Podžić as minister to the national Parliament. Some days later, he submitted the decision on the dismissal of Podžić to the House of Representatives. On 26 October, the majority of the House of Representatives members voted against Tegeltija's decision and did not support Podžić's dismissal.


#### COVID-19 pandemic

Since March 2020, as head of government, Tegeltija has been one of the high ranking officials that has led Bosnia and Herzegovina's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 15 March 2020, the Council of Ministers issued a decision which forbid for foreign nationals entering Bosnia and Herzegovina to enter from areas with intensive transmission of COVID-19, and especially from: Provinces of the PRC (Wuhan), South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, France, Romania, Germany, Austria, Spain, Switzerland and Belgium. On 17 March, Tegeltija's government declared a state of emergency in the entire country.

On 24 March 2020, the Council of Ministers issued a decision which banned entrance for all foreigners, and also from 30 March, all borders at airports in Bosnia and Herzegovina were closed for passengers, and airplanes could land only to deliver cargo. On 21 May 2020, the government headed by Tegeltija adopted a decision which allowed entry and stay of a foreigner who entered Bosnia and Herzegovina due to business obligations, provided that they have an invitational letter from a legal entity from Bosnia and Herzegovina that hired them in the country and a certificate of a negative test for SARS-CoV-2 virus from an authorized laboratory, not older than 48 hours from the time of entry. Citizens of Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia could enter Bosnia and Herzegovina without any additional condition from 1 June 2020.

The effects of restrictive measures and their relaxation were scientifically analyzed. After the authorities lifted mandatory quarantine restrictions, the instantaneous reproduction number increased from 1.13 on 20 May to 1.72 on 31 May. On 7 November 2020, it was confirmed that Tegeltija tested positive for COVID-19; by 21 November, he recovered.

On 6 April 2021, anti-governmental protests "Fight for Life" were held by a group of citizens and activists in Sarajevo in front of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Federal Government, seeking resignations from Tegeltija and Federal Prime Minister Fadil Novalić, due to lack of leadership during the pandemic and late procurement of COVID-19 vaccines. Further anti-governmental protests were held eleven days later, on 17 April as well.

On 22 July 2021, Tegeltija called on the competent authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to speed up the process of vaccination of the country's population, saying "So far, we have received about 1.6 million vaccines, start with the mass immunization."

On 18 October 2021, Tegeltija's government adopted the information of the Ministry of Civil Affairs on the need to conclude a contract on compensation between the Council of Ministers and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, thus creating preconditions for the delivery of the previously paid COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. On 16 December 2021, the cabinet gave its consent for the introduction of covid-certificates at the national level.


### Foreign policy

In April 2021, Tegeltija reacted to a supposed non-paper sent by Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, regarding possible border changes in the Western Balkans, saying that he isn't "a man of inflammatory rhetoric" and that he "will not deal with fictional papers."

#### European Union

On 30 June, Tegeltija spoke in a telephone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel about the future of EU potential enlargement, ahead of the 2021 Berlin Process Summit. On 14 September 2021, Tegeltija met in person with Merkel at a Western Balkans meeting in Tirana, Albania, where they talked about the COVID-19 pandemic, Berlin Process, EU enlargement and the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
