# Independent Sector



**Independent Sector** is a coalition of nonprofit organizations, foundations and corporate giving programs in the United States. Founded in 1980, it is the first organization to combine the grant seekers and grantees.

Located in Washington, D.C., Independent Sector largely works on federal policy issues that affect the nonprofit and philanthropic sector, including tax incentives and exemption status of organizations within the sector.

Several other organizational goals include cultivating leaders and emerging leaders, supporting and enhancing organizational effectiveness and ethical practices, and being the vital voice of the sector.
