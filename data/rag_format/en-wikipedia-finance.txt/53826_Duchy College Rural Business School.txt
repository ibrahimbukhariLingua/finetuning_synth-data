It is a consortium of academic units delivering projects for the government, levy-funded research bodies, research councils, and commercial clients. It runs the Farm Business Survey, which it carries out for Defra.

## Rural Development Programme for England projects

The Rural Business School runs a number of RDPE funded projects. These include:

SWARM works with funding agencies, farming groups and other stakeholders to ensure up to date knowledge on all aspects of farm resource management is available to the local farming community.
