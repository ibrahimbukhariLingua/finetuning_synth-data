Over the course of three decades, he went on to hold many senior executive roles across the bank, working in four different countries. In 1993, he was appointed Head of Corporate Banking in Canada. Two years later, Masrani relocated to Mumbai, India where he set up TD's first office in that country. In 1999, Masrani moved to London, England to lead TD's discount brokerage business TD Waterhouse in the UK as Senior Vice President.

Masrani returned to Toronto in 2003 as Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer of TD Bank Group.

When TD expanded into the US with the acquisition of Banknorth in 2006, he moved to Portland as President of TD Banknorth.

Masrani became Group Head, US Personal and Commercial Banking and CEO of TD Bank, N.A.

When President and CEO W. Edmund Clark announced his upcoming retirement, this led to a succession planning contest between Masrani, Mike Pedersen (Group Head of Wealth, Insurance, and Corporate Office), and Tim Hockey (Group Head of Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, as President and CEO of TD Canada Trust).

In 2024, under Masrani's leadership, TD Bank became the largest bank in U.S. history to plead guilty to violating money laundering prevention laws, and agreed to pay over $3 billion in penalties to resolve the charges. A statement from TD Bank claimed, "We have taken full responsibility for the failures of our U.S. AML program and are making the investments, changes and enhancements required to deliver on our commitments. This is a difficult chapter in our Bank's history. These failures took place on my watch as CEO and I apologize to all our stakeholders," Bharat Masrani, Group President and Chief Executive Officer, TD Bank Group.
