He was the first Chief Executive for the Gold Coast Titans, whose inaugural season in the National Rugby League was 2007.

## Playing career

Son of former player Tom Searle, Michael Searle played rugby league in the forwards for the Gold Coast club of the 1980s and 1990s.


## Administration career

A month after starting an accountancy firm, at age 29 Searle agreed to lead the Gold Coast's bid for an NRL licence on 15 March 1999. The Titans' first season was the 2007 Telstra Premiership. During the 2012 NRL season it was revealed that the Titans club was heavily in debt and the prospect of bankruptcy hung over the club. Gold Coast managed to recover but it would be Searle's last year in the Chief Executive role.
