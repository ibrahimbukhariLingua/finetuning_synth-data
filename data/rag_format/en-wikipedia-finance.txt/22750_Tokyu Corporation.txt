Tokyu Corporation


# Tokyu Corporation



The **Tokyu Corporation** (東急株式会社, *Tōkyū kabushiki-gaisha*), a contraction of and formerly ***Tō**kyō **Kyū**kō Dentetsu kabushiki gaisha* (**東**京**急**行電鉄株式会社, "**Tokyo Express Electric Railway Share Company**") until 2 September 2019, is a Japanese *keiretsu* or conglomerate headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo. While a multinational corporation, its main operation is the **Tokyu Railways Company, Ltd.** (ja:東急電鉄株式会社, *Tōkyū Dentetsu kabushiki gaisha*), a wholly-owned subsidiary operating railways in the Greater Tokyo Area.


## History

The oldest predecessor of company was the **Musashi Electric Railway (武蔵電気鉄道, *Musashi Denki Tetsudō*)**, opened in 1908. The railway's operations were converted into a kabushiki gaisha (company) in 1910. Keita Gotō, now a notable Japanese industrialist, was appointed as the CEO in 1920 and he began a major expansion program.

The most important predecessor was first registered on September 2, 1922, as the **Meguro-Kamata Electric Railway (目黒蒲田電鉄, *Meguro-Kamata Dentetsu*)** and is related to the construction of Den-en-chōfu. It was originally founded by the developers of Den-en-chōfu). It was acquired by the Musashi Electric Railway in 1924, shortly before Musashi was renamed into the Tokyo-Yokohama Electric Railway (東京横浜電鉄, *Tōkyō-Yokohama Dentetsu*), also known as the Toyoko, in the same year.

After Musashi/Toyoko's acquisition, the Meguro-Kamata Electric Railway initially operated as a subsidiary of Toyoko. It was not until 16 October 1939 that both Toyoko and Meguro-Kamata Electric railways were formally merged and the new company took the Toyoko name.

In 1938, Toyoko established Toyoko Eiga [ja], possibly for competition with Ichizo Kobayashi's Toho Company. It became the Toei Company in 1951.

Toyoko took its current name on 1 May 1942, after the Japanese government compelled the company to acquire the Odawara Express Railway and the Keihin Electric Railway in 1943 to support Japan's efforts in Pacific War of World War II. In 1944 it also acquired the Keio Teito Electric Railway (which had merged with Odawara Express before in 1940).

In 1948, after the war, Tokyu divested the acquired companies, and the divested companies are now known as Odakyu Electric Railway, Keikyu Corporation, and Keio Corporation respectively. The 1943–48 era of Tokyu was colloquially known as *Dai-Tokyu* (lit. *Great Tokyu*).
