## *All-American Muslim* advertising

In December 2011, Kayak announced that it would not renew a contract to advertise on the TLC reality television show *All-American Muslim*. The decision followed a campaign by the Florida Family Association, a one-man fundamentalist organization focused on “defending American values". In a statement posted to the Kayak website, Kayak Chief Marketing Officer, Robert Birge, wrote that TLC “was not upfront with us about the nature of the show”.
