The Boulder Strip market is more dependent on slot machines than Downtown Las Vegas. The casinos are mostly oriented toward locals. Race and Sports book are more important. The entire Boulder Strip market (gaming and non-gaming) is a little smaller than the revenue generated by the Las Vegas properties of Wynn Resorts.


## List of Boulder Strip casinos

The Nevada Gaming Commission has stretched the definition of the **Boulder Strip** so that includes not just the Boulder Hwy., but all of the casinos in the city of Henderson. The following list includes gaming licenses for the Boulder Strip and the area of the casino. Since the 32 casinos include many small casinos, often equipped only with slot machines, this list is limited to casinos with gaming areas greater than 10,000 sq ft (930 m²). The casinos with gaming revenue over $72 M in fiscal year 2008 are noted.

The *total revenue* (gaming and non-gaming) for the 32 casinos was $1.248 billion. Individual revenues for casinos is difficult to know with certainty since many companies are private and do not report revenue, or they are public, but only report revenue for groups of casinos. From the NGC abstract we know that the top eight casinos collectively took in between $858 million and $1147 million with an individual minimum of $37 million. From the square footage of the casino floor, number of machines and gaming tables, general quality of the resort and an SEC report that said that Arizona Charlie's Boulder took in $48m in revenue in one year, one can assume that the top eight are the first eight in the above list.

Green Valley Ranch, Sunset Station, Boulder Station, and Sam's Town are the four largest casinos with roughly 2,500 slot machines apiece. Casino Montelago at Lake Las Vegas caters to tourists at the upscale resorts in Lake Las Vegas. Fiesta Henderson and Arizona Charlie's Boulder are the next in size. Eastside Cannery was under construction during the time period of the report (July 1, 2007 - June 30, 2008) so their revenue numbers represented the Nevada Palace, an older casino on the site. Joker's Wild and Eldorado Casino are both owned by Boyd gaming, and Joker's Wild is slightly larger with 30 more slot machines and a poker room.

For the first 11 months of the last fiscal year gaming revenue is down 9.32% vs. 13.9% for Clark County as a whole partly because the Eastside Cannery Resort opened this fiscal year.

There are less than 3,000 rooms associated with all of these casinos so that non-gaming revenue consists of mostly food and beverages plus lease fees to secondary businesses like bowling alleys. The five largest of these casinos have a cinema attached to the complex leaving only the aging Cinedome Henderson which opened in 1993 as the only free standing first run cinema in Henderson.
