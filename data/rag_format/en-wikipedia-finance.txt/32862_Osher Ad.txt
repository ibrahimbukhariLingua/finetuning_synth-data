## History

the chain emerged following their previous venture, the "Alef" marketing chain, which catered primarily to an ultra-Orthodox audience. The trio, affiliated with the secular Gor and Naiad Hasidim, initially sold their shares in "Alf" to Shufersal in 2008 for NIS 140 million, leading to the establishment of Osher Ad after a one-year cooling-off period.

According to the Dun & Bradstreet ranking published in 2023, Osher Ad is the third largest food chain in Israel in terms of sales turnover, with an amount of NIS 4.9 billion per year.

In 2019, the chain opened their first store outside of Israel, in the United States, in Lakewood, New Jersey.

Their supermarkets has products with Kosher foods.
