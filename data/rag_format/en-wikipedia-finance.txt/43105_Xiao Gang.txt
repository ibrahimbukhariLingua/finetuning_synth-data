Xiao Gang was appointed chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission in March 2013. He was the scapegoat for critics after the July–August 2015 stock market mayhem (28% drop in value). He is blamed for allowing a speculative bubble to grow which led millions of Chinese families to lose their invested savings. In an article of *Foreign policy*, David Wertime argues that the Chinese government, through its state-controlled media outlets, clearly favored Xiao Gang's fast-growth policy.

On 20 February 2016, Xiao stepped down as chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. He is a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the China Finance 40 Forum (CF40).
