# British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association



Established in 1967, the British Vehicle Rental & Leasing Association (BVRLA) is the UK trade body for companies engaged in vehicle rental, leasing and fleet management.

On behalf of 1040 member organisations, the BVRLA works with governments, public sector agencies, industry associations, consumer groups and other stakeholders across a wide range of road transport, environmental, taxation, technology and finance-related issues.

BVRLA members are responsible for a combined fleet of almost five million cars, vans and trucks on UK roads, or 1-in-5 cars, 1-in-6 vans and 1-in-6 trucks. The vehicle rental and leasing industry supports over 465,000 jobs, adds £7.6bn in tax revenues and contributes £49bn to the UK economy each year.

It seeks to look after the interests of, and sets standards for operational quality for, both the contract hire and leasing sectors and the daily hire (car rental) sectors. The BVRLA represents both the business contract hire and personal contract purchase industry.

This involves developing policy areas across the wide range of industry issues, lobbying decision-makers in the UK and in Europe.
