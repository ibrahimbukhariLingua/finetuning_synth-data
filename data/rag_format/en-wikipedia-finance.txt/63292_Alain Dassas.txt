### Renault

In 1983, Renault hired Dassas to manage the company's financial offices in New York. In 1986, he was named chief operating officer of the Société Financière et Foncière (Renault's bank). He also was assigned to manage relationships with banks and financial markets. In 1990, he became Financial Director of Renault Crédit International. In 1997 he was named vice president, Financial Operations of Renault and participated in several key agreements for the future of the company, such as negotiations with Volvo AB, the joint venture with AvtoVAZ, the acquisition of a majority stake in Dacia and Renault Samsung Motors and the alliance with Nissan. In 2001, he was named Senior Vicepresident, Finance and in 2003 he joined the board of directors of Renault.

In 2010, he became a company's consultant.


#### Renault F1

Dassas played a major role during the purchase of Benetton Formula by Renault in 2000, which then would be called Renault F1 Team . Later, he was involved in financial negotiations with Bernard Ecclestone.

On 3 April 2006, Dassas replaced Patrick Faure as President of the team. During his first year Renault was one of the dominant forces in Formula One and won the constructors' and drivers' championships.

In 1999, Dassas was a member of the board of directors of Nissan Diesel.

On 4 September 2007, it was announced his transfer to Nissan as chief financial officer (CFO), a position which became effective on 17 September.

On 5 October 2009, the Yokohama-based automaker announced that on 1 December Dassas would leave his post, returning to France, being replaced as CFO by Joseph G. Peter.
