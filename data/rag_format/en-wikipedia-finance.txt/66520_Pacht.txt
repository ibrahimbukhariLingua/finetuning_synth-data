Pacht


# Pacht



The institution of the ***pacht*** or ***pacht-stelsel*** (revenue farm, pl. ***pachten***) was a system of tax farming in the Dutch Republic and its colonial empire. In this system tax is not collected by the government, but by a private individual who has leased the right to collect the tax. In the Dutch Republic, for example, this was common practise for a long time, especially for indirect taxes. Each year, the highest bidder acquired the right to collect certain taxes; he paid a rent for this to the government, and all he collected more was for the tax tenant himself. The rationale behind this system was that by outsourcing taxation, local governments could exert less influence on collection. Also, a tenant would collect taxes more scrupulously, because it would personally benefit him.

In practice, however, there was much dissatisfaction with the tax tenants, especially among the common man. After the Pachtersoproer of 1748, the system was largely abolished in the Republic. From then on, the tax was collected through the so-called *Collecte*, which meant that the government appointed and controlled tax collectors.

The Dutch also instituted a *pacht-stelsel* in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and Dutch Cape Colony (now South Africa), whereby the colonial state sub-contracted the sovereign right of tax collection to *pachters*. It formed one of the main sources of the colonial state revenue prior to the twentieth century.

Like in the Dutch Republic the private tax collectors could extract profits on top of what was due to the authorities, and were in addition allowed to enforce their rights with private armies and intelligence agencies. The pachters usually employed administrators, the *kuasa pacht*, to run the day-to-day operations of their pachten. A pacht territory could be managed as a discrete unit or divided further into smaller farms, sub-contracted to sub-farmers.

The Dutch colonial authorities granted or auctioned off pachten for the sale of opium and salt, for the running of toll houses, pawnshops and gambling dens, for the collection of land, market and poll taxes, for the management of forests, and for the gathering of produce such as birds' nests, pearls, trepang and sponges. As the colonial state became more centralised, most of these revenue farms were gradually taken over by the government or state monopolies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.
