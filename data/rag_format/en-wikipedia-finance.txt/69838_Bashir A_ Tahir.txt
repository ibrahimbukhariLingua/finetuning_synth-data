## Investment Focus

Tahir helped the Dhabi Group to evolve from a family office engaged in primarily passive investments into a vehicle that acted as a lead investor for a consortium of investors known as the Abu Dhabi Group. The key focus areas became banking, telecommunications and real estate.

Bashir Tahir was the first to promote and encourage this approach: to be a portfolio investor in a market whereby the country can benefit from inward foreign direct investment that directly helps to create jobs as well as to help attract new investors. This longer-term partnership defined the access and readiness of countries to encourage investment groups that could provide a source of multi-sector investment and help reduce volatilities through such long-term partnerships.
