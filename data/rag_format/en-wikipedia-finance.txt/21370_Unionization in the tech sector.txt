Unionization in the tech sector


# Unionization in the tech sector



A **tech union** is a trade union for tech workers typically employed in high tech or information and communications technology sectors. Due to the evolving nature of technology and work, different government agencies have conflicting definitions for who is a tech worker. Most definitions include computer scientists, people working in IT, telecommunications, media and video gaming. Broader definitions include all workers required for a tech company to operate, including on-site service staff, contractors, and platform economy workers.


## Global

UNI Global Union is a global union federation that has an Information, Communications, Technology and Related Services (ICTS) sector.

In 2021, UNI Global Union and international workers of Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced an international union coalition called Alpha Global to assist in organizing the company's global workforce.


## Australia

Professionals Australia is the union that represents Australian tech workers.


## Czechia

The ICT Union (Czech: *ICT Odbory*) was formed in the summer of 2021. It has public campaigns with Expedia and Red Hat Czech. It is affiliated with the OSPPP (Czech: *Odborový svaz pracovníků peněžnictví a pojišťovnictví*, lit. 'Trade Union of Money and Insurance Workers') which in turn is affiliated with the ČMKOS federation.


## France

Solidaires Informatique is a union that includes game workers and filed a lawsuit against game developer Ubisoft in 2021.


## Germany

The German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) has the principle of one trade union for each company. In practice, the two largest trade unions, IG Metall and ver.di have been competing since the early 1990s to represent the tech industry which are part of the newer economies. High-tech workers in Germany have lower union density than other workers, and are less likely to engage in collective bargaining and are more likely to engage in alternative organisations, sometimes in direct competition with trade unions.

At IBM Germany, the two unions formed a joint collective bargaining committee to resolve their internal union competition. SAP employees are similarly represented by both unions.

Tech companies in Berlin have increasingly formed works councils, notably at TikTok, Tesla, Gorillas, N26, and Zalando.


## Ireland

The Financial Services Union (FSU) has produced surveys, research, and legislative action around the IT, tech, and financial tech sectors as early as 2019.


## Israel

*Cellular, Internet and High-Tech* was founded in 2014 as an affiliate of the Israeli trade union confederation Histadrut. It represents 3,000 workers through the collective bargaining agreement it has with 6 high-tech firms including the Israel divisions of SAP and Visonic. A further 200 employees of Surecomp are organized through the other Israeli federation, Koach LaOvdim.


## People's Republic of China


### Mainland China

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is officially the only trade union in China and acts as an extension of the state's interests. It either co-opts or restricts independent labour organizing. Most trade union chairs in China are company managers, party cadre members and appointed, rather than elected. The Foxconn Trade Union was formed in November 2006. It represents 90 percent of Foxconn's 1.4 million workers in China and is a company union dominated by management. However, since 2010, due to increased labour militancy and strikes, workers through China have been able to demand more worker representation in union elections.

In 2018 Jasic Technology retaliated against a worker led union drive. Over 100 students and workers were arrested including members of Jasic Workers Solidarity Group in what became known as the Jasic incident.

In March 2019, Chinese tech workers mobilized, after an anonymous person uploaded a repository named 996.icu to GitHub. 996 refers to 9 am to 9 pm, 6 days a week or 72-hour work cycle. Over 230,000 tech workers, mainly in China 'starred' or 'liked' the repository, making it one of the largest tech actions in China. US based Microsoft (which own GitHub) employees signed a letter in support of the 996 movement, opposing censorship.


### Hong Kong

In the context of the pro-democracy 2019 protests, tech workers founded the Hong Kong Information Technology Workers' Union and developed a database of sympathetic employers who are supportive of the protests. The union was later dissolved due to widespread state repression in Hong Kong following the protests.


## Philippines

The Business Process Outsourcing Industry Employee's Network (BIEN), historically organized call center workers and more recently has focused on organizing tech industry contract workers. In 2021, the union's president had to move into hiding after increased government surveillance and right-wing targeting of left and labor organizers and organizations in the country. BIEN has a long history of organizing in solidarity with US and Canada tech, media, and telecommunications union Communications Workers of America (CWA), including an incident in 2016 where BIEN and CWA organizers were held at gunpoint by an armed right-wing militia during an organizing effort.


## Romania

Sindicatul IT Timișoara (SITT; Romanian IT Union) represents 3,000 IT and outsourcing workers at Alcatel-Lucent, Wipro, Accenture and Alto since 2009. In 2015, SITT met with UNI Global Union to develop an organizing strategy.

## United States

Tech unionization is historically relatively new in the United States, with the exception of telecommunications. Workplaces are primarily organized with the Communications Workers of America and to a lesser extent OPEIU, USW, Teamsters. The overall private job sector has a historically low union density rate of 7 percent, with the tech industry being even lower than that.

From 1974 to 1983, the United Electrical (UE) formed a Silicon Valley Electronics Organizing Committee (EOC), which was made up of 1 full time staffer and a dedicated network of rank and file from National Semiconductor, Siltec, Fairchild, Siliconix, Semimetals, and others. They had a newsletter called "The Union Voice" in English, Spanish and Tagalog languages.

Between 1970 and 2016, a patchwork of IBM worker initiatives formed including the National Black Workers Alliance, IBM Workers United and Alliance@IBM.

Since 2014, various Amazon worker initiatives have largely unsuccessfully sought union recognition in different Amazon warehouses. In 2021, members of Teamsters voted at a convention to form an 'Amazon division' to make it a strategic priority.

Unionization has picked up speed since 2019 as several unions have successfully launched initiatives to organize tech workers, such as the Communications Workers of America, United Steel Workers and Office and Professional Employees International Union.

In March 2019, 5 employees of npm, Inc. were laid off, 4 of whom were involved in organizing for a union. In July, npm settled with three employees for $105,000 after they filed a complaint with the NLRB alleging retaliation.

### Communications Workers of America

In January 2018, 15 employees of logistics startup company Lanetix were fired, 10 days after they petitioned to form a union with Washington-Baltimore News Guild (CWA). In November, the company agreed to pay $775,000 to the 15 former employees after the NLRB found they retaliated.

In January 2020, the Communications Workers of America launched the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA) to organize tech, game, and digital workers in the US and Canada. According to the CODE-CWA website "thousands of tech, game, and digital workers" have organized with over a dozen CODE-CWA organizing campaigns, including several certified unions with collective bargaining rights. As of August 2022, CODE-CWA has organized over 3000 union members in various sub-industries of the tech sector across over 25 bargaining units in the last two years of organizing.

Within its first year the CODE-CWA campaign unionized workers at Glitch, Blue State Digital, the Alphabet Workers Union at Alphabet, and game studio Voltage Entertainment. In 2021, workers at Do Better Tech, Mobilize, Medium, NPR, Mapbox, Catalist, Change.org, EveryAction, and New York Times Tech staff launched public unionization drives, with civic tech companies Mobilize, Catalist and Change.org receiving voluntary recognition from their employers.

CODE-CWA has also organized the first table-top game company at Pathfinder and Starfinder developer Paizo.

Glitch staff announced intentions to unionize with the CWA Local 1101 as part of CODE-CWA in early 2020. The company voluntarily recognized their union. Around the same time, the company laid off a third of its staff of 50 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Glitch signed a collective bargaining agreement in March 2021, the first in the American tech industry.

On January 4, 2021, over 400 employees (out of 130,000) of Alphabet (parent company of Google) formed the Alphabet Workers Union (CWA Local No. 1400) with a rare solidarity union model, which is not registered with the National Labor Relations Board, and thus cannot engage in collective bargaining. Alphabet Workers Union is notably open to non Alphabet employees, including Temporary, Vendor, and Contract workers, who make up almost half of the workforce.

On April 13, 2021, more than 650 tech workers at the New York Times announced that they were unionizing with the NewsGuild-CWA. In July 2021 the workers filed for union certification with the National Labor Relations Board.
