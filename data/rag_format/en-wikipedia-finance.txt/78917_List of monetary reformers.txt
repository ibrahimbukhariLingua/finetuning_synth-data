List of monetary reformers


# List of monetary reformers



This is a list of **monetary reformers** from the past to the present according to several schools of thought.

Monetary reformers primarily belong to the following groups:

* Supporters of publicly issued money who oppose charging interest on issuance of money, formerly called "Greenbackers" in late 19th century United States,
* the Austrian School who generally support a return to the gold standard or full-reserve banking, and
* the Post-Keynesian School whoʷʰᵒ? generally wish to regulate or reduce leverage and debt in the economy or direct it to "productive, non-speculative" uses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Most of these groupsᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ are critical of fractional-reserve banking, a practice which is described by critics as "creating money out of thin air". According to the Bank of England "rather than banks lending out deposits that are placed with them, the act of lending creates deposits – the reverse of the sequence typically described in textbooks".
