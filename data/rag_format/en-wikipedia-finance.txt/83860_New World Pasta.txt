New World Pasta


# New World Pasta



The **New World Pasta Company**, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ebro Foods,
was a retail branded pasta manufacturer headquartered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The company was formed in 1999 when the Hershey Company's pasta business was divested to a private equity group. After its formation, New World Pasta acquired the four remaining brands of Borden's pasta business in July 2001 that the American Italian Pasta Company had not purchased a month earlier (Prince, Creamette, Catelli, and Lancia). New World Pasta declared bankruptcy in 2004.
In 2006 it was acquired by Ebro Puleva S.A., a food company based in Spain.

As part of Ebro Puleva, New World Pasta acquired Strom Products in 2012, including the No Yolks and Wacky Mac brands.

Effective January 1, 2017, American Rice, Inc., and New World Pasta Company merged into Riviana Foods Inc.

On November 5, 2020, it was announced that the American Beauty, Creamette, Light 'n Fluffy, No Yolks, Prince, San Giorgio, Skinner, and Wacky Mac brands would be sold to TreeHouse Foods. This was followed by the sale of the Catelli and Lancia brands to Barilla on February 1, 2021, and the flagship Ronzoni brand to Post Holdings on March 30, 2021.
