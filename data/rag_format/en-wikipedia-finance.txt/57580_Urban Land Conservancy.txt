Urban Land Conservancy


# Urban Land Conservancy



**Urban Land Conservancy** (ULC), a Denver-based nonprofit established in 2003, that acquires and develops real estate assets. ULC targets properties to address issues of affordable housing and equitable access to essential services.


## History

Urban Land Conservancy was established in 2003 with capital from the Gary-Williams Energy Corporation through the Piton Foundation, a philanthropic organization founded by Sam Gary.

ULC focuses on the acquisition and preservation of real estate for nonprofit and community organizations, addressing housing needs as well as educational and childcare needs.


## Practices

ULC utilizes a variety of real estate practices, including land banking and the practice of acquiring parcels of land for future development. They also use a community land trust (CLT) model with a 99-year, renewable ground lease to circumvent the expirations imposed by the city and federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). When they identify a development partner, a 99-year ground lease is signed with an automatic 99-year renewal for a total of 198 years.


## Funding

The Urban Land Conservancy has partnered with a variety of organizations to raise funding for land development along with receiving money from the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, both of which provide funding for affordable housing programs.


### Denver Transit Oriented Development Fund (TOD)

ULC, Enterprise Community Partners and the City and County of Denver partnered to establish the nation's first Transit Oriented Development fund. The revolving loan fund makes capital available to acquire and hold land for the development or preservation of affordable housing for up to five years along current and proposed transit corridors.

The TOD fund was created to develop and preserve 1,000 affordable homes along current and future transit corridors in Denver. Sites purchased through the fund are within one-half mile of fixed-rail transit stations or one-quarter mile of high-frequency bus stops.

The Urban Land Conservancy made the initial equity commitment of $1.5 million to the TOD fund and leads real estate acquisition, management, and disposition of assets to housing providers to meet the priorities of the fund.


### Calvert Facility Fund

Calvert Impact Capital created the fund under the name Ours to Own, which focuses on preserving real estate in urban centers for schools, community spaces, and affordable commercial spaces for nonprofits. $5.1 million was raised from hundreds of individual investors in the Denver region in the first two years of Ours to Own. In addition to small individual investments, the fund received investment from the Piton Foundation, Gary Community Investments, Colorado Health Foundation, The Colorado Trust, and The Denver Foundation. In 2014, ULC partnered with Calvert Impact Capital to invest $10 million towards the purchase of three real-estate assets that support over 20 nonprofit organizations.


### Metro Denver Impact Facility (MDIF)

ULC, in partnership with FirstBank, The Colorado Health Foundation (CHF), The Denver Foundation (TDF) and the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority (CHFA), created the MDIF as a revolving door fund in order to invest in land projects in the Denver area. ULC is the sole borrower, and was responsible for creating the development plan and permanent financing structure. ULC also managed the condition of properties and where feasible, retained ownership interest as part of a community land trust.
