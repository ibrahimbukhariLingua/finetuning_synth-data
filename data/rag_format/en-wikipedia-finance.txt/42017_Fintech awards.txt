Fintech awards


# Fintech awards



**FinTech Awards** are several award ceremonies, most of them unrelated, which are held worldwide to recognize excellence in financial technology as assessed by either a public vote or panels of judges. There are typically many categories, winners and prizes. Hundreds of companies, including several fintech startups, participate as candidates.

Major fintech award ceremonies are held on an annual basis in India, Australia, Canada, Italy, United Kingdom, and United States. Other jurisdictions such as Luxembourg run these awards on a less regular basis. Some ceremonies are not national but continental, such as the Africa FinTech Summit, the Asia Fintech Awards and the European Fintech Awards.
