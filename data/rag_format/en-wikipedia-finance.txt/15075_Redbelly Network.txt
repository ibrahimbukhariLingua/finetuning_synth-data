Redbelly Network


# Redbelly Network



**Redbelly Network** is a blockchain platform designed for compliant on-chain tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). It was developed from research at the University of Sydney in collaboration with CSIRO's Data61 and was commercialized in 2021.


## History

Redbelly Network was founded in 2016 under the leadership of Vincent Gramoli, who serves as the Founder and Chief Technology Officer. In 2021, the project transitioned into a commercial enterprise, aiming to integrate digital and physical economies through blockchain technology.


## Technology

Redbelly Network employs a leaderless consensus mechanism called Deterministic Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT), which improves security by preventing forking and mitigating double-spending. The platform integrates full user identity verification and accountability at the transaction layer using zero-knowledge proofs and verifiable credentials to protect personally identifiable information.


## Features

Redbelly Network is designed for compliant tokenization of various asset classes, including private equity and carbon credits. It enables asset issuers to create on-chain structured products while ensuring regulatory compliance. The network is built for high performance and scalability, catering to both institutional and retail investors.


## Partnerships and Developments

Redbelly Network has engaged in multiple tokenization projects, including:

* A partnership with Liquidise to tokenize $500 million in private equity.
* A collaboration with Hutly to tokenize $1.8 billion in rent rolls.
* A joint initiative with CarbonHood and Blubird to tokenize $70 billion in carbon credits.

## Compliance and Accountability

Redbelly Network emphasizes compliance at the protocol level by requiring users to verify their real-world identities through off-chain digital identity providers. This approach aligns with regulatory standards and ensures secure transactions.
