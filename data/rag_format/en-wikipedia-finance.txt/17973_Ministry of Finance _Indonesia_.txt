Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)


# Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)



The **Ministry of Finance** (Indonesian: *Kementerian Keuangan*) is an Indonesian government ministry responsible for the nation's finance and state assets. The finance minister is responsible to the President. The ministry's motto is *Nagara Dana Rak√ßa*, which means "guardian of state finance".


## History


### Colonial period

The Dutch East India Company was given **octrooi** to print money during the rule of Governor General Jan Pieterszoon Coen. Since the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company increased state revenue. The company raised state revenue by an obligation to surrender agricultural products (**verplichte leverentie**), restrictions on agricultural production (**contingenten**, which increased the price) and obligations to plant strategic agricultural products such as coffee (**preangerstelsel**).

When the British took over Dutch East India as part of the War of the Sixth Coalition and assigned Stamford Raffles as Lieutenant-Governor, he instituted reformation through land tax (**landrent**), which changed the former Dutch system, to enable the public to buy British products with money. This reform failed to introduce a standardized monetary system because of a lack of support from the local aristocracy and inadequate public knowledge of money and taxation calculation.

After the Napoleonic Wars, Dutch East India was returned to the Dutch by the British under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. Governor General Du Bus resumed economic development and established **De Javasche Bank** as part of financial and payment system reform. In 1836, van den Bosch introduced forced plantation (**cultuurstelsel**) to produce global-favored products. Forced plantation replaced the land tax system and aimed to introduce monetary economics to society. Forced plantation and forced labor had sufficient effect to introduce monetary economics.

Government policy was shifted into liberal economics. The policy was implemented as "*laissez faire, laissez passer*", in which economic responsibility is shifted to the private sector. The Department of Finance (**Departement van Financien**) was established to coordinate, develop and support financial administration. Centralized financial administration was done to facilitate management of state revenue and expenditure.

The Second World War put the Dutch colonial government in a difficult position. Before the Japanese landing, the President of De Javasche Bank, Dr. G.G. van Buttingha Wichers, sent gold deposits to South Africa and Australia from Cilacap. The Japanese colonial government forced the surrender of British, Dutch and Chinese Bank and invasion money. The war created a financial crisis.


### Early independence

After Japan's surrender to the Allied powers in August 1945, Indonesia declared independence. Ministry of Finance is officially established to replace the function of *Departement van Financien*.

The economic situation was dire because of high inflation (due to circulation of *De Javasche* Bank money, Dutch East Indies money and Japanese Yen). Dr. Samsi, as Minister of Finance, had information that Escompto Bank in Surabaya held reserve money from the Dutch Colonial Government.
