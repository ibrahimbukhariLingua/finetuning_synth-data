Two-Fifty


# Two-Fifty



**Two-Fifty**, formerly known as **250 Plaza**, is a 20-story, 229-foot-tall (70 m) skyscraper in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The tower contains offices, an Associated Bank branch, and ground floor commercial space. Two-Fifty is located at 250 East Wisconsin Avenue.


## History

Two-Fifty was originally built in 1973 as the First Savings Plaza. In 2003, anchor tenant Marcus Corp. left Two-Fifty, vacating 56,000 square feet of office space. The building would go into receivership in 2009. In August 2015, Chicago-based Fulcrum Asset Advisors and Millbrook Properties purchased Two-Fifty for $9.75 million, intending to substantially renovate the property. Since the acquisition, the owners spent around $8.5 million in improvements for Two-Fifty, including repairs to the facade and revamping of the lobby and canopy. Associated Bank announced that it would open a 2,100 square foot retail branch in Two-Fifty in 2017. As of October 2021, Two-Fifty has an 80% occupancy rate.


## Construction

Two-Fifty was designed by Perkins & Will, while Klug & Smith Co. served as the builder. The building began construction in 1971 and was completed in 1973.
