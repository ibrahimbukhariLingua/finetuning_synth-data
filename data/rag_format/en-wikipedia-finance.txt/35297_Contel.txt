# Contel



**ConTel Corporation** (**Continental Telephone**) was the third largest independent phone company in the United States prior to it being acquired by GTE in 1991.


## History

Contel was founded in 1961 by Charles Wohlstetter, Philip J. Lucier, and one other partner. Continental was formed with the acquisition of the 2,000‐station Millstadt Ill., telephone. exchange. Philip J. Lucier was the company’s president until his death in July 24, 1970, after a bomb exploded in a company auto mobile on the parking lot of the Pierre Lacleve Center in Clayton. Mr. Lucier was in the driver’s seat at the time of the explosion.

In 1980, Contel purchased Network Analysis Corp, then the largest information technology consulting company in the world. As a result of this purchase, future Internet Hall of Fame Pioneer Howard Frank served as president and CEO of Contel Information Systems, a subsidiary of Contel Corporation from 1969 until 1985.

In 1986 ConTel of Indiana broke precedent and rescinded a 25¢ increase in their rates after a large protest. The vice president Merle Buck stated the protests were not about the decision, but for a decrease in interest rates and an abnormally good year in revenue for the company offset the costs the increase would have offset.
