The **economy of the Americas** comprises more than 1 billion people in 35 countries and 18 territories. Sometimes divided into the continents of North America and South America depending on the source, like other continents, the wealth between the states in the Americas varies considerably, with significant wealth inequality within nations. The difference in wealth across the Americas can be seen roughly between the economies of North America and South America, with the countries in the former (most notably the United States) significantly better off than those in the latter.
