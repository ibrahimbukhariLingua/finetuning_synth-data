## History

The society was established in 1974, with the objective of mobilizing savings from its members and providing loans to members, using those resources. In 2013, Joshua Ojall, the society CEO at the time, announced plans to build up to 100 housing units in the outskirts of Nairobi, the capital and largest city in Kenya and East Africa. The houses and apartments constructed using a US$5.2 million (KSh450 million) fund will be sold to Society members at between KSh2.8 million and KSh4.5 million (US$33,000 - US$52,000). The program is expected to roll out in other Kenyan urban centers after the Nairobi opening. In 2014, the Chairman of the Society announced plans to open a commercial bank, known as **Spire Bank**, between 2014 and 2018.


## Ownership

The shares of stock of Mwalimu National Sacco Limited are privately owned. The detailed shareholding in the Cooperative society is not widely, publicly known.


## Subsidiaries

In December 2014, Mwalimu Sacco acquired 51% shareholding in Equatorial Commercial Bank (ECB), a Kenyan retail commercial bank, for a cash payment of KES:1.7 billion (approximately USD:18 million). The sales agreement provided for the Sacco to purchase another 24% shareholding in the bank before 31 December 2015, to enable ECB comply with Central Bank of Kenya shareholding directives. The Sacco will then turn around and sell some of its shareholding in the bank, to some of its members. Following the resolution of objections raised by the *Cooperative Alliance of Kenya*, a commission set up to investigate the deal, gave its approval in March 2015.
