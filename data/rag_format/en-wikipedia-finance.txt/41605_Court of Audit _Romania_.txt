Court of Audit (Romania)


# Court of Audit (Romania)



The **Romanian Court of Accounts** (Romanian: *Curtea de Conturi a României*) is the Romanian state authority charged with conducting financial audit over the way the state and public resources are managed and used.


## History

The court was established by a law of 1864, signed by Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In December 1948, under the nascent communist regime, it was disbanded. Revived in 1973 as the Higher Court of Financial Control (*Curtea Superioară de Control Financiar*), this too was abolished in early 1990, following the Romanian Revolution. The Court of Audit was re-established by a law of 1992, and began functioning the following year.
