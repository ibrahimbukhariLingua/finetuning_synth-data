**Fransabank** (Arabic: فرنسبنك ) is one of the oldest banks in Lebanon. Today, Fransabank Group has a consolidated presence in eight countries: Lebanon, France, Algeria, Sudan, Belarus, Iraq, UAE (Abu Dhabi) and Ivory Coast. The Group also ranks first in terms of local branch network with 125 branches strategically spread all over the country.


## History

In 1921, the Bank opened as a branch of Crédit Foncier d'Algérie et de Tunisie (CFAT).

In 1963, the CFAT was renamed to the new name of *Société Centrale de Banque*, and in 1971 its Lebanese entity was purchased by Banque Française pour le Moyen-Orient SAL (BFMO), a Lebanese banking company. After numerous mergers with other Lebanese banks, in 1982 the bank was renamed Fransabank.
