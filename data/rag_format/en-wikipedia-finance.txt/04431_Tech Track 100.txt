Tech Track 100


# Tech Track 100



The Sunday Times **Tech Track 100** is an annual league table published in association with The Sunday Times newspaper in the UK. It ranks Britain’s 100 private technology (TMT) companies with the fastest-growing sales over their last three years. It is published in The Sunday Times each September, with an awards event typically held in November, and networking dinners for alumni companies throughout the year. The league table is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business.


## About Fast Track

Fast Track is a leading research and events company that has built a network of the UK’s top-performing private companies, from the fastest-growing to the biggest, through its rankings in The Sunday Times. Founded in 1997 by Hamish Stevenson, it now publishes seven annual league tables and brings company founders and directors together at invitation-only networking awards events and alumni dinners.


## Criteria

Companies have to meet the below criteria to be able to qualify for the Tech Track 100 league table:

• Independent technology company

• UK registered, unquoted, and not subsidiaries

• Sales of at least £250,000 in the base year

• Sales of at least £5m in the latest year

• Trading weeks in the base and latest years have to exceed 25

Companies that do not meet the criteria can still be considered for the Ones to Watch programme. This is a selection of companies that have either achieved, or predict, good sales growth.


### Exclusions

• Excluded companies include payday lenders, computer resellers and companies that are equal joint ventures, or majority-owned by quoted or other companies. IT consultancies and IT services companies are required to generate a significant proportion of their sales from proprietary technologies.


## Notable alumni companies

• Blue Prism, the automation software developer, featured as a One to Watch in 2015 with sales of £4.5m. It floated in 2016 raising £21.1m. In June 2019, it acquired thoughtonomy, No. 4 in Tech Track 100 2018, in a $100m deal.

## Previous rankings

The 2012 Sunday Times Tech Track 100 league table ranked the top 100 of Britain's private technology, digital media and telecoms (TMT) companies that demonstrated the fastest sales growth over the preceding three years, between 2008 and 2011, or between 2009 and 2012.

The 2012 Tech Track included a new category, *Ones to Recognise*, for the first time since the inaugural awards in 1997. This is a list of five companies which demonstrate strong potential but did not make it into the top 100 spots.
