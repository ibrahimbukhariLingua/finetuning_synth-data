## History

Iress stands for Integrated Real-time Equity System. The company was formed in June 1993 as Dunai Financial Systems (DFS) by Peter Dunai, Neil Detering and Hung Do. Two years later the equity information software product ‘Iress’ was launched. In January 1997 Bridge Information Systems acquired 80% of Dunai Financial Systems (DFS) and formed BridgeDFS.

In June 1997 the trading software product ‘Iress Order System (IOS)’ was launched, in line with the ASX options market moving from floor to screen to commence electronic trading. In November 2000, BridgeDFS listed on the Australian Stock Exchange as BIS.ASX. and in October 2001, BridgeDFS changed its name to Iress Market Technology Limited (Iress).

Over the next decade, Iress expanded from a predominantly Australian operation, into a global technology business through a string of acquisitions. The company continued to evolve and expand to serve multiple client segments internationally. It faced a range of competitors, and its software services incorporated global technology trends and financial services regulatory influences.
