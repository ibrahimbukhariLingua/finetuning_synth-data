## History

As the company took on larger and larger projects, they became a contractor for used and surplus equipment which they relocated, sold and leased to third parties. In the late 1990s, Portek offered investment of their equipment in exchange for equity in the ports. Thus forming their evolution into port operations as a key business operation.
