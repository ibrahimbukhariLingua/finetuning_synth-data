# Nsite Software



**Nsite** (a.k.a. nsite.com, Nsite Software) was a platform as a service company based in the Bay area, specializing in Sales Force enhancements. Although several pre-built applications were offered on the platform, the most promising part of Nsite was the ability for a customer to use the product to develop their own application using a simple Internet-based interface. Since 2006, it has been a part of SAP Business Objects. The company claimed more than 27,000 customers worldwide when acquired by SAP Business Objects in November 2006. Its flagship product is the subscription-based Nsite platform, with components that provide quote to proposal, order management, and a custom development platform with an AJAX front-end and a MS-SQL backend.
