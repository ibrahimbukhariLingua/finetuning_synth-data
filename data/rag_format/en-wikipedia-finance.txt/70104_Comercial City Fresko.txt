## Formats

As announced, the company indicates that it will have 54 units.


### La Comer

In 2016, the **La Comer** format was created, arising from the purchase of Comercial Mexicana from Soriana, in which the format is the re-founding of the new company through some branches of Comercial Mexicana, MEGA and Bodega Comercial Mexicana retained by Grupo La Comer.

This format is conceptualized on the basis of a hypermarket from 4,000 m² (43,000 sq ft) to 11,000 m² (120,000 sq ft) of sales floor. They are hypermarkets that are focused on consumers located in cities from 100,000 inhabitants onwards, in which they manage divisions of departments such as groceries, perishables, prepared foods, gourmet foods, general merchandise and household items.
