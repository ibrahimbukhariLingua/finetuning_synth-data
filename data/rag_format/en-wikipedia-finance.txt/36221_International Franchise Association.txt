International Franchise Association


# International Franchise Association



The **International Franchise Association** **(IFA)** is a trade group focused on government and public relations efforts for the franchise industry. The association publishes data on franchise activity through a partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau and has litigated on behalf of its members in cases that have reached the U.S. Supreme Court.


## History

IFA was originally founded in Chicago in 1961 by Dunkin' Donuts founder Bill Rosenberg and other business owners.


## Lobbying activities

IFA lobbies in local, state and federal workforce issues such as minimum wage increases, employee classifications and health care legislation. In 2015, the IFA filed suit against the city of Seattle to combat the city's planned minimum wage increase. The case proceeded to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Seattle.

The Center for Media and Democracy consider IFA to be a source of pro-business lobbying activity on behalf of other groups such as ALEC and the Koch Brothers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
