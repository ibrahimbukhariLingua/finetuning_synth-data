# ContourGlobal



**ContourGlobal plc** is a British power generation business. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by KKR in December 2022.


## History

The company was established by Joseph Brandt with financial support from Reservoir Capital Group in 2005. In June 2015 it purchased the Vorotan Cascade in Armenia for US$180 million. ContourGlobal was the subject of an initial public offering which raised net proceeds of £281 million in November 2017. It then agreed to acquire Acciona's solar power plants for US$1.19 billion in February 2018.

In May 2022, the board accepted an offer from KKR which valued the company at £1.75 billion. It was announced on 16 December 2022 that the court had approved the takeover, allowing the transaction to be completed.


## Operations

The company generates circa 59% of its power from fossil fuel sources such as natural gas and coal and circa 41% from renewable sources such as wind, solar and water. It owns and operates 69 power generation plants across 19 countries.
