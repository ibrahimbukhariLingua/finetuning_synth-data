AstraQom was founded in 2008 as AstraQom Corporation. In 2009, AstraQom Corp amalgamated with Aon Communications (Canada) Inc., a network development provider based in Ottawa.

In August 2011, the company moved its headquarters to Ottawa, Ontario to consolidate its Canadian offices and establish a headquarters.
