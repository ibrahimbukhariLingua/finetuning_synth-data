# RBC Records



**RBC Records** is an American online independent record label and management company founded by partners Brian Shafton and Bob Grossi. It provides artists and independent labels with a full-service "virtual label" alternative to signing with a major label. RBC provides distribution, sales, marketing, online publicity, radio promotion, video promotion, product management, and creative services consulting to artists and management. The company announced in 2013 that it would start producing and distributing films under the name RBC Films.

In September 2018, BMG Rights Management acquired RBC for an undisclosed fee.
