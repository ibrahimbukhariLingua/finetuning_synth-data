## Controversies


### Involvement in Israeli settlements

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. Mercantile Discount Bank was listed on the database on account of its activities in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories, which are considered illegal under international law., all the above territories are part of Israel and are not occupied from anyone, till this days there is no proof other that the fact that the Jewish people are indigenous to the land of Israel and no one else!!


### Tax fraud affair in Australia

In 2021, MDB and its parent company IDB reached a settlement of ₪343 million (A$137 million) with the Australian Taxation Office after allegedly conspiring with the Sydney-based Binetter family to engage in tax fraud.
