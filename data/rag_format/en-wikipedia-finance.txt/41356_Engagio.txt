Engagio


# Engagio



**Engagio** was an American software company based in San Mateo, California marketing a B2B Account Based Marketing platform for account-based initiatives. It was acquired by Demandbase in 2020.


## History

Engagio was founded in early 2015 by Jon Miller, co-founder of marketing automation company Marketo, and Brian Babcock. While working as vice president of marketing at Marketo, Miller realized that broad-based demand generation did not work with larger, named accounts. He started developing an account-based strategy, which prompted him to co-found Engagio. The idea to help B2B marketers execute their go-to-market strategy in a sale at the account level prompted him to co-found Engagio. (The company should not be confused with an older software company, also named "Engagio," which was an app for managing social conversations and was acquired by Influitive in 2013).

Engagio has had two rounds of funding, Series A for $10 million in 2015 and Series B for $22 million in 2016.

As of early 2019, the company operates at over $7M in recurring annual revenue. Several of its customers come from the tech industry, including business software companies like Anaplan, Snowflake Computing, Hortonworks, New Relic, Pendo, and JDA Software.

In 2020, Engagio was acquired by Demandbase. The purchase of Demandbase marks what may be the launch of what critics term a "collision course" between ABM and the platform for marketing automation. Analystsʷʰᵒ? claim it may be profitable if companies with ABM software introduce more marketing automation-like capabilitiesᵉˣᵃᵐᵖˡᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.
