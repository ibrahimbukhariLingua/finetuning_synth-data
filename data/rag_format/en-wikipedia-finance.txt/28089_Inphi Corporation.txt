## History

Inphi was founded in 2000 by Gopal Raghavan, Tim Semones and Loi Nguyen to provide high-speed analog, DSP, and optical semiconductor solutions for the cloud and service provider communication markets. On July 30, 2014, Inphi completed the acquisition of Cortina Systems, Inc., in a transaction valued at $131 million including its High-Speed Interconnect and Optical Transport product lines. On August 4, 2016, Inphi completed the sale of its memory product business to Rambus Inc. for $90 million in cash. In December 2016 they acquired ClariPhy Communications, Inc. for $277 million in cash. On November 11, 2019, Inphi and Synopsys announced the acquisition of eSilicon. As part of the acquisition, Inphi paid $216 million, in both cash and the assumption of debt for eSilicon. This added 2.5D packaging, SerDes and custom silicon design products to the Inphi Portfolio. In February 2020, Inphi announced the world's first 800 Gbps PAM4 electro-optics platform.

In October 2020, Marvell Technology, Inc. announced it would acquire Inphi for $8.2 billion. The acquisition completed in April 2021.
