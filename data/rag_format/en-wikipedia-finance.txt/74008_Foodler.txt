# Foodler



**Foodler Inc.** was an American online food ordering service that connected consumers with a wide variety of restaurants for immediate delivery. The company’s website, www.foodler.com, ranked restaurants according to consumer feedback with recommendations based on order history, user ratings, discounts, and free delivery. Users could rank specific dishes. Foodler also remembered users’ favorite foods, addresses, payment, and tip preferences to speed up the ordering process.


## Overview

As of May 2017, the company had generated food sales of over $500 million. In June 2017, Foodler agreed to be acquired by once competitor GrubHub, after GrubHub itself was privately acquired and began to buy competitors before launching it's IPO and press release of the acquisitions and goal of becoming a house hold name for food delivery. On October 17, 2017, the Foodler website shut down and all orders migrated to GrubHub.

Delivery via Foodler was available from more than 12,000 restaurants in 48 states across the US. The company had more than 1,200 restaurants available on its platform within the Boston area.
