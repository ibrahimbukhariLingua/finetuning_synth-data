## Work experience

Before her employment by NSSF Uganda, in March 2011, she worked as head of the Directorate of Management, in Her Majesty's Treasury in the United Kingdom. She served as deputy managing director of NSSF Uganda from 20 March 2011 until 31 December 2013. On that day the employment contract of Richard Byarugaba, the managing director expired and was not immediately renewed. Busuulwa was promoted to acting managing director (MD) while a search for a substantive MD was conducted. After a ten-month search, Byarugaba was re-appointed to his former post and Busuulwa was reappointed as his deputy.

In October 2017, the then Uganda Minister of Finance, Matia Kasaija, declined to renew Geraldine Busuulwa's contract, following the board's recommendation. The board cited "less-than-satisfactory performance", during her tenure. She was replaced by Patrick Ayota, previously the Head of Finance at NSSF Uganda, from 2010 until 2017.
