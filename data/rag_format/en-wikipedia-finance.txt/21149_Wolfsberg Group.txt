Wolfsberg Group


# Wolfsberg Group



The **Wolfsberg Group** is an association of 12 global banks which aims to develop frameworks and guidance for the management of financial crime risks.

It started as a meeting of banks in 1999 who adopted a number of best practice standards under the name Wolfsberg Principles. On 22 September 2021 the association under Swiss law under the name "The Wolfsberg Group" was founded in Basel.

The Wolfsberg Group's goal has been to develop financial industry standards in the private sector for anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) and counter terrorist financing (CTF) policies. Its work is similar to what the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) does on a government level.

In addition to its AML-activities, the Wolfsberg Group also serves as a collective action group in the field of anti-corruption.

Wolfsberg’s publications are aimed at supervisors and regulators with the intention of highlighting best practices and at other financial institutions who can choose to adopt the approaches set out in the publications and thereby improve the overall standard of financial crime risk management across the global financial services industry.

The group operates under the Chatham House Rule.


## History

In 1999, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations called Citigroup's chief executive officer, John Reed, to testify in a public hearing on what the chairman of the Committee, Senator Carl Levin, called a "rogues gallery" of clients at Citibank's private bank. Mr. Reed turned to the new head of the Private Bank, Shaukat Aziz (later to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan) to take actions to both resolve allegations and ensure against future such events.

Mr. Aziz in New York called Frank Vogl, then vice chairman of the board of directors of Transparency International (based in Washington DC), to discuss a joint initiative. They met and Mr. Aziz explained it would be more credible if Transparency International, rather than Citi, invited other leading banks to join Citi in exploring efforts to attain voluntary understandings by major banks to full enforce know-your-customer standards.

A dinner was then organized in New York at Citi, co-hosted by Mr. Aziz and Mr. Vogl, was attended by representatives in New York of major banks, as well as then TI chairman Peter Eigen and then TI-USA board chairman Fritz Heimann. That meeting initiated discussions, led by Mr. Aziz and by the then chief risk officer, Hans-Peter Bauer of UBS in Switzerland.

A meeting was convened at UBS's training center at Schloss Wolfsberg, near Ermatingen in Switzerland. The venue provided the name for the group.

Work proceeded by representatives of the banks and by Jermyn Brooks, a senior executive at Transparency International, which resulted in the first formulation of the Wolfsberg AML Principles for Private Banking. There were originally eight banks, and except for the US and Switzerland, most countries were represented by their largest private bank. Later "a major US investment bank, a large bank from Japan, and a Spanish bank" joined for the original eleven member-group.

In 2000, the Wolfsberg Group was an informal association of the following eleven global banks: Banco Santander, MUFG, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, Société Générale and UBS.

After the September 11 attacks of 2001, the group changed its focus to include counter terrorist-financing standards.

On 22 September 2021 the previously loosely associated group of banks founded an association under Swiss law under the name "The Wolfsberg Group" with registered domicile in Basel, Switzerland.

In May 2022, in the context of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the group suggested banks screen their bank customers for negative news stories, in order to assess their financial crime risk. Dow Jones News Service criticized the document as it did not address the importance of using licensed media in assessing the credibility of negative news media sources identified on the internet.
