Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone


# Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone



**Chabahar Free Trade–Industrial Zone (CFZ)** (Persian: منطقه آزاد تجاری-صنعتی چابهار) is an Iranian free trade zone formed according to the law on the establishment and administration of free trade–industrial zones .

Chabahar free trade–industrial zone was established in 1992 along with the two other free trade zones Qeshm and Kish Island to use global expertise (mostly from South East Asia) as a tool for the development of the country, accelerating the accomplishment of infrastructure, creation of employment, and representation in global markets.


## Main activities

The Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone commenced its operations in 1995, with a primary focus on five major areas: the transit of merchandise goods, investment attraction and related services, tourism, construction and urban development, and education. These activities are overseen by the Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone Organization, which is under public control.


## May 2016 agreements between Iran and India

After overseeing a series of agreements intending to develop the Port of Chabahar, India's Highways and Shipping Minister, Nitin Gadkari suggested that the Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone had the potential to attract upwards of $15 billion worth of investment in the future, although he stated that such investments are predicated upon Iran offering India natural gas at a rate of $1.50 per million British Thermal Units, which is substantially lower than the rate of $2.95 per million British Thermal Units offered by Iran. The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the possibility of setting up an aluminum smelter at a cost of $2 billion,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ as well as establishing a urea processing facility in Chahbahar, although these investments are also contingent upon Iran supplying low-cost natural gas for operation of those facilities.
