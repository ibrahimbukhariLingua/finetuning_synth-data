## Acquisition

On 31 October 2019 the Business Daily Africa newspaper reported that Access Bank Nigeria, had received regulatory approval from the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) to acquire 93.57 percent in Transnational Bank of Kenya. The transaction had yet to receive the approval of the Central Bank of Kenya, as of October 2019.

In January 2020, the Central Bank of Kenya gave approval for Access Bank Group to acquire up to 100 percent shareholding in Transnational Bank. In August 2020, the take-over was consummated after the new owners paid KES:1.4 billion (approx. US$13 million) to buy-out the previous shareholders. The bank re-branded to Access Bank (Kenya) PLC.


## Aborted merger

When the deal by Access Bank Group to acquire Sidian Bank is concluded, it is expected that the new acquisition will be merged into Access Bank Kenya. When that happens, the combined bank is expected to have assets valued at over KSh57.1 billion (approx. US$492 million), with loans totaling KSh26.6 billion (approx. US$229 million). The deal requires regulatory approval in Kenya and Nigeria.

In January 2023, Centum Investment Company Plc. called off the planned sale of the 83.4 percent shareholding that it owns in Sidian Bank to Access Bank Group. The time allocated to negotiations lapsed before agreement could be reached.
