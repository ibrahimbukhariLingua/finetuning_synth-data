## Controversy

In 2012, Lynch was accused of falsifying his doctorate, with an article alleging he claimed dates for a Masters in Philosophy that was not correct and for a PhD that he had not yet completed. Lynch resigned one day after the story broke in the national press. Another article that followed the controversy noted that the Penn website did not list his degrees, only that on one Penn website he was referred to as "Dr." Lynch, and in another article, it notes that he claimed he was "trained in economics" rather than having a doctorate. The Penn press release at the time of his hire, did not mention either degree but rather that he was enrolled in a doctoral program. The controversy continued a year later, where another article claimed that he continued to fake his degrees. However, the Columbia University website at the time of the article did listed him as having a PhD and with a dissertation in economics that focused on the value of diversity.
