# Beaverbrooks



**Beaverbrooks** is a British jeweller. Established in 1919, with the opening of its first shop in Belfast, it is still a family-owned business, with direct descendants of the founders (the third and fourth generations of the Adlestone family) the present day custodians. The current Managing Director, Anna Blackburn, has worked for Beaverbrooks for 21 years, starting her career working in the Trafford branch and working her way up the ranks. She was appointed CEO in September 2013, becoming not only the first female CEO of the company but the first non-family CEO in the company's history. In 2018, Anna was appointed managing director, becoming only the second-ever non-family member to sit on the board.
