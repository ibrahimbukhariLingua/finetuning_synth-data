**Arizent**, formerly known as **SourceMedia**, is a diversified business-to-business digital media company owned by Observer Capital, which acquired the company from Investcorp in August 2014. Formerly the Thomson Media division of The Thomson Corporation, SourceMedia was spun off and sold by Thomson to Investcorp in 2004 for $350 million.


## Headquarters

Based in New York City, SourceMedia has offices in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Virginia and Atlanta.

In 2009, Investcorp split the company into two, creating Accuity as a semi-autonomous unit within SourceMedia. Accuity was the Registrar of Routing Numbers for the American Bankers Association, responsible for the assignment of routing numbers for banks in the United States, and was a leading worldwide provider of payment routing data, software and services. In 2011, Accuity was sold to Reed Elsevier for $530 million.

In February 2012, SourceMedia announced the adoption of a new company logo. The company's "new trademark icon depicts an array of screen-shaped pixels assembled in the shape of a three-dimensional hub."

In September 2012, it was reported that Investcorp would be selling the remainder of SourceMedia. In 2014, SourceMedia was sold to Observer Capital. This is the first major acquisition for Observer Capital, which was founded in 2013 by Joseph Meyer.
