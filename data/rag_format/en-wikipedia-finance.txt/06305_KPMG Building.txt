KPMG Building


# KPMG Building



The **KPMG Building** is a 25-story, 100 m (330 ft) Class A office building located at 55 Second Street in the Financial District of San Francisco, California, designed by Heller Manus, and completed in 2002.


## History

When the building was first proposed by Jaymont Properties in 1989, the project was called **One Second Street**. The development was slowed by the early 1990s recession in the United States but was eventually approved in February 1998.

In November 1999, Jaymont sold the development site to a partnership of Cousins Properties Inc. and Myers Development Company for US$22 million. Groundbreaking took place in May 2000 and the building was completed in March 2002.

In September 2004, Cousins/Myers sold the building to an affiliate of Hines Interests Limited Partnership for US$146.4 million.

Like many other buildings in the area, 55 Second Street contains a public space, described by the San Francisco Chronicle as "a big room with hardwood floors, skylights and grand leather chairs, like a private club", which is located on a mezzanine level.
