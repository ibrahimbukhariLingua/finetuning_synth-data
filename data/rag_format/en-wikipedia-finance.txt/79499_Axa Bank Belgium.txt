# Axa Bank Belgium



**Axa Bank Belgium,** located in Antwerp Belgium, is Axa Group’s banking arm providing retail banking to individuals, and small companies locally. The bank also cooperates with Axa’s local insurance company.


## History

In June 2007, Axa Group’s management board decided to adopt a common European banking strategy. This led to the creation of a European banking head-office in Brussels, Axa Bank Europe, using the former Axa Bank Belgium’s legal structure.

In 2008, Axa Life Europe Hedging Services joined AXA Bank Europe to provide financial engineering competencies to the insurance companies of the group and Axa Bank Europe.

In 2009, the Hungarian Ella Bank became a branch of AXA Bank Europe. The same year, a branch was launched in Switzerland and one year later, in the Czech Republic. Another branch was launched in Slovakia in 2011.

In 2014, a transformation plan was launched to re-focus on the Belgian retail market. Since summer 2015, all teams from Axa Bank Europe have been working from the former Anhyp building in Berchem, Antwerp (Grotesteenweg 214).

In June 2017, Axa Bank Europe changed its name back to Axa Bank Belgium.

In October 2019, the Axa Group sold Axa Bank Belgium to Crelan for €620 million (US$688.51 million).

On January 1 2021, activities in Switzerland were transferred to ZweiPlus Bank.

In Dec 2021, Axa closes the deal to sell the bank to Crelan and acquires the insurance firm.


## Governance

Axa Bank Belgium's strategic decisions are taken by its board of directors, headed by Jef Van In and managed through its management board, headed by Peter Devlies.
