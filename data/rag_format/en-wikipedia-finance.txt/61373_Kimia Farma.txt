## Controversies

In May 2021, a local Medan manager and four other employees working for Kimia Farma were arrested for washing and reusing COVID-19 nasal cotton swabs up to 20,000 times on 9,000 passengers flying through Kualanamu International Airport since December 2020. The workers were suspected to have pocketed as much as 1.8 billion Indonesian rupiah (~$125,000 USD), some of which allegedly went toward a lavish house for one of the suspects. While Kimia Farma has fired the employees-in-question, two human rights lawyers, Ranto Sibarani and Kamal Pane, who were frequent fliers during the time period, have filed a lawsuit against the firm, seeking damages of Rp. 1 billion (~$69,000 USD) per affected passenger.
