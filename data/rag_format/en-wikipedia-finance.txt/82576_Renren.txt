Renren


# Renren



The **Renren Network** (Chinese: 人人网; pinyin: *Rénrénwǎng*; lit. 'Everyone's Network'), formerly known as the **Xiaonei Network** (Chinese: 校内网; pinyin: *Xiàonèiwǎng*; lit. 'on-campus network'), was a Chinese social networking service similar to Facebook. It was popular among college students. Renren Inc. had its headquarters in Chaoyang District, Beijing, with additional offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Renren at one point had a $740m initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2011.


## History

Renren, which started as Xiaonei.com, was founded by a group of students, including Wang Xing, Wang Huiwen and Lai Binqiang at Tsinghua University and Tianjin University in December 2005. Joseph Chen, who had himself tried to launch a student community website called ChinaRen as early as 1999 and sold it in 2000, acquired Xiaonei through his new company Oak Pacific in October 2006.

Born in 1970 in China, Chen moved with his family to the US where he studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later earned an MBA from Stanford University.

In March 2008, Xiaonei launched its WAP version, which users can access through mobile phones. Xiaonei features an instant messaging service (Rénrénzhuōmiàn, Chinese: 人人桌面) designed typically for its users using XMPP, which is more popular than Facebook chat.

Initially, users were only able to use the site from specific IP addresses belonging to colleges. This was done to encourage users to use their real identities on the service. In August 2009, Xiaonei officially changed its name to Renren, as well as its domain to www.renren.com. And also, the logo has changed from the Chinese word "xiaonei" to the Chinese word "renren"("ren", meaning "people" or "person", and "everyone" when used twice in a row). This name change from 'inside the school' (Xiaonei 校内) to 'everybody' (renren 人人) reflected the expansion aspirations held by Oak Pacific – to be more than a network dedicated to students, but instead be the biggest Chinese social network website.

In April 2011, the company filed with the SEC to raise $584 million in a US IPO, offering Renren stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The company reported 2010 revenue of US$76 million. In April 2020, Renren received a non-complicance letter from the New York Stock Exchange, and ultimately delisted in approximately December 2022.

The site began displaying reduced functionality in approximately September 2022, with for example no means of creating a new account for those who do not already have one, and the links to various sub-pages like "Renren Music" or "Renren Video" leading to empty placeholder pages. Finally, in December 2024 the site was taken down altogether for an unspecified "update." The lack of any advance warning that the site was being brought down, possibly forever, led to a degree of outrage from users who had not backed up photos and other sentimentally valuable content stored on their accounts.


## Corporate affairs

Renren Inc. has its headquarters on the 23rd floor of the Jing An Center (S: 静安中心, T: 靜安中心, P: *Jìng'ān Zhōngxīn*) in Chaoyang District, Beijing. Renren has its Shanghai office in the SOHO Zhong Shan Square (S: SOHO中山广场, T: SOHO中山廣場, P: *SOHO Zhōngshān Guǎngchǎng*) in Changning District, Shanghai. Renren has its Guangzhou office in the China Shine Plaza (S: 耀中广场, T: 耀中廣場, P: *Yàozhōng Guǎngchǎng*) in Tianhe District, Guangzhou.

In February 2011, Renren made a pre-IPO announcement that it had 160 million registered users. Later, in April 2011, it had to update its statement accurately to "a total of 31 million active monthly users."


## Open platform

In July 2007, Xiaonei officially facilitated its open platform, allowing third parties to integrate with platform by rendering modifications and adding functionalities. The APIs Xiaonei listed are quite similar with those Facebook provided, and some of Xiaonei's developers are developing based on the SDK of Facebook.


## Privacy policy

Renren has a privacy policy to preserve personal information. Different privacy levels for profile, contact info and blogs can be modified in the privacy settings, thus others that fail to match the privacy requirements cannot browse the specific information or contents of a given user.

In April 2008, SoftBank bought a 14% share of Xiaonei, becoming its largest shareholder. As a result, a rumor came out that “the personal data of millions of Chinese college students on Xiaonei will be exposed to the Japanese since the Japanese company became the boss of Xiaonei". Soon, such claim was spread all over various popular forums, QQ groups, and social networking sites like Xiaonei. Later, Xiaonei declared the denouncement towards its rivals for slander and denied what had been described in the rumor.
