On January 7, 2005, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the **President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform**, a bipartisan panel to advise on options to reform the United States income tax code to make it simpler, fairer, and more pro-growth to benefit all Americans.


## Origins

The task force was created by the President's Executive Order 13369, amended by subsequent orders 13379 and 13386.


## Report

On November 1, 2005, the Advisory Panel submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury a report containing revenue-neutral policy options for reforming the Federal Internal Revenue Code. The options are meant to:

* simplify Federal tax laws to reduce the costs and administrative burdens of compliance with such laws;
* share the burdens and benefits of the Federal tax structure in an appropriately progressive manner while recognizing the importance of homeownership and charity in American society; and
* promote long-run economic growth and job creation, and better encourage work effort, saving, and investment, so as to strengthen the competitiveness of the United States in the global marketplace.

## Members

Panel members included:

* Connie Mack III, Chairman
* John Breaux, Vice-Chairman
* William E. Frenzel
* Elizabeth Garrett
* Edward P. Lazear
* Timothy J. Muris
* James M. Poterba
