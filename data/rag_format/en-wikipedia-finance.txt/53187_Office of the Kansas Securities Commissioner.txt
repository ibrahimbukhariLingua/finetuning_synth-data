Office of the Kansas Securities Commissioner


# Office of the Kansas Securities Commissioner



**Office of the Kansas Securities Commissioner** is a division of the Kansas Insurance Department. The mission of the Office of the Kansas Securities Commissioner (KSC) is to protect and inform Kansas investors, to promote integrity and full disclosure by issuers and securities professionals, to investigate and prosecute fraud and to foster capital formation.

The Securities Commissioner administers the Kansas Uniform Securities Act, the Uniform Land Sales Practices Act, and the Loan Brokers Act. The Commissioner enforces these laws through administrative, civil and criminal proceedings.


## History

In 1911, Kansas became the first state to pass a law regulating the sale of investments. Lawmakers stated that the law was an attempt to prevent the sale of securities which had nothing behind them other than the "blue sky". In the next few years, over 30 states passed similar laws.

Following the great stock market crash of 1929, the federal government began to regulate investment activity with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and the creation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934.

In 2011, the KSC and other state securities regulators celebrated the 100th (Centennial) Anniversary of the “Blue Sky” law.


## Leadership
