WorldMark by Wyndham


# WorldMark by Wyndham



**WorldMark by Wyndham** (formerly **Trendwest**) is the developer and marketer of *WorldMark, The Club*, a vacation ownership program. Worldmark by Wyndham is part of the Travel + Leisure Co. family of travel brands (Formerly **Wyndham Worldwide and Wyndham Destinations**). The original development partner of *the club* was Trendwest International (TWI), a subsidiary of Jeld-Wen, a door and window manufacturer.

Worldmark by Wyndham (WbW), which does not own *WorldMark, the club* (WMtC or "the Club"), has a dual role for the club. First, WbW develops new properties for the club and sells vacation credits for these properties at a profit. Additionally, WbW manages existing WMtC resort properties, the funds for which come from annual maintenance dues commensurate with the number of vacation credits each WMtC owner's account contains.

WorldMark by Wyndham operates nearly 100 vacation club properties across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
