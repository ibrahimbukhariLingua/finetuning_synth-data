## History

The company was founded in 1831 in Zug as a hardware store by Franz Kaspar Bossard-Kolin. The earlier silk trading business inherited from his father-in-law was dissolved at the same time. The hardware store kept its local character for roughly a century before the company expanded its business activities in the 1930s and 1940s to trading fasteners. The local specialized store first developed into a regional, and from the 1950s on, into a national company. In the 1960s, Bossard began to set up and expand an international network of bases. In the course of this expansion, the company went public on the stock market in 1987. The recession at the beginning of the 1990s and the associated worsening business trend led Bossard to a review of the entire organization. In doing so, the company focused on the core competence of fastening technology and the gradual selling off of all its tools, fittings and handicraft units. Bossard today is active in the field of fastening technology in Europe, America and Asia.

In November 2012, the Bossard group acquired the KVT Koenig Group's range of fastening technology. At the beginning of 2019, Bossard Group acquired BRUMA Schraub- und Drehtechnik GmbH in Velbert. On June 24, 2019, the company also acquired the distribution business of SACS Boysen Aerospace Group, which continues to operate under the Boysen name. Bossard Group also increased its majority stake in Torp Fasteners, based in Oslo, Norway, from 60% to 100% at the beginning of 2020. Bossard has held a stake in the company, which specializes in high-quality fasteners, since January 2015. In December 2020 Bossard acquired shares in MultiMaterial-Welding GmbH, thus expanding its portfolio to include pioneering lightweight fastening solutions.ᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ In October 2021, Bossard Group acquired the Dutch company Jeveka B.V., thus substantially expanding its presence in the Benelux countries.
