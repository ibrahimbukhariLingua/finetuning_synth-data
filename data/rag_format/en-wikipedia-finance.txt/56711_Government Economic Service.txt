# Government Economic Service



The **Government Economic Service** (GES) is a professional grouping of public sector economists who work across some 40 departments and agencies of His Majesty's Government (HMG). The GES Board is chaired by the Head of the GES and consists of government chief economists and directors of analysis. GES was founded in 1964 by Sir Alec Cairncross. The GES recruits economists on behalf of the departments and is the largest recruiter of economists in the UK.

Professional support for the GES, and since 2010ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ also for the Government Social Research profession, is provided by the Government Economic and Social Research Team, located at HM Treasury.
