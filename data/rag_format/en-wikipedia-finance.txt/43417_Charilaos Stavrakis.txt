## European Debt Crisis

In his 2009 opening speech at the ceremony of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Annual meeting in Limassol, Stavrakis stated that the impact of the crisis on the real economy has become evident in 2009 with the second half of 2009 proving to be particularly challenging. The Government of Cyprus responded to the crisis with a Strategic Plan of around EUR 350 million (close to 2% of GDP). In the same year president Demetris Christofias publicly vetoed spending cuts decided by Charilaos Stavrakis and a year or so later publicly denounced measures agreed by Kikis Kazamias with the opposition parties.
