***Økonomisk Rapport*** (Danish: *Financial Report*) was a monthly business magazine published in Oslo, Norway. The magazine was in circulation between 1974 and January 2013.


## History and profile

The magazine was founded in 1974. Previously owned by Fora Medier, the magazine was based in Oslo. Although it was not originally started as a business publication, the magazine was redesigned as a business-oriented publication when Hjemmet Mortensen acquired it. In 2002 Hjemmet Mortensen sold the magazine to a group of investors. In 2006 Media House Vårt Land or Mentor Media came in as a major shareholder of the magazine. Ivar Hippe was the editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1999 to 2002. Another editor-in-chief was Terje Aurdal.

At the beginning of 2013 the magazine together with its sister publications *Kultmag* and *Mandag Morgen* was sold by Mentor Media to Magne Lerø. In late January 2013 Magne Lerø announced that *Økonomisk Rapport* would be closed.

The magazine sold 24,946 copies in 2000 and 24,000 copies in 2002.
