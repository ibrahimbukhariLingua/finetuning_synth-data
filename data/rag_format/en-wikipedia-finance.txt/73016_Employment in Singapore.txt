## Legislation

Basic terms and conditions of employers-employees relations in Singapore are covered by law in the Employment Act. All employees, both Singaporeans and foreigners, who enter into a contract of service with employers are covered by the act. There are some exceptions for managers and executives, who are not covered by Part IV, which provides for rest days, hours of work, annual leave and other conditions of service. For managers and executives, these conditions vary according to what is agreed in their individual employment contract. Workforce Singapore, a statute board under the ministry, also launched the Adapt and Grow Initiative in 2016. The program helps match individuals to career opportunities, with 17,000 matchings in the first half of 2018.
