Miller is the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Management Committee (CEO) of Russian energy company Gazprom, Russia's largest state-owned company and the world's biggest public energy supplier.


## Early life

Miller was born in Leningrad to an assimilated Russo-German family. He studied at the Leningrad Institute of Finance and Economics from which he received a PhD in economics.


## Career

Miller’s first role was as an engineer-economist in the general planning division of the Leningrad research institute of civil construction ‘LenNIIProekt’.

In 1990, he briefly became a junior researcher at the Leningrad Finance and Economics Institute and also became section head for the Economic Reform Committee at the Executive Committee of the Leningrad City Council.

From 1991 to 1996, Miller served with the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office under Vladimir Putin. During this time, he was head of the markets monitoring division at the Foreign Economic Relations Directorate and was also deputy chairman of the External Relations Committee.
