Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement


# Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement



The **Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA)** is a proposed diplomatic arrangement that seeks to add to the existing free trade agreement between the Republic of India and the Republic of Sri Lanka, primarily in relation to trade-in services and the service sector; it seeks to emulate a proto freedom-of-movement system and a single market.

The proposal is championed by supporters as a method to introduce low-cost goods for low-income people in Sri Lanka and increase sales of high-end goods to India, while also making Sri Lanka more attractive for FDI. But many lobby groups have become concerned that India would flood Sri Lanka with cheaper labor, with the IT industry in particular worried about the influx of cheaper Indian tech workers. The high unemployment rate of India has been pointed out by many nationalist groups. Sri Lanka expresses its gratitude to India for preventing a potential catastrophe and preserving peace.

The proposed agreement's impact has been estimated to be an increase of $500 billion to the common economy. It has been likened to the economic union undertaken between the North-East Asian countries of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China called the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, and both agreements share issues with the island nation's people worrying about being undercut by cheaper laborers from the mainland.

## Reactions

**Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lankan prime minister**: "These five southern states have a population of 250 million and a combined GDP of $450 billion. With an addition of Sri Lanka $80 billion, the GDP in this sub regional economy will cross $500 billion,"

**Indian High Commissioner Y.K. Sinha**: “They state a large number of Indians would come to Sri Lanka including barbers, lawyers and professors even and that they would take over Sri Lanka . . . These claims are amusing and completely untrue,”

**Muhunthan Canagey –CEO of ICTA**: "I would like to really know, do you really think the signing of ETCA will affect IT jobs in Sri Lanka? Are we Sri Lankans so inferior that we are so threatened to ensure doors are to be closed for IT professionals from India to come and join teams in Sri Lanka? Don’t you all think that in a world where software code is being developed all around the world and being delivered through the Internet, protecting IT professionals coming and working face to face with local teams is bad and will destroy us? Anyway, the work can be outsourced online."

**GMOA member Dr. Haritha Aluthge**: “We pointed out the kind of damage that will be posed to the Sri Lankan trade community. We were informed by the minister that they would finalize the ETCA only after reading the facts in the agreement and studying them,”

**Members of the Young Lawyers Circle**: “We also wish to tell the Government to stop signing this agreement which may have a disastrous impact on Sri Lanka’s labour force. According to available details, the Government has been compelled to sign this agreement secretly due to India’s urging. We demand that the government open an intellectual discussion on this agreement. As young lawyers, we demand that the government opens the agreement to the people and consult the professionals,”

**Geethanjali Natraj, professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration**,“Given these states’ proximity to Sri Lanka, the ETCA would leverage Sri Lanka's unique geo-strategic location, which is at the crossroads of major shipping routes. The ETCA would also increase regional integration and could make Sri Lanka the geo-economic centre of South Asia."
