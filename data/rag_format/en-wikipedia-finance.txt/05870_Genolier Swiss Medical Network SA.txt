## History

Five shareholders founded *AGEN Holding SA* in 2002 by taking over Clinique de Genolier, which had been operating in the Vaud municipality of the same name since 1972. In the years that followed, new clinics were continuously integrated into the group in order to create a national network of private healthcare institutions. In 2003, they integrated the Clinique de Montchoisi in Lausanne, VD, which had been founded in 1923. The Clinique Valmont in Glion ob Montreux, VD, founded by Henri-Auguste Widmer in 1905, and the Sainte-Anne and Garcia clinics in Fribourg were integrated in 2005 (the merger of the latter two ultimately resulted in the Clinique Générale Ste-Anne). In 2007, the Centre d'oncologie in Geneva, the only private centre for radio-oncology in the city, was opened.

AGEN Holding changed its name to *Genolier Swiss Medical Network SA* in 2008 and integrated the Centre médico-chirurgical des Eaux-Vives in Geneva the following year and Privatklinik Bethanien in Zurich, founded in 1912, in 2010.

In 2011, Genolier Swiss Medical Network acquired a 49% stake in Privatklinik Lindberg in Winterthur ] and a 20% stake in Klinik Pyramide am See in Zurich. [ ] Privatklinik Obach in Solothurn (founded in 1922), Clinica Ars Medica in Gravesano TI (founded in 1989), Clinica Sant'Anna in Lugano (founded in 1922) and Privatklinik Lindberg were integrated in 2012 and Clinique de Valère in Sion, VS (founded in 1920), Hôpital de la Providence in Neuchâtel (founded in 1859) and Privatklinik Villa im Park in Rothrist (founded in 1984) in 2013. [ This was followed in 2014 by the integration of Schmerzklinik Basel (founded in 1978) and in 2015 by the integration of Clinique Montbrillant in La Chaux-de-Fonds.

After 2015, the company changed its name to *Swiss Medical Network SA* to emphasise its commitment throughout Switzerland. The renowned Clinique Générale-Beaulieu joined the network in 2016 to further promote oncology and radio-oncology in Geneva. In German-speaking Switzerland, the Privatklinik Siloah in Gümligen (BE) followed in 2018, the Rosenklinik Rapperswil in 2019 and the Privatklinik Belair also in 2019.

In January 2020, it was announced that the Government Council of the Canton of Berne was selling 35% of the share capital of the *Hôpital du Jura Bernois* (HJB SA) hospital group to Swiss Medical Network. The hospital group operates the hospitals in Moutier and Saint-Imier, among others. On 30 August 2021, the stake was increased by a further 17% to 52%. The former Hôpital du Jura Bernois was renamed *Réseau de l'Arc*. The first integrated healthcare centre in Switzerland.
