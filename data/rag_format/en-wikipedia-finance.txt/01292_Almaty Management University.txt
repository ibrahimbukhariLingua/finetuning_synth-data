In September 2017 Almaty Management University (AlmaU) opened the Knowledge Building - a new intellectual innovation building.

The new building of AlmaU, built using the latest technology, is probably the most ambitious project in the field of education. Modern infrastructure, including coworking centers, food courts, places for relaxation, conference rooms, modern laboratories, classrooms; beautiful design, versatility, innovation and convenience in everything are the main criteria which the developers of this building of the southern capital were guided by.

On the 1st floor there is Atrium Grand Hall for 600 seats with a huge LED display and professional acoustic and lighting equipment, and a reading room with a book-crossing sector and a cafe with flavorous coffee.

On the 2nd floor there are student classrooms, a relaxation room and 4 laboratories:

“**Petroleum Transportation Lab**” Laboratory of *School of Economics and Logistics* (General sponsor - Petroleum LLP). Creation of “PetroleumTransportLab” laboratory is one of the key steps towards implementation of a number of projects: creation of a transport hub, logistics outsourcing, development of transport services, operator and forwarding business, etc.

**Neuromarketing** Laboratory of *Graduate School of Management* (Magnum Cash and Carry helped to purchase equipment for this laboratory) is equipped with a video camera, microphone and Tobii Glasses 2 mobile eye tracking system, which provides objective data on consumers' perceptions of various trademarks and brands and reveals hidden factors affecting decision making process. Using this technology, it is possible to study the visual perception of consumers when making a purchase decision. The laboratory allows to conduct applied research using neurobiological analysis tools and expert opinions for business. This project has no analogues in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

**The simulation room** of *Center for Mediation* *and Center of Excellence* is equipped with four video cameras, microphones and voice recorders. It is used to resolve disputable situations and conflicts that may arise in the educational process, for example, between a student and a teacher (student and management, employee and manager, etc.). Situations are played in the simulation room, audio and video recording is conducted, which makes it possible to analyze the process. The room is also used for conducting research with participation of focus groups and conducting in-depth interviews with possibility to observe the process from the adjacent sector: whether the methodology is not violated, whether there is no pressure on respondents.

The **oratory workshop** of *Graduate School of State and Public Administration and Law* is a mirror room equipped with a video camera for recording and analyzing the speaker's speeches. A photograph of a listening audience on the wall creates an atmosphere of real-life performance. In the course of trainings, the psychological barrier is overcome, communication and oratorical skills are developed. The workshop is aimed at shaping the culture of public speaking: the conceptual apparatus, wide vocabulary range, techniques of verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as presentation and self-presentation skills.

On the 3rd floor of Knowledge Building there are classrooms of Graduate School of Business equipped with a smart system, in particular, MBA programs and doctoral programs, as well as the classroom of MBA Association, whose accreditation is got by Almaty Management University (AlmaU), the only university in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, in the list of the top 200 best universities in the world.

On the 4th floor there are 3 laboratories:

**DesignLab Laboratory** of *Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation Development*, is equipped with a sound system and a projector, glass boards for design processes, as well as tools and accessories for creating and modeling prototypes. In the process of working in the laboratory, students and trainees perform dozens of practical tasks, simulating prototypes of business processes on their own - this is how fast experience is formed, practicing thinking and various methods of working with the project are applied in order to find their own ways of solving creative problems. The *value of design thinking for business* is that this technique allows to work with “implicit knowledge” of the consumer, which he cannot recognize and tell on his own. That, ultimately, allows you to get products and services that are focused on people.

**Cyber-Polygon "EngEkon"** Laboratory of the *School of Economics and Logistics* (general sponsor is Kazakhstan GIS Center JSC, Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan) is considered to be the brightest laboratory. Its walls are painted in three different colors: red, green and blue, the laboratory is equipped with 4 displays, 7 computers, a projector, an audio system. As planned by the authors of the project, two opposing forces are involved in the simulation: the attacker, occupying the red corner, is trying to make a hole in the system; defenders, sitting opposite the screen in the green zone, use preventive methods to isolate the attack. Each side has 3 computers. The blue zone is the zone of observers, where the overall picture of the unfolding battle between “hackers” and “Information Security” (IS) is visible on the display. The purpose of the cyber-test site is to teach students to counteract cyber-terrorism, preventing hacking of databases and data leakage.

**MediaLab Center for Multimedia Journalism** of *Graduate* *School of State and Public Administration* *and Law* is equipped with a projector, computers and a voice recorder. It is an open working media space operating on the principle of dual education. A feature of the project is the working format of the center: students under the supervision of mentors initiate their own topics independently and in project groups and experiment with the production of various content, as well as learn how to work in social networks and how to create and maintain their own brand. It is important: MediaLab helps not only to students-journalists and PR specialists, but works “at the junction”, teaching economists, financiers, and logisticians to create media content.

On the 5th floor there are administration offices, equipped with smart systems, student classrooms and the meeting room of AlmaU Board of Trustees.

On the 6th floor, visitors will see “SMART-conference hall”, where it is possible to control light, sound, air conditioning, a projector, roll-up curtains from the iPad; Also, guests can view the magnificent panorama of the mountains from the windows of Panorama Hall.

All the laboratories of the new building, whose construction was financed by **Capital Bank Kazakhstan**, are equipped with innovative technologies and work together with the partners of the university - government agencies, business structures, media companies. It is this format that allows the university to implement the principle of Win-Win-Win, according to which any mutually beneficial cooperation between the two parties (Win-Win) should be of benefit to a third party - society (Win). It is also an excellent example of successful implementation of the “triple spiral” theory, the essence of which is in dynamic development of relations between the state, universities and business for effective development of new industries and solving existing problems.

It is worth noting that the new building will be managed in a new way. It is facilitated by the knowledge management system launched at AlmaU. Created to improve university management efficiency, the Knowledge Management System processes large streams of information (BIG DATA), integrates various information systems, and automates business processes.
