## Biography

Bang was born on December 23, 1968 in Seoul, South Korea. He was born into poverty. He claimed that, while he was in elementary school, he delivered newspapers to help support the family. In 1985, he dropped out after attending two years of high school and worked to help support his family. He was reportedly unsuccessful in much of his early career. He also reportedly was once the victim of a scam, and lost all of his money. At age 30, he founded an internet movie rental business, but the business failed. In 1999, founded an internet-related business that was popular but did not recoup its investment costs. Around this time, he heard that the video game developer Ipopsoft (아이팝소프트) was in crisis. While still a company outsider, he helped the company overcome its crisis by finding investors. When the company again went into crisis, he took over the company and reorganized it into Netmarble. Bang then oversaw Netmarble's rapid growth. After several initial successes, the company caught the attention of the conglomerate CJ Group, which agreed to acquire it in 2004. He stepped down from the company in 2006 due to unspecified health concerns (he later claimed to be exhausted), and took a hiatus for five years. He reportedly was attempting to start another gaming company before he was asked to return by CJ.

Upon his return to Netmarble, he shifted the business to focusing on the mobile gaming market. In 2015, Netmarble ranked 8th in app sales globally. In 2016, he owned around 32% of Netmarble stock. In May 2017, Netmarble went public after raising US$2.4 billion, which was the largest listing in the country in seven years. In 2017, he became the richest self-made billionaire in the country and the sixth richest in the country, then holding 24.47% of company stock.

He is reportedly a cousin of Bang Si-hyuk, who would eventually become CEO of Big Hit Entertainment. The two reportedly have collaborated on business ventures that utilized their respective companies' strengths.


## Personal life

He is married to Shin Hye-yeong (신혜영), with whom he has two sons and one daughter.
