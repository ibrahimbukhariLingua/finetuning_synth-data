International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics


# International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics



***Insurance Economics*** is a research programme set up by the Geneva Association, also known as the International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.

It is dedicated to making an original contribution to the progress of insurance through promoting studies of the interdependence between economics and insurance, to highlight the importance of risk and insurance economics as part of the modern general economic theory, to detect and define special aims for research programmes in risk and insurance economics, to stimulate and support academic and professional research work in risk and insurance economics throughout the world, and to diffuse knowledge and the results of research in risk and insurance economics worldwide. The Geneva Association has been the founding institution of the European Group of Risk and Insurance Economists (EGRIE) one of worldwide now three regional organisations that organise (mostly) academic experts in the fields of risk and insurance economics. The Geneva Association is furthermore the catalytical non-academic organisation for the arrangement of the first world congress for risk and insurance economists which was jointly organised by ARIA, APRIA, EGRIE and the Geneva Association in 2005 in Salt Lake City.

The modern world has greatly increased the economic and financial performances and reliability. Conversely, the perception of risks and vulnerabilities - as a consequence of a higher level of knowledge - has increased to the point of producing feelings on insecurity.
