German ostmark


# German ostmark



***Ostmark*** (German: [ˈɔstmaʁk] ) is the name given to a currency denominated in *Mark* which was issued by Germany in 1918 for use in a part of the eastern areas under German control at that time, the *Ober Ost* area. The currency consisted of paper money issued on 4 April 1918 by the *Darlehnskasse* in *Kowno* (Kaunas) and was equal to the German Papiermark. The *Ostmark* circulated alongside the Imperial rouble and the *Ostrubel*, with two *Ostmark* equal to one *Ostrubel*.


## Denominations

The denominations available were:

* 1⁄2 mark;
* 1 mark;
* 2 marks;
* 5 marks;
* 20 marks;
* 50 marks;
* 100 marks;
* 1000 marks.

The reverse sides of the *Darlehnskassenscheine* carry a warning against forging banknotes in German, Latvian and Lithuanian.


## Aftermath

The Ostmark and Ostrubel continued to circulate in Lithuania from the end of World War I until 1 October 1922, when they were replaced by the *litas*. The names *skatikas* and *auksinas* were used for *Pfennig* and *Mark*, for example, on postage stamps. The reason for the replacement was the link to the *Papiermark*, which already suffered from inflation (and would spiral into hyperinflation in 1923). The *litas* was pegged to the U.S. dollar.
