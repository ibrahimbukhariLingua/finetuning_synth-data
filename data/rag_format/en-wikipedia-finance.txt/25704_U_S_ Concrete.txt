## History

From 1999-2001, U.S. Concrete acquired 21 companies and received $35 million in an IPO. From 2002-2003, the company engaged in the aggregates industry and completed 1 tuck-in acquisition. From 2004 onward, it has been engaged in more cross-selling opportunities.

The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 29, 2010. It emerged from bankruptcy on August 31, 2010 after reducing its debt by $272 million.

On October 30, 2012, Central Concrete Supply Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Concrete, completed the acquisition of Bode Gravel Co. and Bode Concrete LLC.

On Dec 17, 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Concrete, Smith Precast, Inc., sold substantially all of its assets for $4.27 million in cash and the assumption of certain obligations by Jensen Enterprises, Inc.

In 2015, U.S. Concrete completed a significant ready-mixed concrete acquisition of Ferrara Bros. Building Materials, in Queens, New York. This acquisition significantly expanded the Company's footprint in New York City and allowed them to serve all five boroughs. In subsequent acquisitions in 2016, USCR completed a series of acquisitions of Jenna Concrete, NYCON Supply Co. and Kings Ready Mix as part of a strategy to strengthen and expand its New York City operations. These acquisitions expanded their ready-mixed concrete operations, adding New York as a major contributor to success.

In 2017, the company completed its largest acquisition to date with the purchase of Polaris Materials, a construction aggregate producer in British Columbia, Canada. Beyond its own traditional regions, they also serve aggregates-only markets in Southern California and Hawaii. Also in 2017, USCR acquired Corbett Aggregate Companies, LLC located in Quinton, New Jersey.

In 2020, U.S. Concrete expanded its aggregates portfolio with the acquisition of Coram Materials, a construction aggregate producer on Long Island, New York.

In June 2021, Vulcan Materials (VMC) announced they would be acquiring U.S. Concrete (USCR) for $74 per share, a 30% premium on the date of the announcement. The deal is valued at $1.3 billion. The acquisition will allow for the integrated expansion of Vulcan and make the subsidiary debt-free with adequate working capital. The deal has been approved by both boards and will close in the second half of 2021.
