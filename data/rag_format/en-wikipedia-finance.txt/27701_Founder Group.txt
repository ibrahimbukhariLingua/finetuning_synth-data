Founder's motto is "世界在变 创新不变" (shì jiè zài biàn, chuàng xīn bu biàn), which roughly translates to "The world is changing; innovation is not". The company is currently moving to establish itself as a computer chip designer. Founder are also owners of the largest mall in the world, New South China Mall, acquired from Dongguan Sanyuan Yinghui Investment & Development which had run the mall extremely poorly.


## History

Founder Group was established in 1986 by Peking University. Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University became Founder's first key person, as the Chinese-character laser phototypesetting system that he invented provided the foundation on which Founder was developed. Wang brought Founder into the television and radio industries, positioned the company to expand overseas, and supported the diversification of the group. By 1989, total orders for the phototypesetting system exceeded 100 million yuan.

Between 1990 and 1994, under the guidance of Wang Xuan, Founder released multiple technologies, including a long-distance newspaper transfer technology, a color desktop publishing system, a computer management system for gathering and editing news, and the new generation of software and hardware systems. Founder's publishing system became the most popular product of its kind, capturing 80% of the Chinese newspaper market in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and North America.

Starting in 1991, Founder started developing Chinese PostScript fonts in Windows.

Throughout the late 1990s, publishing systems developed by Founder's researchers dominated the domestic market. Additionally, they entered the international market, with products being exported to dozens of countries all over the world. In the meantime, Founder Group sold its core technologies with independent intellectual rights to global manufacturers, who then applied these technologies in their products around the world.

In February 2006, professor Wang Xuan died.

In early 2009, the Group established a new three-year development strategy and put forward its development goal to transform itself into a diversified investment holding group.

In 2016 Founder Group sold most of the shares of Founder BEA Trust to Wuhan Financial Holdings Group.

In 2020, the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court ruled out the recognized leader for restructuring five children companies of the group. After three years, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission principally agreed on the bankruptcy of the group's Founder Financial.
