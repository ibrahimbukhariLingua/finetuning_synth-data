United States one-thousand-dollar bill


# United States one-thousand-dollar bill



The **United States 1000 dollar bill** **(US$1000)** is an obsolete denomination of United States currency. It was issued by the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) beginning in 1861 and ending in 1934. Since 1969 Treasury policy is to withdraw any $1000 bills it receives, but it is still legal tender.


## Description

From 1862 to 1880 the US Treasury Department issued $1,000 Legal Tender notes, with three different designs on the obverse. The portrait of Robert Morris appeared on the first 1000 dollar bill. Mayor of New York DeWitt Clinton appeared on two other versions. The obverse of the 1928 and 1934 series features a portrait of Grover Cleveland facing right while toward a United States Department of the Treasury seal.

The reverse of the 1928 and 1934 one-thousand-dollar bills feature lathework and a decorative border. The reverse also contains text that reads: "The United States of America / One Thousand Dollars" and the number 1,000.


## History

The United States one-thousand-dollar bill was printed from 1861 to 1945. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) continued to issue the notes until 1969. The notes did not see much circulation among the public because they were printed to facilitate transactions between banks.

In 1878 and 1880 the Treasury produced the $1,000 bill as a silver certificate. Other subsequent versions were produced in 1878, 1880 and 1891. In 1913, a large-size version of the bill was issued as a Federal Reserve Note. In 1882, the note was issued as a gold certificate. In 1928 the treasury began to issued small-size bills and the $1,000 denomination featured US President Grover Cleveland. The small-size was issued in 1928 and 1934.

Examples of $1000 bills are valued by collectors and they regularly sell for more than their face value. On July 14, 1969, the United States Department of the Treasury announced that all notes in denominations greater than US$100 would be discontinued. Since 1969 banks are required to send any $1000 bill to the Department of the Treasury for destruction. Collectors value the one-thousand-dollar bill with a gold seal.
