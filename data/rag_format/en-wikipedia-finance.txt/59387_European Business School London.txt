# European Business School London



**European Business School London** (EBS London) was a private Business School in Regent's Park in Central London. It was a constituent school of Regent's College London, which became Regent's University London in 2013..

EBS London offered courses in the field of International Business Management and had a strong focus on Banking and Finance, reflected by the fact that a third of its graduates pursued a career in that field. Besides its focus on teaching, the university had a long-standing commitment to research, offering MPhil and PhD degrees.

Around 900 students from over 85 nationalities made the School highly international. It also had as strong focus on languages, with 70% of its graduates being fluent in at least four languages.
EBS has a strong representation of all nations especially Russian, Spanish, Italian and French.


## History

Founded in 1979, European Business School was an international institution with campuses in London, Paris, Frankfurt (Oestrich-Winkel) and Milan which had a pioneering influence on the European model of education. In 1985, though still co-operating and exchanging students, the EBS schools became independent. Each school kept the EBS name but added the city name after. European Business School London (EBSL), EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht and European Business School Paris are the remaining European Business Schools. EBS London was part of the business faculty of Regent's College London until it became Regent's University London in 2013.
