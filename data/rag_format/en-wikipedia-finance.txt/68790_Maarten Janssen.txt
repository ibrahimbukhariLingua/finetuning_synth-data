## Scientific contribution

Janssen's research focus is theoretical industrial economics. In particular, he conducts research on consumer search behavior and auctions, and has made several methodological contributions in the area of consumer search theory. In addition, Janssen has launched a new subfield that studies the effects of consumer search in vertically structured industries. In auction theory, Janssen studies the interaction between the way firms bid in auctions and the way they compete in markets after the auction. This is particularly important in spectrum auctions for mobile telecommunications.

Janssen has served as a visiting professor in Moscow and Paris (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne), as well as in the U.S. (Duke University) and Belgium (Université Catholique de Louvain), among other places. In 2023, he will assume the Distinguished Visiting Austrian Chair Professorship at Stanford University.
