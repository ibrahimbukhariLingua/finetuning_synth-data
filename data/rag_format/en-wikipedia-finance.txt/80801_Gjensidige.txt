## History

Although the company traces its roots back to 1816, the brand name Gjensidige originates from the life insurance company **Christiania almindelige gjensidige fors√∏rgelsesanstalt** that was established in 1847. In the early 1970s the p&c-company traded under the name Samtrygd, whereas the life insurance company had simplified its name to Gjensidige Liv. The two companies formed a strategic alliance in 1976, adopting Gjensidige as a joint brand name, but as both companies were mutually owned they did not merge.

In 1992 Gjensidige acquired Forenede Forsikring and in 1993 Gjensidige Bank was created with banking services. In 1999 Gjensidige and the savings bank Sparebanken NOR created the Gjensidige NOR-group. The Group was a strategic alliance between mutually owned companies. When Gjensidige NOR merged with Den norske Bank in 2003 to form DnB NOR, Gjensidige Forsikring remained an independent company.

In 2007 Gjensidige acquired shares in Storebrand, and for some time held the position as the number one shareholder with 24.33% of the stock. The entire shareholding was sold in 2014.

In 2010 Gjensidige demutualised and was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The Gjensidige Foundation is the largest owner with some 62 percent of the shares.
