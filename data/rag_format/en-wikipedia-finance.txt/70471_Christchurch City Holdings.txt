Christchurch City Holdings


# Christchurch City Holdings



**Christchurch City Holdings** Ltd (**CCHL**) is a wholly owned investment arm of the Christchurch City Council. The council controlled trading organisations (CCTO) own and run some of the important infrastructure in Christchurch, such as the public transport and electricity delivery in the city.


## Organisations owned by CCHL

CCHL owns or part-owns the following eight companies.


### Lyttelton Port Company

The Lyttelton Port Company is the management of the main port in the South Island at Lyttelton, New Zealand. It services the city's businesses as the seaport. By June 2012, CCHL ownership had increased to 79.3%.


### Christchurch International Airport

Christchurch International Airport. 75% owned by CCHL.


### City Care

City Care is the City Council's infrastructure management company. They have branches throughout New Zealand and service many councils and businesses. 100% owned by CCHL. After the collapse of construction company Mainzeal, City Care hired their management team. A decision whether City Care will venture into 'vertical construction' has not yet been made. In November 2015, Christchurch City Council decided to sell City Care. After a sales process left only one offer on the table that was considered insufficient, the city council decided in August 2016 that it would keep City Care. Asset sales is one of the top issues in the 2016 Christchurch mayoral election.


### Orion

Orion is an electricity distribution company, that owns and operates the network in the central Canterbury area. It covers the area between the Waimakariri and Rakaia rivers and from the Canterbury Coast to Arthur's Pass. 89.3% owned by CCHL.


### Selwyn Plantation Board

Selwyn Plantation Board operates in forestry and farming. 39.32% owned by CCHL, but the company is in the process of being wound up (it is selling its assets and the proceeds will be distributed to the two shareholding council holding companies). A final payment to CCHL is expected in 2013.


### Enable Networks

Enable Networks builds and runs a new fibre optic network in Christchurch. Enable Networks was first launched in 2007 with funding from CCHL and a grant from the Ministry of Economic Development. Initially launched as Christchurch City Networks Limited (CCNL), in 2009 the company re-branded as Enable Networks. The company is the Crown's partner for its Ultra-Fast Broadband initiative. 100% owned by CCHL.


### Red Bus

Red Bus is one of the public passenger transport operators in Christchurch. 100% owned by CCHL. On 4 November 2020 it was announced that Red Bus's operations and assets had been sold to Ritchies Transport Holdings Ltd for an undisclosed sum with completion expected in early December.
