After four years, Ibrahim was able to purchase his first shipping vessel, an old fishing boat converted to carry cargo and oil, to facilitate oil imports. By 14 April 1986, Ibrahim's business was registered under the name of Villa Shipping and Trading Company Limited (Villa). Since then, the company has diversified its business, gaining a substantial market share in diverse Maldivian industries including tourism, transport, construction, manufacturing, gas, the cement trade, and media/communication as well as general trading as the sole Maldivian distributor of international products. Shell and Agfa are among the brand names represented by Villa in the Maldives.

The shareholders of the holding company, Villa Shipping & Trading Company Private Limited (VSTC) are Qasim Ibrahim and one of his wife, Rabia Hussain, who respectively hold 95% and 5% of the company's shares.

Ibrahim joined the MDP-led coalition in the second round of the elections and helped Mohamed Nasheed secure a historic victory and bring an end to the thirty-year rule of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Ibrahim initially joined President Nasheed's government as Minister for Home Affairs but resigned 20 days later, citing his dislike of President Nasheed's privatization policies. He became vocally opposed to Nasheed's government and was accused of having funded the anti-Nasheed protests that began in early 2012 that ultimately led to Nasheed's resignation after pressure from police and the army on 7 February 2012.

In 2023, Qasim Ibrahim was selected as the presidential primary for the Jumhooree Party to contest for the 2023 Maldivian presidential election. This time, the Jumhooree Party ran without a coalition, marking the first time. Qasim selected his running mate as Ameen Ibrahim.

## Political activism and imprisonment

Ibrahim has been imprisoned for political reasons both during Gayoom's regime as well as Nasheed's brief reign. He was arrested in 2009 on suspicion that he was bribing MPs to vote against the government of President Nasheed. He was later released without charge. He is currently representing the Maamigili Constituency in the Maldives Parliament.


### Imprisonment

Qasim Ibrahim was arrested for speaking against the government on rally held by the Maldives United Opposition. He was accused of leading a failed bid in March to impeach Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed, a close ally of president Abdulla Yameen.


## Controversies

In September 2008, the Auditor General of the Maldives submitted a report to the People's Majlis which was published on the website of the Auditor General's office. It stated that the Villa Group had been found to be involved in the illicit trading of shares.

In July 2010, State Minister of Finance Ahmed Assad stated in a President's Office Press Briefing that Maldives was facing hurdles in borrowing money internationally because of a specific Majlis member who was borrowing large sums of money and lowering the country's credit rating. It was stated that this Member has made a request to the government to give him a ‘letter of no objection’ to borrow another large sum. Though the Minister refused to name the Majlis member at the conference, it was widely assumed in the Maldivian media that the Majlis member in question was Qasim Ibrahim.

In February 2013, Qasim Ibrahim, as the Parliament's representative to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), accused UN Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges and Lawyers Gabriela Knaul of lying and joking about the state of the Maldivian judiciary system. Knaul's statements highlighted that the JSC – mandated with the appointment, transfer and removal of judges – was unable to perform its constitutional duty adequately in its current form. Her comment was among a number of preliminary observations on the Maldives’ judiciary and wider legal system following an eight-day fact-finding mission.

While Qasim Ibrahim was Finance Minister, there were rumors regarding the nature of the European Investment Bank's (EIB) investment in Maldivian tourism. The European Investment Bank had invested €50,000,000 to support the development of tourism after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. According to the ECD in Colombo, there was no co-ordination between the EIB and the ECD during the design stage of the loans. Only after the ECD reported indications of misuse of money to EIB were some consultations held. Overall co-ordination between EIB and ECD is very limited.
