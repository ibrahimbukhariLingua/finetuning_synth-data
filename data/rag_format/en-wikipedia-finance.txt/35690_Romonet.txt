# Romonet



**Romonet** is a UK-based, privately held company, headquartered in London, UK, that provides cloud-based solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ and services to data centers and associated technology. Romonet solves energy, water, capacity and financial challenges in data centers. Theyᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ claim Romonet makes the first software that accurately predicts total cost of ownership (TCO) and properly model energy flow. They began by creating a term called 'data center predictive modeling' (DCPM) that "rather than collecting real-time data, they predict data center configuration and architecture." Romonet Inc was launched in 2011 with the goal of bringing the product to the US market.

In February 2019 it was announced that the CBRE Group would acquire Romonet.


## History

Romonet was founded in 2006 by Zahl Limbuwala and Liam Newcombe—initially to make software to analyze how much data centers cost to operate. Newcombe said, of IT cost, "The business is effectively prevented from managing operating costs or understanding the contribution to profitability." In 2009, they collaborated to release an open source engine with the British Computer Society's Data Centre Specialist Group. Though the simulator was at an early stage, it was able to predict cost and power usage.

On 24 June 2011, Romonet opened two new offices in the United States, their headquarters in San Francisco and an office in the Empire State Building in New York.

## Products


### The Romonet platform

Romonet claims they have the only cloud-based, big data software platform that models, simulates, and predicts data center investment and operational performance. They say their analytics platform enables energy, financial, investment, and profitability objectives.

In November 2010, Romonet introduced Romonet Software Suite as a predictive modeling tool for data center decisions. Romonet claims that it uses mathematical computation and computer aided simulation to perform non-intrusive, risk-free predictive modeling. It does not require that the software directly interact with the data center, and can model data centers in a simulated environment.

A Chief Architect at Intel said 'Romonet Software Suite could be a game-changer as the leading TCO/Predictive modeling solution for the data center industry.‛ and Roy Illsley, principal analyst at Ovum Ltd "Predictive modeling enables companies to analyze and compare scenarios and say whether the move makes sense or not. Such level of knowledge and information is a great basis to make decisions, based on better assessments." The company hopes that Romonet Software Suite will succeed in the growing field for data center infrastructure management (DCIM) tools.

In November 2012, Romonet introduced Romonet Operations Portal a cloud-based solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ that they intend data centre operators to use to forecast, plan, and measure business performance.


### Romonet Operations Portal

Romonet Operations Portal is an online view of data center performance that tracks several metrics and facilitates comparison of expected performance (as modeled) and actual performance as reflected from meter readings through the facility's BMS system.


### Validated by ROMONET

January 2017 saw the launch of Validated by ROMONET, the "first independent certification process to measure the full end-to-end performance of the data center" throughout its lifecycle.


## Environment

Liam Newcombe and Zahl Limbuwala regularly contribute to forums such as The Green Grid, a consortium collaborating to improve the resource efficiency of data centers and business computing ecosystems.
Liam has actively been involved with and contributed to the EU Code of Conduct for Data Centres.
Both Romonet Software Suite and Operations Portal identify the amount of CO₂ a Data Center produces to help organizations plan how to operate with less impact on the environment.
