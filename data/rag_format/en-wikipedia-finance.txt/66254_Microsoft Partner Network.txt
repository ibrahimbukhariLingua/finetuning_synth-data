Microsoft Partner Network


# Microsoft Partner Network



**Microsoft Partner Network** or **MPN**, formerly known as the **Microsoft Partner Program** or **MSPP**, is Microsoft's partner network which is designed to make resources available to a wide variety of technology companies so they can build a business around Microsoft technologies.

The program consists of 400,000 of partners, vendors and service providers that build or sell solutions based on Microsoft products as of March 16, 2022. It is difficult to ascertain the exact count, Microsoft blogs and channel magazines in 2017 and 2021 listed 100,000 partners in the US and 30,000 in the UK, but the worldwide number is probably in the millions.

These partners include systems integrators, original equipment manufacturers, independent software vendors, value-added resellers, telecommunications companies, Internet hosting services, marketing agencies, and resellers.

As of 2009, this business ecosystem generated $8.70 in revenue for partner companies for every $1 that Microsoft makes.
