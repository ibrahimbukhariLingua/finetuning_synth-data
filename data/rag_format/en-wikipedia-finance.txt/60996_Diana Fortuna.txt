In the early 1980s, Fortuna began her career at New York City's Office of Management and Budget, where she eventually became Deputy Budget Director under Mayor Ed Koch.ʷʰᵉⁿ? Beginning in 1990, she served in the New York State Office of Federal Affairs in Washington, D.C., where she analyzed federal policy issues.

In 1998, Fortuna became the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a non-profit watchdog group that monitors the finances and operations of New York City and New York State government. While at the CBC, Fortuna generally advocated controlling New York State spending more and reducing New York State's public debt load. She also supported Mayor Mike Bloomberg's plan to implement congestion pricing in New York City.

*Crain's New York Business* called Fortuna "One of the most well-known advocates for fiscal responsibility in New York". When Fortuna left the CBC, New York City Comptroller William C. Thompson, Jr. stated, "Diana Fortuna has done an outstanding job as President of the Citizens Budget Commission over the past nine years. Under her leadership, the CBC has fulfilled a critical role as a non-partisan watchdog of both New York City and New York State finances. Throughout her tenure, she has been a strong advocate of fiscal reform and has offered constructive advice to City and State government at every level".

In 2005 *New York Common Cause* honored Fortuna with the *Making Peoples' Voices Heard Award* for her work in helping to advance the movement for reform of New York State government. Fortuna sits on the e-Treasury Pennsylvania Advisory Commission.

Fortuna said of joining the Met, "As someone who is interested in the performing arts, it seemed like a great opportunity to enter that field with a perspective I know very well, which is budgeting." Fortuna is now the Met's Chief Financial Officer. She said, "I felt very drawn to what the Met is trying to do, which is to keep classical music alive and well and meaningful".

In 2014, in addition to her CFO position, Fortuna was made deputy general manager.
