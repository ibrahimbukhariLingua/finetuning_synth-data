## Legal issues


### Shareholder lawsuits

In March 2016, the company settled shareholder lawsuits for $219 million. The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and its management made false statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014 as the company had assured investors that the reserves it had set aside to cover long-term care claims were adequate. However the company had to take a $531 million charge to shore up its long-term care business, leading to a substantial drop in the price of Genworth's securities.


### Life insurance premium increases

In October 2022, the company paid $25 million to policyholders to settle a class action lawsuit alleging that premium increases of 40% to 140% were excessive and unlawful.


### MOVEit hack

On 6 June, 2023, third-party vendor to Genworth, PBI Research Services, reported a vulnerability with their MOVEit Transfer software. The vulnerability resulted in a Russian-linked extortion group, named 'C|0p', gaining unlawful access to private data. Whilst PBI Research Services did report the vunlnerability, the company was criticised for not revealing the scope of the hack sooner. The software is used to track deaths of its member organisations so that payments can be issued to the relevant beneficiaries. Whilst a number of state and federal organisations were affected by the hack, between 2.5-2.7 million customers of Genworth Financial had their private data downloaded; including first and last name, date of birth and social security number. On the 22 June, 2023, Genworth filed a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the data breach.
