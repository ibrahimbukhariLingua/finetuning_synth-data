# Wismilak



**PT Wismilak Inti Makmur Tbk**, commonly known as **Wismilak**, is an Indonesian holding company of cigarette producer PT Gelora Djaja and cigarette distributor PT Gawih Jaya, and the fourth-largest Indonesian tobacco manufacturer after Gudang Garam.

With tobacco being addictive and the single greatest cause of preventable death globally, the company has had to contend with rising taxes, health warnings and tougher labeling regulations.


## History

Wismilak's origin has started by Gelora Djaja when it was established in Surabaya, East Java, on September 12, 1962, by Lie Koen Lie and Oei Bian Koen Hok with just 10 employees. The company has been listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange since 18 December 2012 under the symbol "WIIM".

In 2022, Wismilak's net profit increased by 30.33 percent again, to IDR82.16 billion. In fact, in the same period in 2021, WIIM's net profit was only IDR 63.04 billion. The growth of Wismilak's net profit occurred in the midst of the collapse of the net profits of the country's largest cigarette issuers.


## Health warnings and sales

Following the introduction of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets in Indonesia in 2014, several tobacco companies recorded declines in sales. Wismilak corporate secretary Surjanto Yasaputera had initially expressed hope the company would remain on target to increase sales by 20% to 25% in 2014. Wismilak's sales reportedly fell 15.7%, or Rp.760.7 billion (US$57 million), year-on-year from January to July 2017.
