Monneron family


# Monneron family



The **Monneron family** was a French family of businessmen and politicians, best known for the Monneron brothers.

It originated in the small village of Ampurany near Tournon-sur-Rhône, but has been set up in Chanos since 1550. Antoine Monneron and his wife Barbe Arnault had 20 children, 8 of whom died in infancy. They lived successively in Antibes, Tournon (1737), and Annonay (1739) where Antoine bought the position of receiver of the grenier à sel tax. Antoine was also a lawyer to the Parlement and controller-general of the Fermes du Roi to the Parlement d'Antibes.


## Bank

**Les Frères Monneron** was built up in England by Matthew Boulton, thanks to the steam engine of James Watt, producing 2 and 5 sols coins in great quantities in the Soho factory in Birmingham from the end of 1791.

These pieces of necessity money eased the coinage shortage then current in France and their technical and aesthetic quality was much superior to mediocre base metal issues produced by official sources.

In March 1792, the Monnerons went bankrupt and Pierre fled. His brother Augustin took over the business, but a law of 3 May 1792 forbade the production of money by private concerns. In September a decree forbade the commercialisation of confidence-coins. These necessary coins were in circulation until the end of 1793.
