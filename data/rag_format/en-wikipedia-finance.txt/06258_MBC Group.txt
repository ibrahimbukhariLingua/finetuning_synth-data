# MBC Group



**MBC Group** (Arabic: مجموعة إم بي سي, romanized: *Majmūʿat ʾIm Bī Sī*), formerly known as **Middle East Broadcasting Center** (مركز تلفزيون الشرق الأوسط, *Markaz Tilifizyūn al-Sharq al-ʾAwsaṭ*), is a Saudi media conglomerate based in the Riyadh region. Launched in London in 1991, the company moved its headquarters to Dubai in 2002 and to Riyadh in 2022. It is majority owned by the Saudi government-operated Public Investment Fund.

MBC Group operates over 19 free-to-air satellite TV channels, and a video-on-demand service (Shahid). MBC 1 was the first broadcaster to provide a satellite-based, free-to-air 24-hour television broadcasting network across the Arab world. The Group's current chairman is Sam Barnett. Barnett returned as MBC Group CEO in December 2020 after a one-year departure. MBC's television arm broadcasts via Eutelsat, Arabsat and Nilesat satellites. MBC has more than 2,000 staff.

In recent years MBC has been hit with major rounds of financial cuts, leading to 150 layoffs and major production cuts. These cuts were driven in part due to advertising not covering production costs and the failure to acquire exclusive rights to the Saudi league. As of 2011 MBC reported 165 million viewers.

In 2023, 60% of MBC group was owned by Istedamah Holding Company (a subsidiary of the Saudi government's Ministry of Finance), with the rest belonging to its founder Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim. In 2023, MBC Group announced its initial public offering (IPO). The offering consisted of a primary offering of 33,250,000 new ordinary shares, representing 10% of the company's share capital post-listing. This move marked a significant step in the company's financial strategy and opened up new avenues for investment and growth. By October 2024, the stake owned by Istedamah had dropped to 54%, and this stake was transferred to the Public Investment Fund in November 2024.

## Criticism and controversies

In 2007, MBC began airing its first Turkish soap opera dubbed into another language. Over the next few years these programs became a major success for MBC, with over 85 million viewing the finale of *Gümüş*. In 2018, MBC moved to remove all Turkish programming from their channels, no official reason were given, though it was widely considered to be at the direction of the Saudi government, who had a frosty relationship with the government of Turkey at the time. The Turkish government criticised the decision.

In 2017, a number of owners and board members of MBC were summoned to Riyadh where they were arrested, accused of corruption, and locked in the Ritz-Carlton. These moves came following years of the Saudi Crown Prince attempting to purchase the media company. After 83 days the company's chief owner Waleed al-Ibrahim was released. A "senior MBC executive" was cited by Arabian Business stating that Waleed al-Ibrahim was found innocent of any wrongdoing.

In 2019, MBC Masr came under scrutiny for its use of blackface in comedy programming. Popular Egyptian comedian Shaimaa Seif has done a number of programs on MBC using blackface and stereotypes for humor.

In the days following Yahya Sinwar's death in October 2024, MBC aired a report labeling Sinwar, along with Hamas's Ismail Haniyeh, Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, PMF's Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and Iran's Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, as "faces of terrorism" who had been killed in the first quarter of the 21st century. This report sparked outrage in certain circles. In Baghdad, supporters of Iran-backed armed groups stormed the channel's local offices, filming themselves as they vandalized equipment and destroyed computers. Hours later, Iraqi regulators suspended the license of the Saudi-owned channel and began proceedings to terminate its operating rights in Iraq. Shortly afterwards Algeria also suspended MBC's license to operate in the country, reportedly for "portrayal of the wars in a way that weakens the morale of Palestinian and Lebanese people".


## Use of technology

In 2010, MBC Max provided the ability to watch English movies along with watching English movies (English voices) with or without Arabic subtitles.

In July 2011, MBC launched 7 of its channels in HD which includes MBC 1, MBC 2, MBC 3, MBC 4, MBC Action, MBC Max, and MBC Drama. These HD versions of these channels are encrypted using Conax while SD are FTA.

In 2017, Snapchat expanded its "Discover" feature to provide content from regional providers including MBC.
