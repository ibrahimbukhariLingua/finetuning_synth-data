## Quotes

* “When I worked for President Clinton, a philosophy that we shared is the idea that ‘intelligence is distributed everywhere evenly.’ For me, I add on to that, ‘since the beginning of time.’ Since the beginning of time, intelligence has been distributed around the world evenly, but access and exposure has not. That's the only difference. And when you look at even slaves. Slaves weren't dumb. They just didn't have the access or exposure necessary to bring out their intelligence and utilize it publicly. So, if you think about it that way, it's all about access and exposure, because that turns into opportunity.”
* “We’ll get to those with higher incomes,” he assures, “but we do the reverse of trickle down. We want to do trickle up. New technology and new breakthroughs always start at the top and then ultimately get down into the hood. We want to start things in the hood for a change and let it trickle up. So, we’re literally bridging the gap with a low-cost, affordable high-speed broadband connection for those who are living in low income and affordable housing. And you go from there.” Clayton Banks
