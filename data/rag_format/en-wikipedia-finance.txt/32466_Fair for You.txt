Fair for You


# Fair for You



**Fair for You** is a British, not-for-profit online lending company. It is a Community Interest Company set up to provide finance to families who do not have access to mainstream credit, so that they can purchase goods for their home directly from the manufacturers.

Fair for You is the trading name of Fair for You Enterprise CIC. It is owned by the Fair Credit Charity, a registered charity previously called Fair for You Ltd.


## History

Fair for You was established in 2015 by Angela Clements, who had run the Citysave Credit Union in Birmingham. The business model was developed over two years, based on market research done on family households on less than £25k a year.

Fair for You secured £470,000 in September 2014, obtained its FCA licence in December 2015 and was launched in February 2016 at the House of Commons.

According to the Financial Conduct Authority, around half of the people who have used other rent-to-own companies have experienced some degree of late payment fees, with more than one in 10 thought to end up having their goods repossessed. Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Debt and Personal Finance and Labour MP Yvonne Fovargue said at the launch event: "Fair For You is a real alternative to other rent to own companies."

Founder Angela Clements left Fair for You in 2020, and Simon Dukes was made CEO the following year.
