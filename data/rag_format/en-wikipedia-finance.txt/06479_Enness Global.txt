# Enness Global



**Enness Global** is an international mortgage and protection brokerage that specialise in both regulated and unregulated financial products for high-net-worth (HNW) and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals. Enness Global has faced criticism for its exclusivity, catering only to HNW and UHNW individuals, and for a lack of transparency in its fee structures. Additionally, concerns have been raised about regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions and the company's heavy reliance on media-driven branding.

It offers financial services, primarily aimed at HNW and UHNW individuals, including High-value mortgages: specialising in large transactions, typically between £3 million and £5 million.


## History

Enness Global was founded in London, UK in 2007 by Islay Robinson when Robinson recognised a growing demand for specialised property finance following the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC), particularly for international buyers. It provides advisory services for securing high-value financing through a network of private banks and specialist lenders, with a focus on luxury real estate, asset-backed lending, and cross-border financial structuring.

In 2015, the company decided to open an office in Monaco as part of its efforts to diversify beyond London. Despite initial challenges in obtaining approval to operate in Monaco, the company quickly began attracting clients seeking more complex financing options. From 2017 to 2020, Enness Global won the British Large Mortgage Broker Award at the British Mortgage Awards, for three consecutive years.

In 2021, the company expanded by opening offices in Dubai, Jersey, Zurich, Geneva, and France. The CEO, Islay Robinson, was named in the Spears 500 Top Recommended 2024 for Property Investment, Finance, Management, and Private Office Services.
