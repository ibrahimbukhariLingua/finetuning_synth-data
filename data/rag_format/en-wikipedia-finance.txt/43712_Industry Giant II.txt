Industry Giant II


# Industry Giant II



***Industry Giant II*** (German: *Der Industriegigant II*) is a business simulation game for Windows. It is the sequel to *Industry Giant*. Despite a wide range of aspects *Industry Giant II* is not a complete business simulation game, as many management aspects such as finance, sourcing or HR are hardly present. The 'free game' option allows the player not to worry about turning a profit. The game is primarily considered to be a supply chain simulator, because many aspects of strategic, tactical and operational supply chain management are experienced. Next to this, the structure of the game allows the player to understand how supply chains can be modeled. From that point of view, playing *Industry Giant II* can be beneficial in order to understand how enterprise supply chain software is modeling existing supply chains.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
