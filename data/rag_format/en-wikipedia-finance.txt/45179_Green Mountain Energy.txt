**Green Mountain Energy** is a United States company that sells green electricity products via renewable energy credits.


## History

Green Mountain Energy was founded in Vermont in 1997 by Sam Wyly as an offshoot of Green Mountain Power to take advantage of the deregulation of the Texas electricity market. In September 2000, the company moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas. In January 2002, Green Mountain began serving the Texas market and was the first to offer alternative energy in the state. In August 2009 Green Mountain Energy expanded to New York City, serving those in the Con Edison service territory.

In November 2010 Green Mountain Energy was acquired by NRG Energy for $350 million. At that time Green Mountain Energy operated as a standalone subsidiary of NRG, but now operates as one of NRG's brands.

In May 2009 the company launched a "Renewable Rewards" Buy-Back program, which credits customers with renewable generation facilities in their homes for excess energy their facility sends back to the electric grid.

In April 2011 the company launched a solar leasing program for residential solar panels, and announced "Pollution Free EV", a wind electricity product for electric vehicle owners.

In January 2011 Green Mountain Energy signed a two-year agreement to provide 100% renewable energy to the Empire State Building, the largest commercial green power purchase in New York City at that time. In February 2012, the company partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to power Super Bowl XLVI with 15 million kWh of renewable energy. In June 2012, Green Mountain Energy expanded to Pennsylvania, serving those in the PECO and PPL service territories.
