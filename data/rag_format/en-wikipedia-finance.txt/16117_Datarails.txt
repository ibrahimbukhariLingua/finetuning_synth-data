# Datarails



**Datarails** (Hebrew: דאטה ריילס) is an Israeli-based multinational software development company. It is a financial planning and analysis (FP&A) plug-in for Microsoft Excel users.


## History

Datarails was founded in 2015 by Didi Gurfinkel (CEO), Eyal Cohen (COO) and Oded Har-Tal (CTO). It is based in Tel Aviv.

In June 2021, the company had raised US$55 million in Series A funding from investors Zeev Ventures, Vertex Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, and Vintage Investment Partners. It completed its Series B in March 2022 and raised another $50 million from Qumra Capital, La Maison Partners, and Claltech.

In December 2022 the Datarails laid off 18% of its team.


## Product and services

The software is one of many FP&A solutions. It automates data consolidation and financial reporting and provides workflows, templates, and data visualization that facilitate budgeting, forecasting, scenario modeling and financial analysis.


## Controversy

The company has been accused of numerous unethical marketing tactics. In August of 2024 BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division recommended that Datarails, Inc. clearly and conspicuously disclose its material connection to The Finance Weekly website where endorsement, rankings, and reviews appear.

As of January 2025, the company has still failed to disclose their connection to The Finance Weekly and has started a similar website called Best CFO Tools.
