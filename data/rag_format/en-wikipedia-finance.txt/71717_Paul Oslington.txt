## Overview

Paul Oslington is an international expert in the new interdisciplinary field of economics and religion. He has published a series of papers and books exploring the economic dimensions of theological ideas and church practice.

His work explores the way Christian theology has shaped the development of economics as a discipline in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially focusing on the role of natural theology. He argues that following from the Christian doctrines of creation and providence, we can learn what we can about God's character and activity through study of the natural world, including the study of human beings and their economic interactions. Our understanding of the relationship between economics and theology affects Christian ethics, especially the evaluation of markets and questions in business ethics.

Oslington has particularly considered the relationship between economics and theology in the writings of Adam Smith, but has also considered John Henry Newman, Max Weber, Jacob Viner and Bernard Lonergan as exemplars of fruitful ways of relating the disciplines.

He is also published in the areas of history and philosophy of economics, international trade theory, labour economics, and higher education policy.
