Stockport Pyramid


# Stockport Pyramid



The **Stockport Pyramid**, otherwise known as the **Co-operative Bank Pyramid** or simply **The Pyramid**, is a commercial office building in Stockport, Greater Manchester, England.


## History

The Pyramid was intended to be the "signature building" within a larger development scheme that originally included multiple pyramid-shaped buildings. Sources vary on the number of pyramids that were originally planned; some state two further pyramids would be built, whilst others state four more pyramids were planned.

Construction was completed in 1992. During construction, the developers went into administration and the building was repossessed by The Co-operative Banking Group, who had financed the development. Between the completion of the building in 1992 and the occupancy by the Co-operative in 1995, the building was empty. The building was occupied by The Co-operative Bank from 1995 until they relocated to One Angel Square in NOMA in Manchester city centre in 2018.

Several failed development projects near the site, including the pyramid's own unoccupancy immediately after construction and The Co-operative Bank's near-collapse in 2013, led to a superstitious consideration that the site was 'cursed'. The curse was announced as 'lifted' when nearby developments resumed in 2005 with the sale of office blocks in the surrounding business park.

The surrounding business park has been referred to as "The Stopfordian Valley of the Kings", "Kings Reach", or "Kings Valley".

In 2019, the building was bought by the Saudi Arabian investment company Eamar Developments after being advertised for sale in the summer of 2018 for around £4.5 million. The buyer planned to let the site as office space after refurbishment.

In July 2023, plans by restaurant business Royal Nawaab were announced to convert the entire building into a restaurant and banqueting hall. In September 2023, it was confirmed by Royal Nawaab that the conversion will go ahead and the restaurant is due to open in the summer of 2024.


## Design

The pyramid has been described as "avant-garde", "aspirational" and an "incongruous structure" compared to the industrial era buildings commonly found in Stockport. Contrary to it commonly being referred to as a pyramid, the *Manchester Evening News* claims that the building's shape is "more accurately described as a ziggurat".
