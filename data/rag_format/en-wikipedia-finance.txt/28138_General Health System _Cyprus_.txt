General Health System (Cyprus)


# General Health System (Cyprus)



**GeSY** (Greek: Γενικό Σύστημα Υγείας (ΓεΣΥ), *Genikó Sýstima Ygeías*, English: General Healthcare System, GHS) is the universal health insurance system of Cyprus established in 2017 when three government bills and regulations were agreed by parliament after prolonged negotiation led by health minister Yiorgos Pamboridis.

In November 2022 the Cyprus Association of Research and Development Pharmaceutical Companies organised a conference entitled *A New Era for Health Care in Cyprus: Embrace, Evaluate, Evolve* to review the steps and achievements in the three years since the introduction of GESY.

The running of these service is in the hands of the Health Insurance Organisation.
