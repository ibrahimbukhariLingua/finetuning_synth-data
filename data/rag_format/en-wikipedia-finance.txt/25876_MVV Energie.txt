## History and shareholder structure

In 1974, the state-owned Mannheimer Stadtwerke was outsourced in Mannheimer Versorgungs- und Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH (MVV), today MVV GmbH. The individual branches of the industry were divided into various subsidiaries, one of which was Stadtwerke Mannheim AG (SMA). In 1998, SMA was renamed as MVV Energie.

In March 1999, the company became the first municipal company partially privatized through an IPO, with a free float of just 4.8 percent of its equity. The City of Mannheim is the majority shareholder since then. In October 2007, the RheinEnergie in Cologne acquired a share of 16.1% from the city Mannheim. As a result, the shareholder structure looked as follows in February 2015:

50.1% city Mannheim (indirectly via MVV GmbH)
16.3% RheinEnergie
22.5% EnBW
6.3% GDF Suez
4.8% Free Float

In 2017, EnBW bought a 6.28 percent stake in MVV Energie from French energy group Engie, increasing its holding to 28.76 percent. In 2019, both EnBW and RheinEnergie decided to sell their holdings of 45.1 percent in MVV Energie; Australian infrastructure investor First State Investments eventually bought it for 753 million euros ($816 million) in 2020.

From 1999 to 2013, the company belonged to the SDAX.
