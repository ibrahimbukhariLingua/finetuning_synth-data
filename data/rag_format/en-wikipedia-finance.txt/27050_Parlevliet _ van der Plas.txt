# Parlevliet & van der Plas



**Parlevliet & van der Plas** is a privately owned international fisheries company based in the Netherlands, founded in 1949 by Dirk Parlevliet and brothers Dirk and Jan van der Plas.

The company began by purchasing herring at auctions for resale, eventually expanding into operating a large fleet of fishing trawlers operating globally. They are exporters of seafood to Africa and suppliers of fish for zoos.

Parlevliet & van der Plas is certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.

The company operates a 6500 m² freezing store on Faroe Islands, Denmark.

In 2018 P & V bought the German company Deutsche See [de].


## Spread of operations

The firm regularly enters into other fisheries through acquisitions.

Regular acquisitions with partners make the spread of the company extensive, across different fisheries in the world.


## Criticisms

In 2013, Greenpeace lodged a legal complaint against Parlevliet & van der Plas for the alleged dumping of 1.5 million kg of fish into the ocean. Allegations of Greenpeace have been withdrawn after the key witness turned out to have given a false statementᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.

In 2012 and 2015 the firm introduced Super trawlers into Australian waters, utilising the Tasmanian firm Seafish Tasmania. The presence of the trawlers in Australian waters provoked widespread criticism of Seafish Tasmania, and Parlevliet & van der Plas.
