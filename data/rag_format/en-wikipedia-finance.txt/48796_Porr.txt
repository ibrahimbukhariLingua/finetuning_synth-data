# Porr



**Porr AG** (referred to by the company as **PORR AG**) is a construction group listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange with its headquarters in Vienna. It is one of the largest Austrian construction companies and is active nationally and internationally in all sectors of the construction industry: from civil engineering including traffic route construction, tunnelling and special civil engineering, to building construction, environmental engineering and facility management.

Today's parent company, PORR AG, was founded in 1869 under the name Allgemeine Österreichische Baugesellschaft as a public limited company, making PORR the oldest listed company in Austria. The name PORR goes back to the construction engineer Arthur PORR, co-founder of A. PORR Betonbauunternehmung Ges.m.b.H., which merged with the company in 1927.


## History

In 1869, Allgemeine Österreichische Baugesellschaft was founded in Vienna. Its first listing on the Vienna stock exchange was on 8 April 1869. In the 19th century, a number of Vienna Ring Road buildings were erected, such as *Haus der Industrie* on Schwarzenbergplatz. In 1873, the company built seven exhibition pavilions and numerous hotels for the World Exposition in Vienna.

The merger of the two parent companies to form Allgemeine Baugesellschaft - A. PORR Aktiengesellschaft took place in 1927. In 1930 the company did pioneering work with the construction of the world-famous Grossglockner High Alpine Road. In the period between the wars, PORR was involved in the construction of numerous power plants, road, railway and industrial Buildings.

After the war, the construction of prestigious office and commercial buildings followed, such as the striking Ringturm in Vienna in 1953. PORR also increasingly became a general contractor for large national projects. In the seventies, PORR developed the New Austrian Tunnelling Method, which revolutionised civil engineering worldwide. With the establishment of branches outside Austria, the company positioned itself as an international group that realized construction projects of all types and sizes in Europe and the Middle East. In 1973, the Vienna International Center and UNO City were built, hosting the United Nations offices. In the 1980s the group expanded its activities to Central and Eastern Europe. In 2000, PORR became the majority owner of *Teerag-Asdag*, the most important road construction company in Austria at the time.

Since September 2010, Karl-Heinz Strauss has been Chairman of PORR. The PORR Group has been comprehensively restructured under his tenure. At the end of 2010, PORR took over the Teerag-Asdag shares from *Wiener Stadtwerke* and thus became the sole owner. In June 2011, the powerful PORR Bau GmbH was founded; it was created by merging PORR Projekt und Hochbau Aktiengesellschaft with PORR Technobau und Umwelt Aktiengesellschaft.

Since 2012, a syndicate made up of the IGO Industries Group and the Strauss Group has held the majority of shares. The rest are in international free float. In 2013, the company name was changed from Allgemeine Baugesellschaft - A. PORR AG to PORR AG, so that the Group now operates internationally as PORR.

In 2014 the real estate division was spun off and PORR became a pure construction company. In 2016 Teerag-Asdag merged with PORR Bau.

In March 2017, PORR announced the purchase of the Oevermann Group, which belongs to Heijmans.

PORR was listed on the Austrian Traded Index (ATX) for the first time in June 2018.
