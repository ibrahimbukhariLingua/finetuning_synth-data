## History

The liberalization of the Indian economy and the subsequent passing of the IRDA Bill in 1999, expanded the investment opportunities in the insurance industry, bringing in a large number of players. This massive competition has resulted in the insurance sector achieving the highest rate of growth since pre liberalization. The next decade is expected to witness a phenomenal growth in the career opportunities for the insurance professionals.

The course content has been designed with the needs and requirement of the insurance sector in mind, and includes subjects ranging from Actuarial sciences to the concepts of reinsurance and management. The general insurance sector has opportunities for engineers, as their profile caters to the needs of the industry especially in the field of risk inspection and risk management.

The IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India has certified the MBA Insurance as one of the qualifications required for Qualifications of Corporate Insurance Executives and Faculty of Agents’ Training Institutes.

Additionally, the Insurance Institute of India has allowed exemption to the MBA Insurance Degree holders from CISR, to directly appear for the Fellowship Examinations of Insurance Institute of India, exempting it from the Licentiate and Associate programs.
