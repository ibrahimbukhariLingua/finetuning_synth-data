# Kopitiam (company)



**Kopitiam Investment Pte Ltd**, more commonly known as **Kopitiam**, is a Singaporean food court chain focused on local cuisine. Under the FairPrice group along with NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Foodfare and Link, the group serves more than 2 million customers with over 100 million meals annually through its 100+ outlets located islandwide.

## Etymology

The name derives from the generic portmanteau term "kopi tiam". *Kopi* means coffee in Hokkien, and *tiam* is the Hokkien word for shop.


## History

On 21 September 2018, it was announced that NTUC Enterprise would acquire Kopitiam by the end of 2018. The acquisition was approved by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore on 20 December 2018.

In November 2019, NTUC FairPrice, NTUC Foodfare, Kopitiam, and Link joined forces under the FairPrice Group to collectively serve the people of Singapore under the philosophy of "Everything Food Made Easy." As part of this partnership, Kopitiam and NTUC Foodfare were merged to form a single Food Services business unit. The aim of this unit is to provide nourishing meals through various formats, such as food courts in malls, coffee shops, hawker centers, quick-service cafes, and kiosks.
