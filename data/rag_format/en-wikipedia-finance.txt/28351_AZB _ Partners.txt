## History

Zia Mody, an alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard Law School who had worked with Baker & McKenzie in New York City established her own Litigation practice in Mumbai as the sole proprietor of the Chambers of Zia Mody. She had been friends with Bahram Vakil, a graduate of Columbia University who also practiced for 2 years in the United States before returning to India and working as a partner at Little & Co.. The two chose to partner and established CZB (Chambers of Zia and Bahram). Ajay Bahl started his career as a Chartered Accountant but was persuaded by N.K.P Salve to study law and intern with prominent lawyer Soli Sorabjee (Zia's father), after which Ajay set up his own practice in New Delhi.

AZB & Partners was formed in 2004 when CZB & Partners in Mumbai merged with Ajay Bahl & Company in Delhi. The firm has moved away from the traditional family-style set-up, however, and has a clear partnership track in place, which has led it to be credited for the modernity of its practice. The firm entered into a "best friends agreement" with UK-based Clifford Chance in early 2009, which was terminated by mutual agreement in January 2011.
