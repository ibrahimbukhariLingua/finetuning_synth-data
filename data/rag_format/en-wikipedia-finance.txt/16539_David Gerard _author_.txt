# David Gerard (author)



**David Gerard** (born 1967) is an Australian IT systems administrator, finance author and Wikipedia administrator, best known as a cryptocurrency sceptic and commentator on cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and related blockchain technologies. He is the author of the cryptocurrency books *Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain* (2017), and *Libra Shrugged* (2020).


## Criticism of cryptocurrency


### Advocacy

Gerard was labelled as "the most intellectually dishonest man in the crypto universe" by Mike Dudas, editor of *The Block*.


### Books

In 2017, Gerard released his first book, *Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain*, which criticises cryptocurrency for, among other reasons, its energy cost and the high number of exchange hacks. Gerard details technological issues with the infrastructure of blockchain applications, including smart contracts, which he describes as neither smart nor legal contracts. Parts of the book are dedicated to debunking claims made by cryptocurrency advocates; for example, he provides evidence that bitcoin has not dispensed with the malfeasance present in traditional banks and markets or helped people rise out of poverty.

Sue Halpern described the book in *The New York Review of Books* as "a sober riposte to all the upbeat forecasts about cryptocurrency". Martin Walker of the London School of Economics Business Review called the book "the first real, 'no holds barred', attack on the whole bitcoin/cryptocurrency/blockchain movement". Regarding the cryptocurrency bubble, the BBC said, "*Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain* is a very convincing takedown of the whole phenomenon." In the *American Book Review*, Aaron Jaffe recommended it alongside David Golumbia's *Politics of Bitcoin: Software as Right-Wing Extremism*. In 2021 US investor Mike Burry changed his Twitter image to a quote from *Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain*: "NFTs exist so that the crypto grifters can have a new kind of magic bean to sell for actual money, and pretend they're not selling magic beans."

In 2020, Gerard released his second book, *Libra Shrugged*. The book explores Facebook's aborted attempt to create Libra, a cryptocurrency, and discussed reactions to it from central banks.
