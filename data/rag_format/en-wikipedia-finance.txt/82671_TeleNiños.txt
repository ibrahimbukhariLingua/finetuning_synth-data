**TeleNiños** is a Canadian Category B-exempt Spanish language specialty channel owned by TLN Media Group. TeleNiños broadcasts programming primarily aimed at children in addition to select family-oriented programming.


## History

In October 2011, TLN Media Group, at the time a consortium majority owned by Corus Entertainment, was granted approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called *All Spanish Children’s Television*, described as *"a national, niche third-language ethnic specialty Category B service devoted to providing programming to the Spanish-speaking community or to Canadians of Hispanic descent, and who are from preschool age to seventeen years of age."*

The channel launched on November 1, 2011 as **TeleNiños**, exclusively on Vidéotron. On December 4, 2014, TeleNiños launched on Bell Fibe TV. On May 31, 2016, TeleNiños launched on Cogeco. On August 31, 2017, TeleNiños launched on Rogers.

As of February 11, 2019, it and sister channel Telebimbi have operated under exempt status. Shortly after, Corus sold its stake in Telelatino Network to the other co-owners.
