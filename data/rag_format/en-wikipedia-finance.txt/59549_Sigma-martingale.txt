Sigma-martingale


# Sigma-martingale



In mathematics and information theory of probability, a **sigma-martingale** is a semimartingale with an integral representation. Sigma-martingales were introduced by C.S. Chou and M. Emery in 1977 and 1978. In financial mathematics, sigma-martingales appear in the fundamental theorem of asset pricing as an equivalent condition to no free lunch with vanishing risk (a no-arbitrage condition).


## Mathematical definition

An {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}-valued stochastic process {\displaystyle X=(X\_{t})\_{t=0}^{T}} is a *sigma-martingale* if it is a semimartingale and there exists an {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}-valued martingale *M* and an *M*-integrable predictable process {\displaystyle \phi } with values in {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \_{+}} such that
