Deloitte Technology Fast 500


# Deloitte Technology Fast 500



The **Deloitte Technology Fast 500** Awards are organized and overseen by the global professional services firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. These awards recognize the 500 technology companies with the highest growth rates across various regions worldwide. Recipients encompass both publicly traded and privately held companies.

The awards were established in 1997 amid the dotcom boom to showcase the achievements of burgeoning U.S. technology firms. Over time, the Fast 500 initiative has broadened its scope to encompass North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).

The Fast 500 examines companies' relative growth in revenue over a three-year period. A company that grows by $1 million from a revenue of $2 million would be ranked below a company that grows by $500,000 from a revenue of $100,000. The Fast 500 recognizes companies that have shown significant growth, effective strategies, and strong management. It has three main international divisions:

* Fast 500 Asia Pacific
* Fast 500 EMEA
* Fast 500 North America
