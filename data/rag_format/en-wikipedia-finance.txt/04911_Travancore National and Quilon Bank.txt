Travancore National and Quilon Bank


# Travancore National and Quilon Bank



The **Travancore National and Quilon Bank**, often abbreviated as **TN&Q Bank**, was a bank which came to being in 1937 in the princely Kingdom Of Travancore as a result of merger of two well known banks of the time, Travancore National Bank and Quilon Bank.


## History


### Founding

The Travancore National and Quilon Bank was the result of a 1937 merger between Travancore National Bank (founded: 1912) and Quilon Bank (founded: 1919). The merger resulted in TNQB becoming the 4th largest bank in India.


### Management

The bank was owned and managed by two prominent Christian families of Kerala, Chalakuzhy family and Kandathil family with origin from Thiruvalla. Another bank to originate from Thiruvalla was Federal Bank which is headquartered in Aluva now.

The bank had also managed to become the fourth largest bank in India, after the Imperial Bank of India, the Central Bank of India and the Bank of India.


## Final Years

The Travancore National and Quilon Bank was a successful bank in all aspects. But its unrelenting support to Indian National Congress (INC) in the struggle for independence resulted in its downfall. The Dewan(Prime Minister)of Travancore,Sir C.P Ramaswamy Iyer got irked because the banks founders were supporting Indian National Congress instead of the Ruler Of the Kingdom Of Travancore. So, he devised an unethical and dubious plan to close down the bank. His plan was successful and the two founders of the bank, K. C. Mammen Mappillai and Chalakuzhy Paulose Mathen were both falsely implicated and imprisoned by the Dewan, C.P Ramaswamy Iyer and his accomplices.

Aftermath

The bank was closed down after being accused of financial irregularities. But because this was not the truth, the founders were able to repay its investors before closing down permanently in 1939. The banks founders were released from imprisonment without any charges against them being proven.
