## History

The firm was plaintiff in 1994 court case PPM America, Inc. v. Marriott Corp., 4th Circuit. This was due to events beginning in 1992 by Marriott Corp. to split into two entities, giving all $2.4 billion of its debt to one of them, the less profitable, to be burdened with interest costs at 2/3 its cash flows. This was unanticipated, and caused immediate drop in market value of the debt by 30 percent. In 1993, a revised restructuring plan was announced that moved $450 million debt to the other entity, which was accepted by all creditors but PPM America, Inc., which held $120 million of debt issued in April, 1992. Marriott sued for securities fraud.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
