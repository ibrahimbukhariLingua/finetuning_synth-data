Tanaka's formula


# Tanaka's formula



In the stochastic calculus, **Tanaka's formula** for the Brownian motion states that

where *B*ₜ is the standard Brownian motion, sgn denotes the sign function

and *L*ₜ is its local time at 0 (the local time spent by *B* at 0 before time *t*) given by the L²-limit

One can also extend the formula to semimartingales.


## Properties

Tanaka's formula is the explicit Doob–Meyer decomposition of the submartingale |*B*ₜ| into the martingale part (the integral on the right-hand side, which is a Brownian motion), and a continuous increasing process (local time). It can also be seen as the analogue of Itō's lemma for the (nonsmooth) absolute value function {\displaystyle f(x)=|x|}, with {\displaystyle f'(x)=\operatorname {sgn}(x)} and {\displaystyle f''(x)=2\delta (x)}; see local time for a formal explanation of the Itō term.


## Outline of proof

The function |*x*| is not C² in *x* at *x* = 0, so we cannot apply Itō's formula directly. But if we approximate it near zero (i.e. in [−*ε*, *ε*]) by parabolas

and use Itō's formula, we can then take the limit as *ε* → 0, leading to Tanaka's formula.
