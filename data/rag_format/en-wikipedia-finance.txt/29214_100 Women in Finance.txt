100 Women in Finance


# 100 Women in Finance



**100 Women in Finance**, formerly **100 Women in Hedge Funds** (100WHF), is a non-profit organization for professionals who work in the alternative investment and broader finance industry. The organization aims to strengthen women's presence in the finance field by supporting women at each career stage to achieve their career goals. Actual membership comprises more than 30,000 professionals in 32 locations. Professional members advocate for a new generation of leadership, where women and men are equally successful and impactful in their roles as investment professionals and executives.


## History

Sarah Dyer, Dana Hall, and Carol Kim were hedge fund managers who initiated an innovative idea of gathering one hundred senior women investment professionals to build professional relationships where they could enhance their communication and share their ideas and experiences in the alternatives industry. The idea bore fruition when they founded 100 Women in Finance in December 2001 and launched its inaugural event 100 Women in Hedge Funds in New York to educate professionals in the industry about this organization's goals. As the organization grew in the ensuring months, three areas were identified where collaboration could be made to impact the industry and beyond: Peer Engagement, Philanthropy, and Education.

The organization has hosted more than 600 education events globally. Its philanthropic mission focuses on three areas: mentoring, women's and family health, and education. The organization has raised over $40 million gross for various charities.

The organization has been a vanguard in working for a world in which women get an equal opportunity in the highly competitive world of Hedge Funds. The organization frequently holds events for its members to gain insight from other accomplished participants in the field, such as the June 2012 event in New York City, “Up Close and Personal with Eileen Murray,” featuring the CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

In 2010, Prince William of Wales became the Patron of 100 Women in Hedge Funds. In late 2012, it was announced that William, by then Duke of Cambridge; his wife Catherine (then Duchess of Cambridge); and his brother Prince Harry would all be Patrons of 100WHF's Philanthropic Initiatives beginning in January 2013.

In December 2012, Ivanka Trump, Executive Vice President for Development and Acquisitions for The Trump Organization, was announced as one of four new board directors, highlighting what Mimi Drake, president of Permit Capital Advisors and global chair of the 100WHF Association Board, referred to as the organization's "deepening of [its] senior practitioner base to include family office leadership, private equity investors, real estate investing and women on corporate boards."

What began as a simple notion grew into a powerful mission that reverberated through the industry. Professionals from various segments of the industry – from hedge funds to alternative investments – became members. Staffed by more than 500 active volunteers in 28 locations, the model of the non-profit was that the organization's activities would be member- and practitioner-driven. To date, it has organized more than 1,000 educational events. Further, through funding initiatives, the non-profit's network of professionals raised more than $55 million gross to support other non-profit organizations whose mission goals were also aligned with 100 Women in Finance. The organization has become the network for connecting women, knowledge, and resources so each woman can find her own path to success.

In this program, the member becomes a mentee and is connected with one of 100WF's global members, an individual who is employed full-time in the finance industry, who then becomes the mentor. The mentor will share her views on diverse careers within the finance industry and advise the mentee on how to grow her professional network. Furthermore, the mentee will also be added to an exclusive list of candidates who would be considered qualified for potential employment in summer and full-time positions within the industry. The mentor will serve as a positive role model to coach the mentees on career skills development and planning and provide them with resources about industry insights, using her own experience and perspectives as a guiding force.
