According to the State Capital Act, the Authority executive office has power and will enjoy the status of a ministerial office, but with additional unique powers vested to the office. The executive office shall hold both executive power (similar to all provincial governors) and legislative power of a provincial regional representative council, hence no election for provincial governor or legislative body shall ever be held in the future new capital. The capital residents will only participate in three elections: presidential, senatorial, and congressional elections, different from other provinces who may participate up to seven elections. These privileges resulted with the future capital of Indonesia in a unique position among other provinces of Indonesia, even from existing special regions of Indonesia.

On 15 May 2023, President Joko Widodo signed into law Government Regulation No. 27/2023, which detailed rights granted to the authority.

## History


### Formation

The idea of moving Indonesia's national capital away from Java had been around for decades. In 2019 during the Widodo Administration, the plan to seriously move the center of power was put forward and announced to the public in a televised speech. During the annual 16 August address in 2019, in the presence of the People's Consultative Assembly, the president then officially inquired the two houses of the legislature for their support in the new capital initiative.

On 18 January 2022, the People's Representative Council (or DPR, the lower house of Indonesian legislature) passed the 2022 State Capital Act (Indonesian: *Undang-Undang tentang Ibu Kota Negara*), with the future capital named **Nusantara**. All factions in the house supported the passing of the bill into law except PKS, who questioned the necessity of moving the national capital in the middle of COVID-19 Pandemic.

The capital will be governed by **Nusantara Capital City Authority**, governed by a Head and a Deputy Head, directly answerable to the President as a cabinet-level official. Meanwhile, the formation of the Authority, the appointment of officials, and the transfer of assets and personnel to Nusantara will happen following the issuance of relevant regulations.


### Early leadership candidates

Four people were reported to have "higher probability" for the candidate:

* Abdullah Azwar Anas: former Regent of Banyuwangi Regency (2010-2015, 2016–2021).
* Basuki Tjahaja Purnama: former President Commissioner of Pertamina (2019–2024), former Governor of Jakarta (2014-2017), former Deputy Governor of Jakarta (2012-2014), and former Regent of East Belitung (2005-2006).
* Bambang Brodjonegoro: former Ministry of Research and Technology (2019-2021), head of the National Research and Innovation Agency (2019-2021), Minister of National Development Planning (2016-2019), and Minister of Finance (2014-2016).
* Tumiyana: current Chief Commissioner of Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railways project.

In addition, on 20 January 2022 President Widodo expressed his intention to set an architect and had experience in regional managing and governing as future CEO of the Authority. Currently, a few of people which met the criteria also added as candidates of the CEO position.

* Ridwan Kamil: architect, former mayor of Bandung, and former governor of West Java.
* Tri Rismaharini: architect and urban planner, former mayor of Surabaya, and current Minister of Social Affairs.
* Danny Pomanto: former architecture lecturer of Hasanuddin University, and current mayor of Makassar.

On 29 January 2022, the ruling party PDI-P, officially endorsed Basuki Tjahaja Purnama as candidate of the future CEO of Nusantara. Despite the official endorsement, the party stated that they would leave the choice up to the President. In addition to the endorsement of Purnama, PDI-P also officially confirmed its cadres as future CEO candidates aside of Purnama, Tri Rismaharini, Abdullah Azwar Anas, and Hendrar 'Hendri' Prihadi (the latter is the current mayor of Semarang).

Due to lack of Kalimantan politicians or officials or political figures as candidate of the post, local representative from South Kalimantan Regional Representative Council voiced concerns, as potentially the post might ignore any representation of local Kalimantan people. In response of the lack of native Kalimantan figures in the candidacies, on 15 February 2022 representatives of East Kalimantan locals, promoted their favored local candidates:

* Aji Muhammad Arifin, Sultan of Kutai Kartanegara, which presently become Kutai Kartanegara Regent; and
* Aji Muhammad Jarnawi, Sultan of Paser Sultanate, which presently become Penajam North Paser Regent.

Both sultans are deemed as local figures respected by East Kalimantan people. Their names were sent to Jakarta to become the candidates of Nusantara CEO and Vice CEO for the President's consideration.

On 22 February 2022, Joko Widodo announced his own favored candidate for the executives. While he did not mentioned the name, his revelation of additional criteria of independent non-partisan expert for the office made the previous candidate names become unlikely. At the same time from Joko Widodo announcement, a new name was leaked to the press from unnamed officials that Bambang Susantono, former Vice Minister of Transportation during Second United Indonesia Cabinet (2009-2014) and the Vice President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development of the Asian Development Bank became the strongest possible candidate for the office holder. Reportedly Bambang Susantono who was the second choice candidate became front runner, after the first, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama turned down the offer from Joko Widodo.

On 9 March 2022 it was announced that Bambang Susantono and Dhony Rahajoe (managing director of the President Office in Sinar Mas Land) will be inaugurated as Head and Deputy Head of the Capital City Authority, and finally inaugurated on 10 March 2022.


### Transition process

On 5 May 2022, Inter-ministerial Transition Team is activated thru State Minister Decree No. 105/2022. The Inter-ministerial Transition Team is tasked to provide support for the acceleration of preparation, development, and relocation of the State Capital. The team also tasked for supervising and garnering active role from the elements of the relevant ministries/institutions involved in the capital relocation process.


### Activation

On 13 October 2022, the Authority formally activated with inauguration of some officers and deputies.


### Resignation

On 3 June 2024, the Head of the Authority Bambang Susantono and his Deputy Dhony Rahajoe resigned. President Joko Widodo then appoint Basuki Hadimuljono as an acting Head and Raja Juli Antoni as its Deputy.

## Criticisms

Indonesian political scientists were alarmed due to the nature and power given to the Authority as institution and vas power is hold by the executives, and criticized the form since the bill under was discussion. Indonesian political scientists fear that with such large power given by the agency and the executives will lead into formation of "local autocracy" within Indonesia democracy.

On 2 February 2022, a group of citizens filed a constitutional review request to the Constitutional Court. They questioned the need and the legality of the Act, which was promulgated in a speedy manner in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the constitutionality of having a capital region directly governed by the central government via the Authority.

National Research and Innovation Agency political researcher Wasisto Raharjo Jati commented, with such power and prestige hold by the Authority, the CEO post is very promising for politicians and there is a chance for the politicians use it as stepping stone for presidency.

Elements within the central government bureaucracy had voiced their reluctance to be transferred to the new capital, with some asked to be transferred to Jakarta local government instead, and thus stay in Jakarta.
