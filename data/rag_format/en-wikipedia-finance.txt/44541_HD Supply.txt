In 2004, Maintenance Warehouse changed its name to HD Supply. In January 2006, Home Depot announced that it was acquiring Hughes Supply in a $3.2 billion deal. Hughes Supply was then integrated into the HD Supply division. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Home Depot, after changing its CEO from Bob Nardelli to Frank Blake, decided to sell HD Supply in order to raise capital to repurchase Home Depot stock and shore up the stock price. In 2007, the HD Supply was purchased by private equity firms Bain Capital, The Carlyle Group, and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, and continued to operate as HD Supply.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
