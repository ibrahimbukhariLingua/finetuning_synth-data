## Career


### Schulze Global Investments

In 2006, Schulze founded Schulze Global Investments (SGI) using family capital. The firm specialized in risky private equity investments in frontier economies, with a particular focus on Ethiopia, North Korea, and other politically contentious, high-risk markets. By 2013, Schulze operated from Singapore, managing investments across sectors such as coffee, cement, education, and hydropower. Schulze joined Cerberus Capital Management after SGI was acquired by Cerberus in November 2018.


### North Korea

In 2008, Schulze independently pursued and provided three loans of hundreds of thousands of dollars to North Korean state-owned enterprises to support the procurement of mining equipment. In 2012, he also provided a million-dollar loan for the purchase of corn for workers at a North Korean business conglomerate. The following year, Schulze also made four loans of a million dollars to entrepreneurial state-owned exporters in North Korea.

In 2012, Schulze gained attention for attempting to introduce Coca-Cola to North Korea without approval from the company. Coca-Cola denied that a representative went to North Korea, saying, "No representative of the Coca-Cola Co. has been in discussions or explored opening up business in North Korea."


### Role in U.S.-North Korea Backchannel During the Trump Administration

In the summer of 2018, Schulze approached the Trump administration with information that a senior North Korean official sought to establish a backchannel for dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump. Prior to this, Schulze had reportedly established connections with members of the Trump family during their exploration of business opportunities in Asia.


### Ethiopia

In 2012, Schulze established the first private equity fund focused on investments in Ethiopia. The Schulze family initially contributed $10 million to the fund. The fund supports businesses in sectors such as coffee, education, and cement, and maintains minority stakes reaching up to 40% in each business.


### Other

In addition to Ethiopia and North Korea, Schulze has made investments in Mongolia and Georgia. In Mongolia, he backed businesses in cashmere production and mining services, while in Georgia, he invested in a $100 million hydropower fund. Schulze met with Georgia's Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili in 2016 to discuss investment opportunities in the Georgian market.
