**Collins Aerospace** is an American technology company that is one of the world's largest suppliers of aerospace and defense products. It was formed in 2018 from the merger of Rockwell Collins and UTC Aerospace Systems. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, it is a subsidiary of RTX Corporation.



## History

On November 26, 2018, United Technologies announced the completion of its Rockwell Collins acquisition, after which it merged its newly acquired business with UTC Aerospace Systems to form Collins Aerospace. This acquisition controversially led to multiple class action lawsuits being filed against the company alleging that the executives deliberately misled its shareholders on the nature of the acquisition.

The new company reported $26 billion of combined sales in 2019 and is composed of 68,000 employees. In 2020 United Technologies merged with Raytheon Company to form Raytheon Technologies.

In July 2023, Collins agreed to sell its actuation and flight controls business unit to French multinational Safran in an all-cash deal worth $1.8 billion.

On 24 January 2024, Collins Aerospace, announced an investment of over £16 million at its Kilkeel site in Co Down for developing advanced passenger seating for wide-body and twin-aisle aircraft. This investment was announced by Joe Kennedy III, US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs.

In October 2024, Collins Aerospace, a business division of RTX (Raytheon Technologies), announced the first deliveries of its upgraded Venue cabin management system. This latest iteration of the Venue system incorporates advanced smart monitors and an enhanced graphical user interface, designed to improve in-flight entertainment and usability for both operators and passengers. The upgraded system emphasizes simplicity, allowing for a more intuitive user experience. Venue systems are commonly used in various aircraft to manage lighting, entertainment, and environmental settings within the cabin.
