Dixie-Narco


# Dixie-Narco



**Dixie-Narco** was a former brand of soda vending machines located in Williston, South Carolina owned by Crane Merchandising Systems.


## History and description

Founded in Ranson, West Virginia, the company's production facilities were relocated to Williston in 1989. Formerly a subsidiary of Maytag, it is now a subsidiary of Crane Co., who also owns the Crane National, Glasco Polyvend Lektrovend (GPL), and Automatic Products (APi) brands.

The company was an early adopter of employee-suggestion-driven cost savings, soliciting suggestions based on the Rucker "share of production" plan in the early 1960s that helped drive down manufacturing costs.

In 2017, the Dixie-Narco, along with the National, GPL, and Automatic Products brands were retired in favor of the single Crane Merchandising Systems brand. The former Dixie-Narco glass front products are still produced today under the CMS brand.


## Legal dispute with Donald Trump

In 1991, Dixie-Narco was involved in a legal dispute with Donald Trump before a Federal Bankruptcy Court related to Trump's Taj Mahal Casino. Dixie-Narco claimed that they were owed payment by Trump for 1,350 bill-changing machines they had supplied the casino with, and that the bond-holder approval necessary for Trump's Chapter 11 filing had been improperly solicited as Trump had told them that Dixie-Narco's claim for $6 million of the machines was "worthless". Trump also asserted that the machines had often broken down. The claim was settled with an offer of $2.4 million to be paid in increasing installments to Dixie-Narco, as well as the Taj Mahal returning 500 of the machines, in return for which Dixie-Narco withdrew their objection to Trump's Chapter 11 debt restructuring.
