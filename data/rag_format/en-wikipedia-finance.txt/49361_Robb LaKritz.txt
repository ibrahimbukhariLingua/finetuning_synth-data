LaKritz began his career with the Washington, D.C. law firm of Baker Donelson, working in the firm's International practice, which included former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and former White House Chief of Staff and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker.

In 2001, LaKritz was appointed by U.S. President George W. Bush as Advisor to the Deputy Secretary of the United States Treasury, a senior U.S. economic policymaking role.

He was involved in the formation of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a fund established by the U.S. government to reduce poverty through economic growth in some of the world's poorest countries; U.S. efforts to stem the financing of terrorism; and U.S. efforts to promote financial stability abroad. In March 2009, he was named by the *Wall Street Journal* to its *Future of Finance Initiative*, along with other senior-ranking economic officials from five prior United States Presidential administrations.


## Business

In 2004, LaKritz and fellow U.S. Treasury alumnus Joshua Adler founded LaKritz Adler Development, LLC, a real estate development company focused on revitalizing areas of the U.S. capital. After purchasing its first property at 1525 9th Street NW, the historic home of Watha T. Daniel, the company grew rapidly during the first decade of the twenty-first century. Its projects included the redevelopment of Dupont Circle's historic Starbucks Building, which houses the first Starbucks opened in the eastern United States. LaKritz Adler acquired the landmark building in 2010 for $4 million, redeveloped and expanded it, and later sold it for $16.25 million in a private auction that was reported to have set the all-time record for highest price per square foot ever paid for a retail building in Washington, D.C. Lakritz Adler's other projects in the Dupont Circle and Georgetown neighborhoods included the Veritas Building, another historical redevelopment, and 5185 MacArthur, the largest mixed-use building in Georgetown's tony Foxhall area.

Throughout the 2000s, LaKritz Adler also played a prominent role in the development of Washington, D.C.'s high-end luxury condominium market: Its Moderno project was the fastest selling condominium project in Washington, D.C., in 2009. It also was an early champion of the redevelopment of Georgia Avenue, Washington, D.C.'s longest commercial boulevard. LaKritz Adler opened Temperance Hall, Georgia Avenue's first sit-down restaurant in more than fifty years, and it later developed Petworth Station, which brought a full-service pharmacy back to the Petworth section of Washington, D.C. for the first time in decades. The firm's projects have been profiled in the *Washington Post*, *Washington Times*, *Washington Business Journal*, *Washington City Paper*, *DC Spaces Magazine*, *DC Modern Luxury*, *OnSite Magazine*, and on Fox5 News.

LaKritz was named one of the most influential people under 40 in the nation's capitol by *Washington Life Magazine*. He has been a director on the board of the Washington, D.C. Chapter of the Entrepreneurs Organization, as well as a member of the 2008 Class of Leadership Greater Washington, District of Columbia Bar Association, Urban Land Institute, D.C. Preservation League and D.C. Building Industry Association. He also has been an annual participant in the Aspen Institute Ideas Festival and TED since 2004.
