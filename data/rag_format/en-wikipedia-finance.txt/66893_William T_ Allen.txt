## Career


### Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery

Allen was the Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery from 1985 to 1997. In the Lacos Land Co v Arden Group, Inc case, Allen found that "As a director and officer Briskin has a duty to act with complete loyalty to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. His position in demanding the amendments under threat of thwarting corporate transactions is inconsistent with that obligation. The stockholder vote was fatally flawed by the threats. Shareholders were inappropriately placed in a position in which they were told that if they refused to vote affirmatively Briskin would not support future transactions that might be beneficial to the corporation. A vote of the shareholders under such circumstances cannot satisfy the mandate of Section 242(b) requiring shareholder consent to charter amendments."

As Chancellor Allen observed that: "The judges of that court spend most of their time adjudicating cases of alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by corporate officer or directors."²


#### Independence Standards Board (ISB)

Allen was responsible for the establishment of the Independence Standards Board (ISB) in July 1997, which was "created in response to the increasing challenges of addressing auditor independence issues as business and professional relationships [became] more complex," the ISB [was to] operate within the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and will be under the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
