Periodic deposit


# Periodic deposit



A **periodic deposit** is an investment made in the form of equal deposits over a regular time period. Each deposit recurs after a time interval. Such an investment is made to achieve a pre-planned financial objective and/or when the available capital to invest is limited.

In simpler words, periodic deposit is a deposit recurring on a periodic basis. Investments are made over the period, grow over the period and mature at the end of the period.
