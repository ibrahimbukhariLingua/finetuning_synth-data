Between 1983 and 1990 IBI was owned by then chief editor and publishing director Nick Hopkinson, who has worked at IBI since its launch. Hopkinson sold the magazine to United Newspapers before buying it back as part of a greater investment consortium in 1995. They sold it to Time Inc. in 1998. In 2017 Time Inc. was acquired by Meredith Corp. Hopkinson then purchased IBI for the third time with his management team, when Time Inc. decided to close the magazine.
