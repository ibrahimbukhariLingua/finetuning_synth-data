BRW (magazine)


# BRW (magazine)



***BRW*** (formerly ***Business Review Weekly***) was an Australian business magazine published by the Fairfax Media group. The magazine was headquartered in Melbourne. It regularly compiled lists which rank corporations and individuals according to various criteria, similar to *Fortune* magazine in the United States. *BRW* provided news and commentary on the economy, business and investment in Australia. The magazine reported on successful business strategies, investments and entrepreneurialism. Cover stories and features concentrated on ways to make money and improve businesses. Each week *BRW* focused on a sector or topic relevant to business people or investors.


## Print edition axed

In October 2013, Fairfax announced that the print version of the magazine would be discontinued, with the 28 November 2013 magazine being the last edition.


## Online edition

From December 2013, *BRW* became an online-only publication and the paywall previously in place was removed. Some popular annual lists will also be published in Fairfax's *The Australian Financial Review*. On 4 March 2016, Fairfax announced the closure of the BRW website, with staff and the BRW website to be redirected to a new section of *The Australian Financial Review*. Rich lists, which would also be published by *The AFR* would continue to carry the BRW branding.
