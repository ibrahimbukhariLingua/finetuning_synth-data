# ETF Ride Systems



**ETF Ride Systems** is a Dutch manufacturer of amusement ride systems. It was founded in 1999 and is owned by the ETF Group. The company has manufactured both tracked and trackless systems for both dark and outdoor rides.


## History

ETF Ride Systems was founded in 1999 as a subsidiary of the ETF Group. The ETF Group currently encompasses ETF Machinefabriek, Sioux Electronics, ETF USA Corporation, and ETF Ride Systems.

One of the company's first projects was to create a dark ride system for Sally Corporation's Labyrinth of the Minotaur ride. It opened in 2000 at the Terra Mítica amusement park in Spain. The ride system consists of several vehicles featuring laser blasters moving along a trackless system. Although this tracked dark ride system was used on other rides, the company has also developed a trackless dark ride system to expand on their offerings.

In 2010, ETF Ride Systems began designing a new ride system for Europa-Park in Germany. Following nine months of design and construction, Da Vinci Flight opened in August 2011. The ride system consists of several vehicles suspended from an overhead monorail line with guests controlling the speed of the ride through the use of on-board pedals.

Effective July 1, 2024, founder and CEO Ruud Koppens announced his retirement. With no a successor appointed, the company was instead sold off to Liechtenstein's Spieldiener family, owner of Intamin; ETF Ride Systems will however continue to operate independently.
