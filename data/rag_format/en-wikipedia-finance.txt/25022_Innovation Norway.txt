## The “Sommarøy” controversy

In the summer of 2019 Innovation Norway were involved in the production of a spoof news story about the island Sommarøy. The story claimed that due to long days in the summer and long nights during winter, inhabitants didn't have the need to follow international conventions of time. The aim of the spoof news story was to advertise Northern Norway. The advert was originally presented as a legitimate news story, and its multiple false claims were only discovered after the story had been disseminated worldwide. The company was strongly criticized for their promotional strategy. Innovation Norway has since issued an apology regretting their lack of transparency and vowing to scrutinize their routines.
