## Controversies

In April 2016, the online furniture store Housefull International sued Mebelkart for selling imitations and defaulting on its payments. Housefull had ceased its association with Mebelkart some months earlier as the marketplace had large outstanding debts, but claimed that fake Housefull products were still being sold through Mebelkart's website.

*DNA India* reported in June 2016 that several different vendors claimed that Mebelkart had been withholding payments, and as a result the vendors had stopped selling their products through the marketplace.
