For more than three decades, Thomas served as a consultant to Fortune 500 companies, corporations, professional firms, government entities, non-profit organizations and academic institutions. He is the author of seven books on managing diversity. As the founder and first president of the American Institute for Managing Diversity Thomas was referred to as the “father of diversity” and recognized as a pioneer in the global diversity industry.



Rufus Roosevelt Thomas, Jr. was born on May 24, 1944 in Chattanooga, Tennessee to Icye (born Potts) and Rufus R. Thomas, Sr. (1917 - 1999). He grew up in Chattanooga with his brother, Robert Potts Thomas, attending Chattanooga Public Schools and graduating from Howard High School in 1962.

Thomas went on to attend Morehouse College, where he pledged the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity and received his B.A. summa cum laude in Mathematics in 1966. He earned his M.B.A. in finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Following graduation he returned to Morehouse to teach economics, finance and accounting.

In 1970, Thomas enrolled at Harvard Business School. The following year, he married Ruby L. Jones, a Wellesley College graduate.

In 1984, Thomas founded the American Institute for Managing Diversity, a nonprofit diversity think tank located on Morehouse’s campus. He is credited with broadening the topic of managing diversity in organizations to move beyond affirmative action and include all employees.
