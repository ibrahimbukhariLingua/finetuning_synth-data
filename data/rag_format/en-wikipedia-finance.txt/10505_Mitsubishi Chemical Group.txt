## History

On December 4, 2021, the company announced they would be leaving the commodity chemical businesses by the 2023 fiscal year. The petrochemical and coal-chemical units accounted for $4.8 billion a year in sales and they said the reason for divesting is Japan's shift toward carbon neutrality and poor growth potential.
