It adds that the RBI had instructed that while acknowledging the Caution Advice, they should report the occurrence of such incidents at their banks. If no such incident was observed, a NIL statement should be furnished. RBI revealed that PNB, had not responded to the said caution advice until February 2018, when the fraud came to light.
