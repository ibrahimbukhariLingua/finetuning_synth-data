## History

ClearSlide was founded in October 2009, funded by the founders and through initial subscribers. The company did not raise funds until the year following its launch. In August 2012, ClearSlide raised a $28 million series B round of financing, announcing that it was to fuel their rapid growth and expansion plans. On March 5, 2013, the company bought SlideRocket from VMware. A second acquisition was announced on July 2, 2013, when ClearSlide bought Crunched, a rival cloud-based sales engagement platform. In February 2014, ClearSlide raised $50 million in Series C funding from their partnership with Social+Capital Partnership. This led to additional contributions from Greylock Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners and Felicis Ventures.

The company's products include Microsoft Dynamics Integration, Gong Integration, My ClearSlide, Slack Integration, and Salesforce Integration.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
