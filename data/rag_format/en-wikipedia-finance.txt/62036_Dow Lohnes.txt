# Dow Lohnes



**Dow Lohnes** PLLC was an AmLaw 200 American law firm headquartered in Washington, D.C., founded as Dow, Lohnes & Albertson in 1918.

In 1928, Fayette B. Dow encouraged his partner Horace Lohnes to investigate the regulation of radio transmitters under the newly-established Federal Radio Commission, and the potential to develop a clientele engaged in broadcasting.

Fred W. Albertson represented FM radio pioneer Edwin Armstrong, as well as Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. He and Lohnes built the firm's practice of representing companies with interests in both television and radio.

By 1990 the firm had 200 lawyers.

Dow Lohnes Sports and Entertainment LLC was established in 2003 as a division within Dow Lohnes PLLC.

In January 2014, Dow Lohnes merged with Cooley LLP.
