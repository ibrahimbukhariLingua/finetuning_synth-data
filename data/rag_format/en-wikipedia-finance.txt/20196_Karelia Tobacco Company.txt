## History


### 1888 to 1991

The company's roots date back to 1888, when the first generation of the Karelia family established itself as a small tobacco business in Kalamata, Greece. Its activities were largely regional in the first few decades of its operations, until the political and economic outlook in the country became more stable allowing Karelia to expand the markets for its brands on a nationwide level. From the 1950s until today, numerous Karelia brands have gained popularity resulting in a wide circulation and substantial market share in all of Greece.
The corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities have been traditionally located in Kalamata, and since 1971 have been situated in the current premises that were built, totaling an area of 80,000 square meters. The sales and marketing offices are located in the Karelia Building in Athens.
The company entered the Athens Stock Exchange in 1976, and was publicly traded under the name Karelia Brothers. That same year, Karelia became the Greek licensed manufacturer for RJ Reynolds (currently Japan Tobacco International), by producing and distributing the brand Winston, and subsequently in 1981, with the Camel brand.
Since the early 1990s the group has been transformed from a predominantly Greek company into an international group.
In 1991 the company adopted its current name, the Karelia Tobacco Company Inc. In 1994 Karelia established an office in Sofia, Bulgaria. Karelia's wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Duty Free Specialists, a shipchandling company was acquired in 1995 and Karelia Belgium was established. Karelia Investment was established in 1997.


### 2000 to present

In the year 2000, Karelia ended its cooperation with Japan Tobacco International, in order to concentrate on developing its own trademark brands.
In 2003, the company established a subsidiary in the UK called Karelia Tobacco Company (UK) Ltd. for the distribution of its brands in that market. In 2007, the subsidiary in Bulgaria was upgraded to a commercial import company called Karelia Bulgaria EOOD, and then its subsidiary GK Distributors EOOD was established. In 2008, a subsidiary was established in Turkey, called Karelia Tütün ve Tiçaret A.S. In that same year, Karelia acquired the Backwoods cigar brand from Altadis S.A., for the Greek domestic and duty free markets.
Today, Karelia Tobacco Company is Greece's largest cigarette manufacturer and exporter. It operates offices all over Greece, and distributes its brands to a sales network covering more than 26,000 points of sale.
Its current annual sales turnover is 876 million euros.
