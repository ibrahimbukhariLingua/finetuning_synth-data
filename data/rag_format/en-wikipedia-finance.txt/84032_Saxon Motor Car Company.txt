Saxon Motor Car Company


# Saxon Motor Car Company



The **Saxon Motor Car Company** was located in Detroit, Michigan, from 1914 to 1922. In 1917, 28,000 cars were made, making it the seventh largest car maker in the United States.


## History

Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Motor Car Company began the company to market a low priced volume car. The first **Saxon** was a 2-seat runabout with 2-speed transmission and a four-cylinder engine made by Ferro and built in the old Demotcar factory. 7,000 were made in the first year of production. The cost of a Saxon in 1913 was $395, equivalent to $12,177 in 2023.

From 1913 to 1914, electric lighting was an extra option, which became a standard fitting to the car in 1915. Also available in 1915 was the Saxon Six, a five-passenger tourer, with a 30–35 hp (22–26 kW) Continental six-cylinder, electric starter and headlights, on a 112 in (2845 mm) wheelbase and 32×3½-inch (81×8.9 cm) wheels, all for $785, equivalent to $23,643 in 2023.

In 1914 a Saxon roadster was driven 135 miles a day for 30 days, for a total of 4,050 miles with an average of 30 mpg. It was among the first cars to christen the new Lincoln Highway. Sales skyrocketed. In 1915, Harry W. Ford, formerly with Chalmers, bought out Hugh Chalmers interest and became President of a reorganized **Saxon Motor Car Corporation**. Early in 1915, Saxon moved production to the former Abbott factory.

In its peak year of 1916, 27,800 Saxons were produced. The Saxon Six was followed in 1917 by a Sedan. In December 1917, Harry W. Ford was out and the new president was Benjamin Gotfredson. From 1918 the company got into financial difficulties while expanding, with large quantities of parts and building a larger factory. The 4-cylinder models were dropped from the range and the Sedan went as well in 1919.

In 1919 C. A. Pfeffer, another former Chalmers manager, became president of Saxon Motor Car Corporation. The new factory Saxon couldn't pay for was sold to General Motors. In 1920 a new model, the Saxon Duplex, powered by an overhead-valve, four-cylinder engine joined the six-cylinder model and a sedan body rejoined the range. The six-cylinder cars were no longer listed after 1921 and production had fallen to 2,100 cars.

In 1921, Saxon sold off their parts business to settle debts and used the proceeds to move the company to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where the cars were made in the Ace car plant, but this could not save the company and the last cars, probably made in 1922, were sold in 1923.
