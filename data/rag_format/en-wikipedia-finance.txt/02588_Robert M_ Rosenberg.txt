## Career

In 1963, at the age of 25, Rosenberg assumed leadership of his family business, Universal Food Systems, as CEO and president. At the time, the company consisted of several small businesses grossing $20 million per year, including 100 Dunkin' Donuts locations in the U.S., generating $10 million in annual sales. Rosenberg transformed Universal Food Systems to focus on Dunkin' Donuts.

On February 6, 1968, Rosenberg took the company through its initial public offering. In September 1983, Rosenberg became chairman while continuing to serve as CEO of Dunkin' Donuts. The company remained publicly traded until 1989, earning investors a 35% compound rate of return. During his tenure as Dunkin' Donuts CEO, Rosenberg served on the board of the International Franchise Association. In 1970, he served as the association's chairman.

In late 1989, Dunkin' Donuts announced its acquisition by Allied-Lyons PLC, a large UK food and beverage group which also owned Baskin-Robbins. Rosenberg continued to lead the company that became known as Allied Domecq Retailing (later Dunkin' Brands) which also acquired Togo's sandwich shops. By the time Rosenberg retired in 1998, the company had about 6,500 locations around the world.

Following his retirement, Rosenberg went on to become an adjunct professor at Babson College's F. W. Olin Graduate School of Business. He also served as a trustee of the college. In addition to teaching at Babson, Rosenberg was on the board of directors at Sonic Corp., from April 1993 to 2016, and Domino's Pizza, from 1999 until April 2010, where he served both companies as chairman of their compensation committees.
