**Kion Group AG** (styled as **KION Group**) is a German multinational manufacturer of materials handling equipment, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. Its principal products are intralogistics, warehouse automation equipment, and industrial (forklift) trucks. Kion Group was founded in 2006 by the demerger of Linde's materials handling equipment operations. It is the world's second-largest manufacturer of forklifts measured by revenues (after Toyota Industries).


## Name

"Kion" is an invented name derived from the Swahili word "Kiongozi", which means "leader".


## History


### Foundation and beginnings

On 6 September 2006, Linde AG announced a new structure following the completion of its acquisition of BOC, with the gas and engineering businesses of the combined entity operating as The Linde Group and the materials handling businesses (Linde Material Handling, Still, and OM Carrelli Elevatori S.p.A.) operating as Kion Group from then on. Linde AG sold Kion Group to a partnership of KKR and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for approximately €4 billion.

In January 2009, Kion Group formed a China-based forklift manufacturing joint venture, Kion Baoli (Jiangsu) Forklift, with Jiangsu Shangqi Group and Jingjiang Baoli Forklift. In May 2010, Kion Group acquired full management control of Kion Baoli.

In March 2011, Kion Group and the Indian engineering company Voltas agreed to form a new joint venture, Voltas Materials Handling, consisting of the two companies' material handling equipment operations in India. Kion Group acquired Voltas' 34% shareholding in the venture in November 2012.

In August 2012, the China-based Shandong Heavy Industry's Weichai Power subsidiary agreed to acquire a 25% stake in Kion Group for €467 million, and a 70% majority stake in Kion's hydraulics business for €271 million.

In order to speed up delivery times, production of other product series, which had previously been manufactured exclusively in Xiamen, China, was also relocated to Kołbaskowo one year later.

In December 2021, Kion opened a counterbalance truck plant for the Kion companies Linde Material Handling and Baoli in Jinan, China on an area of around 223,000 square metres, which includes a research and development centre, a training centre and office space.

Fenwick is the largest supplier of industrial trucks in France, OM Still is the market leader in Italy, while OM Voltas serves the Indian market as the leading supplier of industrial trucks.


## Research & development

In August 2020, Kion entered into a strategic partnership with the Chinese manufacturer of autonomous mobile robots, Quicktron Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd, which, in addition to the global distribution of Quicktron products by Kion, provides for the joint development of automated vehicles.

In October 2021, Kion licensed an AI-equipped autonomous vehicle fleet for sorting and distribution, developed by Fraunhofer IML in Dortmund and has collaborated on its further development since.

In December 2023, Kion and Aschaffenburg Technical University presented the results of a research project in which scenarios for the use of autonomous counterbalance trucks equipped with electro-hydraulic steering were developed.

In January 2025, Kion partnered with NVIDIA and Accenture to integrate **"Physical AI"** into warehouse operations. This initiative involves using **NVIDIA Omniverse** to create **digital twins** of warehouses, allowing advanced simulations and real-time optimizations. The collaboration is expected to enhance warehouse automation, efficiency, and flexibility in supply chain operations.


## Sustainability

Since the beginning of 2023, the company has been developing and producing fuel cell systems for the company's own industrial trucks in the field of hydrogen drives. In the same year, Kion began production of a 24-volt fuel cell system for warehouse trucks and the construction of a state-funded hydrogen refuelling station with an electrolyser.

As part of the "Kion 2027 Strategy", Kion committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in July 2023. In line with the principles of the SBTi, the company is pursuing the net zero target of being emission-free by 2050 at the latest.

Kion Group, through its subsidiary Kion Battery Systems in Karlstein am Main, manufactures lithium-ion batteries for its electric industrial trucks (Linde MH, Fenwick, Still, Baoli) and automated warehouse operations. In September 2023, Kion partnered with Li-Cycle Holding Corp. to launch an eco-friendly lithium-ion battery recycling program in Magdeburg, aiming to reclaim up to 95% of the batteries' valuable minerals and materials. According to their own statement, Kion intends to recycle up to 5,000 tonnes of battery materials by 2030.
