In Feb. 2023, Wolfpack published a research report that was critical of the investment banking firm, B. Riley Financial. Wolfpack wrote in the report that B. Riley's "biggest risk is that much of its loan book appears headed for bankruptcy." In Aug. 2024, B. Riley reported suspended its dividend, warned of losses and said it had received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The news sent the company's stock price down 50 percent in one day.

In 2019, David founded Wolfpack Research, a short-selling research firm backed by Carson Block's Muddy Waters Capital. The company's ethos revolves around, as Block puts it, "uncovering financial fraud and other wrongdoing at public companies", in continuation of the public image David built himself in the 2018 documentary film *The China Hustle* and in his congressional run. However, critics point out that David "is still profiting from the losses of these companies, and it remains unclear as to what he is doing with this money."

David is a native of Flint, Michigan but has resided in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, with his wife for more than 20 years. He credits some of his drive to pursue fraud and corporate wrongdoing in the financial markets from having witnessed personal devastation and poverty that resulted from broken corporate promises to the people of Flint.
