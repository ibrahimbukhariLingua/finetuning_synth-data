Health care efficiency measures


# Health care efficiency measures



**Health care efficiency measures** compare delivery system outputs, such as physician visits, RVU's, or health outcomes, with inputs like cost, time, or material. Efficiency can be reported then as a ratio of outputs to inputs or a comparison to optimal productivity using stochastic frontier analysis or data envelopment analysis.

One difficulty in creating a generalized efficiency measure is comparability of outputs. For example, if hospital A discharges 100 people at an average cost of $8000, while hospital B discharges 100 at $7000, the presumption may be that B is more efficient, but hospital B may be discharging patients with poorer health that will require readmission and net higher costs to treat.


## Outputs

Commercial efficiency measure outputs can be put into two broad categories: episodes of care, or population based care.
