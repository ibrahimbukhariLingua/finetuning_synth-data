**Edhance** is a now inoperative American corporation that operated a student discount program prior to its acquisition by BuyWithMe, Inc. The company allowed college students to register up to five existing Visa or MasterCard credit or debit cards and automatically receive discounts when shopping with participating merchants.

The company was founded in 2008 by Bjorn Larsen, KJ Gundersen, and Kris Helenek and was acquired by BuyWithMe, Inc in June 2011.


## Receiving Discounts


### Card model

Edhance uses a registered card model to send discounts to students in the form of automatic cash back. Once a student has registered their card with Edhance any time that student uses that registered card at a participating "card model" retailer, the transaction is automatically sent to Edhance and a discount will be processed into that students Edhance account. Card model discounts are typically between 5% and 25% off.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
