## Company history

UKFast was founded in September 1999 by Welsh businessman Lawrence Jones and his wife Gail Jones.

In 2007, the company moved its head office to the 28th floor of City Tower in Manchester. It acquired further space on the 16th floor, before moving in 2013 to a campus at 1 Archway in the Birley Fields area of Hulme, Manchester.

In 2013, the firm launched eCloud, a range of cloud hosting services whose hardware infrastructure reportedly cost £12 million to build. In that year, the business turned over £23.4 million.
For the year ending 31 December 2014, UKFast reported a 24 per cent turnover increase from £23.4 million to £28.9 million. Between 2011 and 2015, UKFast invested more than £25 million into capital expenditure projects including the development of four data centres and the flagship UKFast Campus.

In 2013, UKFast opened an office in Glasgow and in 2015 opened a further office in London.

In 2014, founder Lawrence Jones rejected a reported £200 million takeover bid amidst a trend of web hosting consolidation, citing that the business was still growing.

In 2016, UKFast doubled the size of its headquarters by securing a further 40,000 sq ft (3,700 m²) of space at 3 Archway, Birley Fields, adjacent to its existing building.

In 2018, a 30% stake of UKFast was sold to private equity firm Inflexion for around £120 million

Jones' wife and current UKFast managing director Gail Jones took over his responsibilities, according to the article.

On 6 May 2020, the Joneses exited the business along with Secarma through a sale to existing private equity investor Inflexion.
