There are ample reasons for the business community to opt for Pakistan having business friendly environment and liberal economic policies to growing infrastructure.


## Ease of doing business

According to the World Bank’s Doing Business Report, 2020, Pakistan is No. 1 in terms of big jump in ranking of Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) among 11 biggest economies. Pakistan is the top reformer in the South Asia and among the top 20 reformers in Ease of Doing Business Reforms (EoDB). The reforms were recognized in the fields of starting a business, trade across borders, getting electricity, dealing with construction permits, registering properties and paying taxes.
