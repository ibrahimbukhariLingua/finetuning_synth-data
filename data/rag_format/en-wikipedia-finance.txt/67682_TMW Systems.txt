## History

Following the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, which deregulated the trucking industry, Tom Weisz founded TMW Systems in 1983.

In 2005, Wachovia Capital Partners and PepperTree Capital Management acquired TMW Systems. In 2006, TMW Systems acquired Vancouver-based Maddocks Systems, Canada's largest provider of trucking software. TMW Systems also acquired Durham-based TMT Software Company, a fleet maintenance software provider, in May 2007. TMW Systems completed its acquisition of Integrated Decision Support Corporation in September 2007. In late 2009, TMW Systems acquired Innovative Computing Corporation of Nashville, an enterprise software company. In May 2011, TMW Systems announced the acquisition of Appian Logistics Softwareâ€”a leading logistics and supply chain software provider.

On August 27, 2012, TMW Systems was acquired by Trimble of Sunnyvale, California for $335 Million in cash.

Today, TMW supplies solutions covering the transportation services sector. It supplies technology for improved operational efficiencies, transactional velocity, resource utilization and long-term profitability.

TMW Systems has customers in the trucking, 3PL, brokerage, private fleet, construction, municipal government, retail repair and waste management industries.
