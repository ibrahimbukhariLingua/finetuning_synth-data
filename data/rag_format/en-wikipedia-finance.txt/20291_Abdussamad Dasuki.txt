Regarding the last motion, when former Speaker Tambuwal defected from the then ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the opposition APC, the PDP-led Federal Government withdrew his security detail and sought to declare his seat vacant. In response to this, Abdussamad Dasuki raised a motion of urgent importance asking that the State House of Assembly condemn these, and, along with two other members, applied for a stay of proceedings in the court case against Tambuwal, seeking to be added as defendants and stating that the constituency cannot be without representation in the House of Representatives.

Following his victory, a petition was filed against him by the defeated PDP candidate. The petition was eventually struck out in September 2015 for lack of merit.

He was sworn in as a Member of the House of Representatives on June 9, 2015, and in October 2015, he was appointed Chairman of the House Committee on Navy. His legislative interests include youth empowerment and rural development.
