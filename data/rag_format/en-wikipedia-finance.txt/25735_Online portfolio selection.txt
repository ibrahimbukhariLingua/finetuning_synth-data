Online portfolio selection


# Online portfolio selection



**Online portfolio selection** (**OPS**) is an algorithm-based trading strategy that sequentially allocates capital among a group of assets to optimise return on investments.

Proponents say that it is designed so that the investor never loses money on stocks. In 2015, it was used by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.


## History

The concept of online portfolio selection originated in 1952 with an essay by Harry Markowitz giving the theory of portfolio selection as Modern portfolio theory. Online portfolio selection was first implemented in 2012 by Bin Li and Bin Hoi at Wuhan University.
