Baskin-Robbins


# Baskin-Robbins



**Baskin-Robbins** is an American multinational chain of ice cream and cake specialty shops owned by Inspire Brands. Baskin-Robbins was founded in 1945 by Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins in Glendale, California. Its headquarters are in Canton, Massachusetts, and shared with sibling brand Dunkin' Donuts. It is the world's largest chain of ice cream specialty stores, with more than 8,000 locations.

The company is known for its "31 flavors" slogan, with the idea that a customer could have a different flavor every day of any month. The logo includes a stylized "31" formed from the letters "B" and "R". The slogan came from the Carson-Roberts advertising agency (which later merged into Ogilvy & Mather) in 1953. The company has introduced more than 1,300 flavors since 1945, including the addition of vegan and non-dairy flavors in 2019.


## History

Baskin-Robbins was founded in 1945 by American brothers-in-law Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins from the merging of their respective ice cream parlors, in Glendale, California.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Burt Baskin learned about ice cream while he was in the military during World War II and opened Burton's Ice Cream Shop in California in 1946. Irv Robbins managed an ice cream counter in his father's store as a teenager and in 1945 used $6,000 to open Snowbird Ice Cream in California.

In 1948, they decided to combine their companies and call it Baskin-Robbins. Snowbird Ice Cream offered 21 flavors; when they merged the number of flavors was expanded to 31.

By 1948, Baskin and Robbins had opened six stores. The first franchise was executed on May 20, 1948, for the store at 1130 South Adams in Glendale (Store #1). In 1949, the company's production facility opened in Burbank. Baskin and Robbins decided to start selling the stores to the managers. In 1953, Baskin-Robbins hired Carson-Roberts Advertising who recommended the adoption of the number 31 as well as the pink (cherry) and brown (chocolate) polka dots and typeface that were reminiscent of the circus. The first store that adopted the new 31 looks was 804 North Glendale Ave. in Glendale in March 1953.

Between 1949 and 1962, the corporate firm was known as Huntington Ice Cream Company. The name succeeded *The Baskin-Robbins Partnership* and was eventually changed back to Baskin-Robbins, Inc. on November 26, 1962. Baskin-Robbins was owned by its founders until it was acquired in 1967 (just before Burt Baskin's death) by United Fruit. In the 1970s, the chain went international, opening stores in Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Australia.

In 1972, the company went public when United Brands sold 17% in an IPO. A year later, the British food company J. Lyons and Co. purchased Baskin-Robbins from United Brands and all public stock. J. Lyons then merged with Allied Breweries, becoming Allied-Lyons in 1978. Allied-Lyons then merged with Pedro Domecq S.A. in 1994, becoming Allied Domecq. Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts comprise Dunkin' Brands, Inc. Dunkin' Brands was part of Allied Domecq until its purchase in 2006 by a group of private equity firms – Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and The Carlyle Group.

In 2006, the company's "BR" logo was updated such that it doubles as the number "31" to represent the 31 flavors, with the "31" formed by the parts of the letters "BR" which are rendered in pink, in contrast to the rest of the logo which is rendered in blue.

In August 2012, Dunkin' Brands became completely independent of the private equity firms.

Baskin-Robbins struggled in the early years of the 2000s to retain business, but opened 36 new shops between 2013 and 2015. Many new Baskin-Robbins shops are co-branded with Dunkin' Donuts, including California's first co-branded location of the two in San Diego, which opened in March 2014.

In 2014, Baskin-Robbins also began selling its ice cream for the first time in supermarkets across the U.S. In July 2017, Baskin-Robbins started adding their locations to delivery service platform DoorDash to deliver ice cream in 22 cities across the United States.

In December 2020, Dunkin' Brands was purchased by Inspire Brands.

Baskin-Robbins debuted an updated logo, alongside the new tagline "Seize the Yay", on April 11, 2022.

Chris Buck and Barack Obama are two notable former employees.
