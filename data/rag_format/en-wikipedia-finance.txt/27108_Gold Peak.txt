## Incident

Workers at GP factories have been routinely exposed to Cadmium dust, an extremely toxic metal used in the manufacture of Nickel-cadmium batteries that can cause kidney failure, lung cancer and bone disease. In 2006 more than 100 female factory workers in southern China attempted to sue their former employers (GP) over suspected cadmium poisoning.

On 24 August 2010, over a hundred workers protested outside GP's factory in Huizhou. GP had promised compensation to workers affected by poisoning but severely reduced the negotiated amount offering a "take it or leave it" situation.

Karin Mak's documentary *Red Dust* follows female workers fighting for medical care from their former employer, China's GP Batteries factory, after suffering years of cadmium poisoning.
