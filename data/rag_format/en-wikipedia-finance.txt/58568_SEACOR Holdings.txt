## History

SEACOR was founded on 7 November 1989 by Charles Fabrikant. In December of the same year, Fabrikant and a consortium of investors acquired NICOR Marine, the marine unit of Nicor Gas, and subsequently rebranded it as SEACOR.

In 1992, the company presented its initial public offering, entering the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CKOR. During the 1990s, Seacor participated in Chile's initiative to construct and operate offshore drilling platforms.

In 2002, Tex-Air, a provider of helicopter services for supplying oil and gas offshore platforms, was purchased. This was followed by the expansion of helicopter operations in 2004 through the acquisition of Era Aviation. In 2005, Seacor acquired Seabulk International Inc., which enabled the company to engage in the transportation of crude oil, including offshore and port towing services.

In March 2012, the company sold National Response Corporation and its affiliated businesses to J.F. Lehman & Company.

In January 2013, the company sold its energy trading division to Par Pacific Holdings. Also in 2013, the helicopter business was spun off as Era Group.

In 2017, the company acquired International Shipholding Corporation, including Waterman Steamship Corporation.

In 2018, the company acquired full ownership of CLEANCOR Energy Solutions LLC, while the company divested its stake in the aviation company Hawker Pacific.

In April 2021, American Industrial Partners, a private equity firm, acquired the company at a value of US$1 billion.
