Iranian capital relocation


# Iranian capital relocation



In 2025, the Iranian government began discussing changing the capital city from Tehran to Makran and Chabahar. This decision, aimed at addressing Tehran’s overpopulation, water scarcity, power shortages, and other ecological pressures, was officially declared by government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani on January 8, 2025. The government has formed two councils to examine the feasibility of the move and develop a sea-based economy in the Makran region.

It is expected to cost 77 to more than $100 billion US dollars to be accomplished.


## Background

The idea of moving the capital has been discussed periodically since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but was previously abandoned due to economic constraints and logistical challenges. The current administration under President Masoud Pezeshkian is revisiting the proposal, citing strategic and economic benefits for the move. However, critics have raised concerns about the enormous financial and logistical demands associated with such a relocation.

The move is intended to shift the country’s economic and political center closer to the sea, enhancing Iran’s trade capabilities and reducing the burden on Tehran.

Makran is a largely undeveloped region. Name Makran means palm tree.

In the post-Islamic era before Qajari moving of capital to Tehran in 1795, Mashhad was the political capital, the Safavids had picked Isfahan to be their capital in 1598.


## Timeline
