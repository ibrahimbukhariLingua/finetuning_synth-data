EDreams ODIGEO


# EDreams ODIGEO



**eDreams ODIGEO** (sometimes referred to as simply "eDreams") is a Spanish online travel company that was formed in 2011 as the successor of eDreams with the merger of online travel agencies eDreams and GO Voyages, and the acquisition of Opodo (which included Travellink).

It has more than 21 million customers in 44 countries with 40,000 destinations and nearly 700 airlines. The company sells flights, hotels, vacation packages (flight and hotel), train tickets, car rentals, and travel insurance. Its headquarters are in Madrid with more than 1,700 employees worldwide.


## History

In 2010, Axa acquired Go Voyages and Permira acquired eDreams. Axa and Permira merged eDreams and GO Voyages, which jointly acquired Opodo in 2011.

eDreams ODIGEO was created in June 2011 when eDreams merged with GO Voyages and Opodo, the three largest European online travel agencies, through two private equity firms, AXA Private Equity and Permira Funds. eDream's co-founder, Javier Perez-Tenessa, became the president of the holding group. By March 2014, the company reached €500 million in sales.

eDreams ODIGEO announced an intention to list on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, and Valencia stock exchanges in early 2014. On April 8, 2014, the company completed its initial public offering on the Bolsa de Madrid, at 10.25 euros per share, which valued the company at around $1.5 billion. This was the first ever initial public offering of an internet startup in Spain. The sale of shares was managed by financial organizations including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, and Jefferies Group LLC. It was the first company to go public in Spain since 2011. However, after five months, the stock price had fallen by 60%, reflecting the shared challenges of a difficult European IPO market. The stock later stabilized, with significant gains in share price including 160% gain in 2016.

In January 2015, eDreams announced that former Chief Operating Officer Dana Dunne was promoted to CEO. Previous CEO Javier Perez-Tenessa became honorary chairman. That December, Odigeo opened new offices in Barcelona on Bailén Street.

The company received industry awards including "Best Online Travel Partner Global 2015" (CFI.co), "Best Flight Booking Website 2015" (British Travel Awards), and "Best international Expansion" (eAwards – EMOTA).

In June 2016, it launched free intelligent push notifications on mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, so that travelers can be notified of any flight delays, cancellations, and diversions as well as gate announcements and baggage claim areas.

eDreams ODIGEO acquired the BudgetPlaces brand and portfolio from EnGrande in January 2017.

After completing a strategic review in November 2017 compiled by Morgan Stanley, it was announced that Odigeo was considering takeover bids in January 2018. In March 2018, it was reported that Odigeo would not accept the unsolicited offers from potential investors. The company announced that it would transform its business model based on income diversification and price policy change.

In May 2018, eDreams ODIGEO released a flight cancellation guarantee, allowing customers to cancel their flights on the day of the scheduled flight and receive an 80% refund of the ticket price for any reason. The policy gives travelers flexibility through the availability of a refund, with a maximum refund limit per person.

### COVID-19 travel trends report

eDreams ODIGEO uses booking data to predict the next year’s travel trends. In 2020, it used data from 17 million customers to reveal the most booked destinations for the following year. In 2021, Lisbon was the most booked destination for European travelers.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 saw a shift in Europeans favoring short-haul flights over long-haul flights as travel remained uncertain. During the pandemic, customers booked their flights and holidays less in advance than in other years. In the summer of 2020, 33% of travelers booked their flights 0–5 days before departure, compared to 2019 when the most popular time period to book travel was 31 days in advance.


### Consumer booking preferences report

In 2021, eDreams ODIGEO commissioned an independent poll with OnePoll to reveal traveler booking preferences post-COVID-19. 10,000 adults from 8 countries were surveyed to understand how consumers book online travel. The findings from the poll revealed that 75% of respondents expressed a preference to book via an OTA as opposed to direct with an airline due to convenience and cost.


### Best time to book annual study

eDreams ODIGEO produces an annual study of the best time of year to book a flight, based on bookings made through their websites in the previous years.

The best time to book a study is published on Opodo, one of the eDreams ODIGEO brands. In 2020, the study found that the cheapest month for booking a flight was January.


## Corporate affairs

The leadership team includes Dana Dunne (Chief Executive Officer), David Elizaga (Chief Financial Officer), and Gerrit Goedkoop (Chief Operating Officer) as well as Carsten Bernhard (Chief Technology Officer).

Thomas Vollmoeller serves as chairman and Javier Perez-Tenessa is honorary chairman. The Board of the Company includes Thomas Vollmoeller, Carmen Allo, Dana Dunne, David Elizaga, Daniel Setton, Lise Fauconnier, Benoit Vauchy, Pedro López, and Amanda Wills.


## Criticism


### Involvement in Israeli settlements

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of all business enterprises involved in certain specified activities related to the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Golan Heights. eDreams ODIGEO and its subsidiary company, Opodo, have been listed on the database in light of their involvement in activities related to "the provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements". The international community considers Israeli settlements built on land occupied by Israel to be in violation of international law.
