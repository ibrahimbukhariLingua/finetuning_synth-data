Following that, Stambekov along with his partners launched the Alacard project, introducing smart cards to the gas station market in Kazakhstan for corporate clients. This initiative was notably successful, marking the first use of smart cards in the country's financial and fuel sectors.

During the early 2000s, Stambekov ventured into the oil and gas sector. He initially served as the first deputy director of the RSE Main Dispatch Department of the Oil and Gas Complex under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. In 2001, he progressed to the role of first deputy director general of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. During the period of 2001 to 2003, Stambekov served as the general director of ALA Data Systems Ltd.

## Political career

Stambekov first entered politics in 1989 as a legislator of the Alma-Ata City Council of People's Deputies. He was given the responsibility of heading the Commission on Youth Affairs, Physical Education and Sports, Afghan Warriors, and became a member of the city council under Äkim Zamanbek Nurkadilov.

In March 2016, Stambekov was elected as a deputy of the Almaty City Mäslihat from the No. 25 constituency of Jetisu District. He served in the position until resigning on 3 April 2018 citing reasoning "a number of international projects" as his reason for stepping down.

Stambekov had been a member of the ruling Nur Otan party since 2000, before officially leaving in 2019 due to disagreements with the party's direction and the Kazakh government's handling of the 2019 presidential election protests.


### Member of the Mäjilis

On 29 March 2023, Stambekov officially assumed office as a deputy of the 8th convocation of the Mäjilis, where he became a member of the Committee on Finance and Budget.


#### Elections

**2023**

In the 2023 legislative election, Stambekov ran as an independent candidate for the Electoral district No. 4 seat, representing the city of Almaty. During the election, the constituency remained competitive as several polls varied data of candidates receiving support no more than 7%. Stambekov was viewed as one of lesser candidates by political observers. Despite the general outlook, Stambekov secured the constituent seat, winning 15,930 votes (20.7%) in the crowded race. This led to challenge of the election results by his runner-up challenger Sanjar Boqaev, who accused Stambekov in illegally winning a rigged vote. Boqaev, in possession of allegedly compiled 101 election protocols, showed Stambekov of only winning 2,825 votes and taking third place in race behind Konstantin Malinovsky. Stambekov slammed claims by Boqaev and his campaign team as "harassment and manipulation." In an interview to *Ulysmedia.kz*, Stambekov voiced his confidence on the election integrity and that "everyone had equal and fair conditions", not ruling out the possibility of debating Boqaev over the disputed results of the constituency vote.

During one of the interviews he gave during his 2023 pre-election campaign, Stambekov, while referring to the people who died during the 2022 Kazakh unrest, claimed that he "swore on their blood" that the country would see changes and everything wouldn't just "boil down to simple slogans", and that he wouldn't just "do nothing" if it was going otherwise. These words were later criticized by a human rights activist Alnur Ilyashev as insensitive and contradictory to Stambekov's prior political stance. Ilyashev also claimed that by being elected to Parliament, Stambekov would "unfortunately" only promote and become part of the system built by Nursultan Nazarbayev.


## Other activities

Stambekov is said to be actively engaged in charity, leading the Paryz charitable foundation since 2004 and managing various projects aimed at aiding children's expensive surgeries. He also hosts tourist events like the annual festival Toiqazan, celebrating the national cuisine of Kazakhstan's people. In a 2016 interview to *Tengrinews.kz*, Stambekov expressed his interest in developing Toiqazan festival similarly to the Oktoberfest.

He initiated the annual Alma-Qala apple tree planting campaign in 2014 and organized public hearings on conversion of Almaty CHP-2 to natural gas by the AlES company.
