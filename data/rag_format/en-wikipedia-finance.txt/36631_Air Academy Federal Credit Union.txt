## History

Chartered in October 1955, Air Academy Credit Union (AACU) was originally created to serve the cadets, officers, and civilians of the newly established United States Air Force Academy at Lowry Air Force Base. As the Air Force Academy grew and evolved, so did its membership. Today, they not only serve all active and retired military service members and their families, but they also serve employees, students and families of 10 school districts and hundreds of local businesses (also called select employee groups (SEGs)) and their family members.
