**Funeral payments** are a social security payment in the United Kingdom that are part of the Social Fund. They are to help with the costs of a funeral. To be eligible for a funeral payment, a claimant or their partner must be in receipt of one of the following income related benefits:

* Income Support
* Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
* Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
* Pension Credit (guarantee or savings credit)
* Housing Benefit
* Working Tax Credit (disability or severe disability element)
* Child Tax Credit (at a rate higher than £545 per year)
* Universal Credit

## England and Wales

In England and Wales, further entitlement conditions must also be met. A claimant can get a Funeral Expenses Payment if:

* they live in England or Wales;
* they were the partner of the person who died;
* they were a close relative or close friend of the person who died *and* it is reasonable for them to accept responsibility for the funeral costs, because they were in close regular contact with the person who has died.

A *close relative* means

* a parent, father-in-law, mother-in-law or step-parent
* a son, son-in-law, step-son or step-son-in-law
* a daughter, daughter-in-law, step-daughter or step-daughter-in-law
* a brother or brother-in-law
* a sister or sister-in-law

If there is another close relative of the person who has died who is not getting a qualifying benefit, their situation may need to be considered.

A claimant cannot get a payment as a close relative or close friend of the person who has died if:

* the person who has died had a partner when they died;
* there is a parent, son or daughter of the person who has died who is not getting a qualifying benefit

 and whose relationship with the person who has died had not broken down.
