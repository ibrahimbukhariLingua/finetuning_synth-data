## Aliens Space Station Story

Rising immensely in prominence in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the group ran into controversy due to delay in delivery of flats in - Aliens Space Station 1. This project was conceived in 2009 and pre-booking started in 2008. The project's construction got stalled later due to uncertainties caused due to various politico-economic changes, the global economic depression in 2009 and the major hammer blow of the state bifurcation. Increasing costs, inflation and public pressure led the group to deliver one station consisting of 8 towers while halting the sales and construction of the remaining units.

In 2016, post an exhaustive audit, Aliens Group managed to raise Rs. 200 crore funding from ECL Finance Ltd, the non-banking financing arm of Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd which helped to resume construction in Space Station and closing out pending cases through compensating aggrieved customers.

The project again ran into trouble owing to the funding partner liquidity concerns following the IL&FS NBFC scandal. Following this, the group received a boon in the form of a low cost fund - SWAMIH by SBI Caps. The fund pre-approved the funding request in 2021 and provided final approval to Aliens Group's Space Station Project for a substantial INR 332 cr post following a thorough due-diligence via auditing firms in 2023.

The Group is currently looking to complete and handover the Space Station Township project in Q4 2026 basis SBI Cap Estimates. Meanwhile, the once aggrieved Aliens Group is also growing in the plotted development category with its massive Hillstation, Golf-Based development - Aliens HUB.
