Sema acquired LHS Inc. in 2000, by the amount of $4.7 billion, and subsequently, in 2001, Sema was taken over by Schlumberger by the amount of 5.2 billion, the resulting entity was then renamed SchlumbergerSema.

In 2003, Schlumberger withdrew from all sectors except its core sector of oilfield services and equipment. Its telecoms business was separated into a product house maintained by Schlumberger and a systems integration business, which was sold to Atos Origin for $1.5 billion.

In 2004, General Atlantic, LLC and LHS Acquisition GmbH, both amongst the original shareholders of LHS Group Inc., acquired the product house from Schlumberger.
