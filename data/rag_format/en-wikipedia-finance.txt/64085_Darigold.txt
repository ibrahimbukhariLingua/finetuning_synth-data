**Northwest Dairy Association** (formerly the **Northwest Dairymen's Association**; trading as **Darigold, Inc.**) is an American dairy agricultural marketing cooperative. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, it is owned by about 350 dairy farm members of the association located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.


## History

The cooperative was founded in 1918 as the **United Dairymen's Association**, and it bought the **Consolidated Dairy Products Company** in 1930. A contest among dairy families produced the cooperative's brand name, "**Darigold**" in 1920. In 1999, the cooperative, in an effort to improve its marketing position, changed its name to **Northwest Dairy Association**, while changing the corporate name to **WestFarm Foods**. In 2006, the corporate name returned to **Darigold**. In 2010, the cooperative merged with the Montana dairy cooperative **Country Classic**. The co-op's annual sales are over $2.0 billion, and production is over 8,600,000,000 pounds (3.9×10⁹ kg) of milk a year. In August 2003, Darigold locked out their union in one production facility. Workers in that facility continue to be represented by a union, as are employees in most Darigold production facilities.

In June 2021, Darigold announced plans to build a multi-million production facility in Pasco, Washington, that represents significant investment in climate-friendly modernization. In 2022, the co-op shared details of a leadership transition with Stan Ryan, its CEO of six years, announcing his retirement and Darigold executive Joe Coote named CEO.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
