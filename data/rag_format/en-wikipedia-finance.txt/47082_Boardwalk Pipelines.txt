## History

Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004.

These two interstate natural gas pipeline companies were consolidated into a new entity – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009.

In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merged into Gulf South in 2015.

In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana.

In 2014, Boardwalk acquired Evangeline ethylene pipeline system, further expanding Boardwalk's service offerings to petrochemical customers. Boardwalk Field Services, LLC develops and operates gas gathering, compression, dehydration, treating, and processing infrastructure, and in June 2013 placed its processing plant into service.

In 2018, Loews Corporation acquired Boardwalk so that it became a subsidiary company, with its stock being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2021 the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled for the former partners in the case *Bandera Master Fund LP et al v Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP et al* which awarded them $690M, but the case is being appealed.
