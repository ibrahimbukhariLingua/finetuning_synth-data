Statements on Auditing Standards (United States)


# Statements on Auditing Standards (United States)



In the United States, **Statements on Auditing Standards** provide guidance to external auditors on generally accepted auditing standards (abbreviated as GAAS) in regards to auditing a non-public company and issuing a report. They are promulgated by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which holds all copyright on the Standards. They are commonly abbreviated as "**SAS**" followed by their respective number and title.

With the permission of the AICPA, the full text of Standards 1–101 has been posted on the website of the Digital Accounting Collection at the J.D. Williams Library of the University of Mississippi. Links to these full-text records appear in the List of Statements of Auditing Standards below.
