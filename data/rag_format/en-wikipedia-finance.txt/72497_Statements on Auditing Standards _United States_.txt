Statements on Auditing Standards (United States)


# Statements on Auditing Standards (United States)



In the United States, **Statements on Auditing Standards** provide guidance to external auditors on generally accepted auditing standards (abbreviated as GAAS) in regards to auditing a non-public company and issuing a report. They are promulgated by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), which holds all copyright on the Standards. They are commonly abbreviated as "**SAS**" followed by their respective number and title.

With the permission of the AICPA, the full text of Standards 1â€“101 has been posted on the website of the Digital Accounting Collection at the J.D. Williams Library of the University of Mississippi. Links to these full-text records appear in the List of Statements of Auditing Standards below.
