# Clément Juglar



**Clément Juglar** (15 October 1819 – 28 February 1905) was a French medical doctor and statistician.


## Juglar cycles

He was one of the first to develop an economic theory of business cycles. He identified the fixed investment cycle of six to ten years that is now associated with his name. Within the Juglar cycle one can observe oscillations of investments into fixed capital and not just changes in the level of employment of the fixed capital (and respective changes in inventories), as is observed with respect to Kitchin cycles.


## Juglar's impact

Juglar's publications led to other business cycle theories by later economists such as Joseph Schumpeter.
