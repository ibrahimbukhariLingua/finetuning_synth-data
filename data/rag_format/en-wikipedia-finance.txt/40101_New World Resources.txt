## History

Regular mining activities in Silesia in the northeast region of the Czech Crown lands commenced in 1782 and were then nationalized in 1946. The company was established on privatisation of elements of the coal industry of the Czech Republic which started in 1994; in 2004 46% of the business was bought up by *Karbon Invest* which itself was acquired by *RPG Group* (owned by Mr Zdenek Bakala, a Czech billionaire), shortly thereafter. In 2005 the coal and coke businesses of that company were restructured as *New World Resources B.V.* and were the subject of an initial public offering as *New World Resources N.V.* in 2008. In 2013 NWR sold its coke subsidiary, OKK Koksovny, a.s.

In September 2018, Bakala filed a lawsuit in federal court in Beaufort, South Carolina in which he claims that a controversional Slovak businessman Pavol Krúpa has initiated frivolous lawsuits, promoted death threats on Facebook and instigated criminal investigations targeting him. The lawsuit also says that Krupa threatened to send soccer hooligans to protest in front of Bakala's home in Switzerland and ultimately demanded a payment of 500 million Czech koruna (US$23 million) in 2017, as a compensation for losses suffered by buying the New World Resources stock, to stop. According to the complaint, when Bakala rejected that offer, Krupa hired Beverly Hills, California-based Crowds on Demand “to bring his campaign of defamation, extortion, and harassment to the U.S.”ᶜⁱʳᶜᵘˡᵃʳ ʳᵉᶠᵉʳᵉⁿᶜᵉ
