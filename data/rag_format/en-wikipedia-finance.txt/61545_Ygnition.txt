## History

Ygnition was founded in September, 2001 as a broadband Internet services company, acquiring the assets of a number of bankrupt or distressed broadband service providers. In late 2003, Ygnition launched cable television service at a number of its apartment communities and apartment building owners or developers of condominiums which previously allowed them to be the exclusive provider of certain services to residents of the apartments and condos. Ygnition will bundle Internet and VOIP service with its cable TV offering if the contract allows. These exclusivity contracts were made illegal by FCC ruling 07-889 on October 31, 2007. Cable companies have tried to fight this law but the ruling was upheld May 26 of this year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.gg

As of 2007, Ygnition has Internet access available to 150,000 apartment units and Cable television service available to 50,000 units across seven states.

As Ygnition extends its market through acquisitions, it is also expanding the services offered. Ygnition is expanding into the VOIP market through partnerships with various VOIP wholesalers. Ygnition purchases cable and satellite television service from providers like DISH network and others, then redistributes them through their networks. Internet service is delivered to its service locations from anywhere from a single T1 to OC3 or ethernet over fiber, however multiple T1 circuits is the most common method.

Ygnition uses traffic shaping to prioritize voice over IP (VOIP) traffic. Traffic shaping gives higher priority to latency sensitive communication (VOIP) by delaying latency insensitive communication (large file transfers).
