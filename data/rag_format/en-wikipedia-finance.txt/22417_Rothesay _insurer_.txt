## History

Rothesay was founded by Addy Loudiadis in 2007, as a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs. Its first transaction was a buy-out of Rank Group's £700 million pension scheme, in 2008.

In 2019, Rothesay completed a buy-out of the GEC 1972 Pension Scheme, worth £4.7 billion, at the time the largest bulk annuity transaction ever completed.

In 2019, Rothesay entered into an agreement with Prudential to take on its £12 billion annuity business. This transfer was blocked in the High Court. In 2021, on appeal, the decision was overturned, allowing the transaction to go ahead.

In 2024, Rothesay acquired Scottish Widows's £6 billion bulk annuity portfolio.
