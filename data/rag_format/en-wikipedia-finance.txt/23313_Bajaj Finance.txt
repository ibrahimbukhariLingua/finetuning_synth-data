## History

Originally incorporated as Bajaj Auto Finance Limited on March 25, 1987, as a non-banking financial company, primarily focused on providing two and three-wheeler finance. After 11 years in the auto finance market, Bajaj Auto Finance Ltd launched its initial public issue of equity share and was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India. At the turn of the 20th century, the company ventured into the consumer durables finance sector and started offering small-size loans. In the subsequent years, Bajaj Auto Finance diversified into business and property loans as well.

In 2006, the company's assets under management hit the ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million). In 2010, the company's registered name changed from Bajaj Auto Finance Limited to Bajaj Finance Limited. In its first seven years, Bajaj Finance mainly borrowed wholesale and lent retail. Since 2014, it has also borrowed retail and lent wholesale, diversifying its liability profile.

By 2015, BFL had set up a series of Disaster Recovery (DR) data centers for business continuity. Additionally, by 2020, it had started using data analytics and big data tools.

In January 2023, Bajaj Finance launched its loan against property (LAP) business for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) customers. By 2020, 60% of Bajaj Finance's workload was on cloud and originally, they aimed to create a super-app for existing customers, but due to COVID-19 pandemic in India, they expanded the plan to encompass various services by integrating five proprietary marketplaces within their ecosystem—EMI store, insurance, mutual funds, broking, and health.

As of September 30, 2024, money markets made up 47% of company's borrowings, bank borrowings 29%, deposits 20%, and external commercial borrowings 4%. Deposits grew 21% YoY to ₹66,131 crore (US$7.7 billion).


## Operations

As of March 2023, the company deals in consumer lending, SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) lending, commercial lending, rural lending, deposits, and wealth management. And, across 3800 towns, it has 294 consumer branches and 497 rural locations with over 33,000+ distribution points and 1,50,000+ stores.

Most of Bajaj Finance's revenue is generated from suppliers who pay for access to their larger customer base. As of December 2024, mortgages currently make up 31% of its consolidated AUM, while SME lending accounts for 14% and commercial lending for 13%.

In the past, Bajaj Finance had been working with RBL Bank and DBS Bank to issue co-branded credit cards. But, in early December 2024, the company ended its partnerships due to new Reserve Bank of India rules restricting the role of non-banking partners in such agreements.

## Financials

In the year 2021, an analysis using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was conducted to examine the relationship between revenue factors and non-performing assets (NPA) parameters in Indian non-banking financial companies. Specifically, when studying Bajaj Finance, it was observed that there existed a statistically significant positive correlation between revenue and gross NPA (P<0.04), profit after tax (PAT) and gross NPA (P<0.04), as well as return on assets (ROA) and gross NPA (P<0.005), with a negative correlation found in the latter case.

In a study conducted in 2023, examining 30 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, which was subsequently published in the *European Economic Letters* journal, it was found that Bajaj Finance stock reached a maximum average return of 58.58%.

## Regulatory

In September 2022, the RBI included Bajaj Finance as one of the 16 NBFCs that are part of the NBFC-Upper Layer list.

### Compliance issues

In November 2023, RBI banned the company from approving or distributing loans through two of its lending services, namely 'eCOM' and 'Insta EMI Card'. In an exchange filing in May 2024, the company announced that the RBI had lifted the said restrictions following remedial actions taken by the company.
