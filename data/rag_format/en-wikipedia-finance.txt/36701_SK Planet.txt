SK Planet


# SK Planet



**SK Planet Co., Ltd.** (Hangul: SK 플래닛 or 에스케이 플래닛), a subsidiary of SK Telecom, was established in 2011. It is an internet platform development company located in Pangyo, South Korea’s Silicon Valley, with operations in eight countries. SK Planet was spun off from SK Telecom to focus on online services and has since evolved to concentrate on three core business areas: e-Commerce, Online-to-Offline services, and digital marketing.


## Products and Business Services

Since its inception, SK Planet has owned, operated, and developed a variety of digital products and services, including those related to business, entertainment, financial technology, social media platforms, mobile messaging, location-based services, mobile commerce, and marketing.

**E-Commerce**

SK Planet owns and operates **11st.co.kr** – an e-Commerce shopping website in South Korea. Here, online buyers can purchase goods and services from sellers through its online marketplace platform. As of 2016, 11st.co.kr became South Korea’s most visited e-Commerce site and is number one in mobile commerce, with the highest number of monthly unique visitors among mobile shopping apps in Korea. SK Planet then expanded 11st.co.kr into new international markets, with its first global venture being **N11.com** in Turkey in 2013. Subsequent expansions included **Elevenia** in Indonesia in 2014, **11street Malaysia** in 2015, and **11street Thailand** in 2017.

**Online-to-Offline Services**

**OK Cashbag** is South Korea’s most widely used integrated loyalty program, allowing customers to earn points across various retailers and redeem those points for goods, services, and discounts at over 60,000 merchants. It boasts 38 million subscribers on its marketing platform.

**Syrup** is a singular brand of multiple consumer mobile apps in South Korea specializing in online-to-offline services, including:

* **Gifticon**: Launched in 2006 as Korea’s first mobile voucher service, enabling users to purchase digital vouchers and send them as gifts, which can then be redeemed at the point of sale.
* **Syrup Wallet**: A mobile wallet service using BLE and geo-fencing technology to provide users with membership promotions and discounts from over 400 brands, and also serves as a digital wallet for membership cards.
* **Syrup Table**: A mobile app focusing on food and beverage establishments, providing crowd-sourced reviews about local restaurants, nearby promotions and discounts, as well as pre-ordering services.
* **Syrup Style**: A curated fashion app where users can browse through apparel, shoes, bags, and accessories, purchase them directly, and then have them delivered or picked up at the offline store.
* **Syrup Pay**: A web-based payment solution where users register their payment preferences, such as credit card, bank transfer, or mobile carrier billing, to pay for their purchases and then enter a passcode to complete transactions.

In November 2024 SK Planet announced a cooperation with Animoca Brands Mocaverse to introduce blockchain innovations into SK Planet’s existing digital services ecosystem, enhancing the user experience with decentralized features.
