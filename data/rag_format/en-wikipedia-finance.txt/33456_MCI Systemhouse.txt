# MCI Systemhouse



**MCI Systemhouse, Inc.**, was an American information technology company that specialized in data centers for large corporations. It was a subsidiary of the Washington, DCâ€“based MCI Communications Corporation, the result of a 1995 $1 billion acquisition of Canadian company **SHL Systemhouse** and its subsequent integration with MCI's technical services branch. The new company was formed to provide systems integration and outsourcing services. **SHL Systemhouse** based in Ottawa, Ontario, had revenue of $1.2 billion Canadian dollars in 1994, or about $883 million at then current exchange rates.

On February 11, 1999, MCI Systemhouse was acquired by EDS of Plano, Texas, for $1.65 billion. EDS was able to recoup almost 25% of the purchase price by selling SHL Systemhouse's stake in Commerce One for $400 million in January, 2000. Prior to the acquisition, MCI Systemhouse was one of several entities that formed UML Partners, a group devoted to the development of the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
