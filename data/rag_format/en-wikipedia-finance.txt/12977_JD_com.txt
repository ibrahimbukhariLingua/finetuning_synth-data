## History


### Early years

The company was founded in 1998 as Jingdong.

In 2004, the company's B2C site went online as jdlaser.com. The company began using the domain name 360buy.com, and the name was changed to Jingdong Mall in 2007.

Since 2009, JD.com has set up a customer service center in Suqian, cumulatively investing over 30 billion RMB to build its self-operated customer service center. As a result, the company now operates the industry's largest customer service team.

On 10 December 2010, JD's founder Liu Qiangdong announced through his Weibo account that every book sold on JD.com would be priced at 20 percent cheaper than its competitors. On December 14, 2010, Dangdang also began to offer discounts to customers and stated that the company would invest 40 million Chinese yuan to give discounts to customers. As a result, JD.com launched the second promotion to sell books at a lower price than Dangdang and announced that it would give coupons instead of reducing prices to protect the benefits of publishers. In November 2011, JD.com provided its customers with a 10 percent discount on books, while Dangdang sent promotional messages to its users. The sudden increase of orders not only caused network errors but also postponed transits of books.

JD.com started the e-book selling business online on 20 February 2012, and provided customers with more than 80,000 electronic books. On 17 April 2013, most of the e-books on Dangdang's website were free for users to download. Consequently, Dangdang launched its flagship store on JD.com in 2023.

In 2013, the company's domain name was changed to JD.com.
