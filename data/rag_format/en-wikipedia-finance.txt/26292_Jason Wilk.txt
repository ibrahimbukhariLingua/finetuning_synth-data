## Career


### Early career

Wilk's first business venture was a retail website for golf equipment called 1DaySports.com. He sold the website for $100,000 and used the money for a backpacking trip across several continents. Wilk also founded a startup called AllScreen. It was funded by Y Combinator. AllScreen was a video distribution network for media companies to easily share their content and ad revenue with other websites to achieve more views . The company was also backed by celebrity venture capitalist Mark Cuban. Mr. Cuban invested in several of Wilk's ventures and had a big impact on Wilk's career after they met at the TechCrunch 40 conference around 2010. While AllScreen was still in stealth mode, he cofounded a company called WriteyBoard that sold stick-in whiteboards to startup companies. AllScreen sold to Zealot Networks in 2015 for $85 million.


### Dave

Wilk founded digital banking upstart, Dave, with co-founders Paras Chitrakar and John Wolanin in 2016. The startup was inspired by Wolanin's prior frustration with overdraft fees According to Wilk, he had more than 120 meetings with venture capitalists, attempting to get financial support for Dave from investors that do not themselves experience overdraft fees. Dave grew to 10 million members within 5 years and $122 million in annual revenues by 2020, using subscriptions and optional tips as its business model, instead of overdraft fees. Wilk is largely credited with the disruption of overdraft fees in American banking.

Families”. In 2021, Dave was ranked the fifth fastest growing company in America on the Inc5000 list. In January 2022, Wilk took the company public on NASDAQ at a valuation of close to $4 billion.
