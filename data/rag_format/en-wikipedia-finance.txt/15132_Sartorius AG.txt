## History

**1870** At the age of 24, Florenz Sartorius founded the "Feinmechanische Werkstatt F. Sartorius" in Göttingen.

**1906** By acquiring the companies August Becker (Göttingen) and Ludwig Tesdorpf (Stuttgart), Sartorius expanded its portfolio to include microtomes as well as astronomical, geodetic, and physical instruments.

**1969** Sartorius tested moon rock collected during the Apollo 11 mission.
