Show Me the Money 777


# Show Me the Money 777



The seventh season of the series *Show Me the Money*, known as ***Show Me the Money 777*** (also referred to as ***SMTM777***), premiered on September 7, 2018, and ended on November 9, 2018. It is on broadcast every Friday at 23:00 KST on Mnet.

This season features judges Swings and Giriboy from Just Music, Deepflow and Nucksal of Vismajor Company (VMC), Paloalto of Hi-Lite Records and Code Kunst of AOMG, and The Quiett of Illionaire Records and Changmo of Ambition Musik.

Different from previous seasons, this season does not have the first preliminary round. Instead, the production crew watched over 13,000 audition videos and selected about 1,000 contestants. These selected contestants then were judged by the producers teams, and the qualified ones will move on to Round Two.

There is a new betting system that is used this season. 200 million won (the winner's final prize money) will be equally divided among the four producer teams (50 million won for each team) prior to Round Two, and can be used to evaluate each passed rapper's rap in the round.

The winner of this season was Nafla with Team Just Music's Swings and Giriboy as the winning producers.

Chains are handed to contestants that have passed to the next round. 140 contestants advanced to the next round.

* Round Three: **Fight Money Battle Round + Revival Round** – The bets each rapper received from Round Two has been carried forward to this round. Different from the 1-on-1 Rap Battles that have been used in previous seasons, for this round, there can be a triple battle. MC Kim Jin-pyo will randomly pick a card with a rapper's name, and contestants that want to battle against this picked rapper can step forward to ask for a battle. The picked rapper will then pick one of the rappers for a 1-on-1 rap battle. A triple battle is established if a picked rapper picks two of the rapper challengers, or when one rapper wants to go up and join an already set 1-on-1 rap battle. The winner of each triple battle will take all the money of the two other rappers in each triple battle, and the latter two will also be eliminated from the show. In the event of a tie, a sudden death 1-on-1 match will be held to determine the winner. Selected rappers that were eliminated in this round will participate in the 1-on-1 revival round, where the winner of each 1-on-1 battle will advance to the next round, the Group Battle. The winner of each Revival Round battle will receive 100,000 won as Fight Money.

In the Rapper Open Evaluation Round, the judges, notably Swings, asked him to remove the mask, knowing that it was Mad Clown all along.
