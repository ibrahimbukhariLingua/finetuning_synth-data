# Infor



**Infor** is a multinational company headquartered in New York City that provides industry specific, enterprise software licensed for use on premises or as a service.

As of 2016ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Infor's software had 58 million users, and 90,000 corporate customers in 200 countries. Those customers include Bausch & Lomb, Heineken, Wyndham Hotels, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health and Best Western International.


## History

Infor was spun
out from Malvern, Pennsylvania based Systems & Computer Technology Corp in June 2002, as Agilisys, when there were 1,300 customers of its process manufacturing ERP software. It grew through acquisitions backed by Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners.

With the addition of German company Infor Business Solutions AG in 2004, Agilisys changed name to Infor Global Solutions. It relocated headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia to New York in 2012.


### Micro-verticals and cloud

From 2010, Infor marketed "micro-verticals," which were versions of its software adapted for specific industries. It claimed these products were easier to implement than those of its competitors.

Infor introduced an Amazon Web Services based product called CloudSuite in 2014.


### Koch Industries

In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 2⁄3 ownership.

Subsequently, in February 2020, Koch bought out Golden Gate Capital's remaining minority shareholding. The transaction valued Infor's assets at $11 billion.
