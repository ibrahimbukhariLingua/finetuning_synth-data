**Robert Luciano** (born 1974) is an Australian fund manager, best known as the founder of VGI Partners. Luciano's wealth in 2019 would have qualified him for the Financial Review Rich List.


## Business career

Luciano broke into funds management after recommending as an analyst at Prudential-Bache that clients buy shares in the Australian Securities Exchange when it converted from a co-operative into a listed company. The contrarian recommendation gained the notice of Caledonia Investments, which subsequently hired Luciano. Luciano identified another opportunity in the exchanges industry at Caledonia, buying into the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after it shifted from a co-operative to a listed company, which became one of Caledonia's best investments.

Luciano founded VGI Partners in 2008. VGI was best known for its short positions against Slater & Gordon, jeweller Pandora, Hannesbrands and Corporate Travel Management. Its case against Slater & Gordon that it was inflating revenues pushed the law firm's share price from $A8 to less than 30c.

Luciano, who describes himself as not being good with people, has a combatant and direct management style.

A 2022 opinion piece in the *Financial Review* claimed that Luciano was "paranoid" about personal and information security. Luciano requests any hotel he stays in to shut down wifi for the entire floor his room is on. Luciano’s other security measures include travelling with bodyguards and an airport security gate at VGI’s office.

In 2021 VGI came under pressure from activist investors for its declining performance and the mismatch between the share price and the value of the assets in its listed portfolios. The activists said Luciano lacked appeal for retail investors and that VGI fund VG1’s fees were too high.

In 2022 VGI merged with Regal Funds Management to become Regal Partners. Regal Chief Investment Officer Philip King said the merger would allow Luciano to return his focus to investing rather than managing.

A VGI shareholder described the merger as a "shotgun marriage". The merger marked the death of Luciano’s control of VGI, according to an activist investor.

Luciano was replaced as portfolio manager of the VGI Asian investment fund by Philip King in 2022.

In November 2023, Luciano resigned from VGI Partners. Luciano registered two new businesses, RML Partnership and Rosca Capital Management, in 2024, stating he had begun managing money again for his family.


## Personal life

Luciano’s father, a professional hotel piano player, moved to Australia with his family before Luciano was born. Luciano’s mother was a school teacher.

Luciano has homes in the Sydney suburbs of Mosman and Palm Beach. He is married.
