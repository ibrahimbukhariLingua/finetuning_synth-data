## Early life and education

Schweitzer is the son of Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 1963 to 1973. He is the grandnephew of Albert Schweitzer, and so related to Jean-Paul Sartre.

Schweitzer has a degree in law and is a graduate of France's elite *Institut d'études politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)* and *École nationale d'administration*.


## Career


### Career in the public sector

Schweitzer was appointed Inspector of Finance at the French Treasury in 1970. In 1981, he became Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Laurent Fabius in his various government posts (Budget Minister, Minister for Industry and Research and Prime Minister).


### Career in the private sector

Schweitzer joined Renault in 1986 and became Chief Financial Officer and Head of Strategic Planning in 1988.

Schweitzer was appointed Executive Vice President and COO in 1989, and President and COO in 1990. He was Renault's Chairman and CEO from May 1992 to April 2005, and president of the Renault-Nissan Alliance Board from 2001 to 2005. On 29 April 2005, he became Chairman of the Renault Board of Directors.

Schweitzer is a Commander of the French *Légion d'honneur* and National Order of Merit, and director of several French and foreign companies. He is also member of governing boards of various general organisations, particularly in the cultural field.

Since 6 March 2005, Schweitzer has been President of the *Haute Autorité de Lutte Contre les Discriminations et Pour l'Égalité*. This role was entrusted to him by the French President.

## Controversy

In 1995, the Justice Ministry investigated Schweitzer for being an "accomplice in poisoning" of hemophiliacs. The case stemmed from his tenure as Chief of Staff to Laurent Fabius and whether he knowingly allowed blood infected with HIV to be distributed to recipients. In 2003, the Court of Cassation dismissed the charges against him and several other officials.

Schweitzer was found guilty in 2002 of conducting surveillance on the phone of Jean-Edern Hallier as part of a special unit of the Elysée Palace and fined. The Court of Cassation upheld his conviction in 2008.
