## History


### Founding as Citizens National Bank

S.J. Irvine, Sr. founded the bank in 1878 under its original name, Citizens National Bank, in the oil boomtown of Evansburg, Pennsylvania (now Evans City, Pennsylvania). The bank received a state charter in 1893 and its national charter in 1907.

In 1940, S.J. Irvine, Jr. succeeded his father as president. In 1959, S.J. Irvine III, began his career as bank president. In 2000, his daughter, Margaret Irvine Weir, became president of the bank, representing the fourth generation of the Irvine family to head the company.


### Name change to NexTier

On October 11, 2005, the bank officially changed its name to NexTier Bank. It also adopted the tagline "Experience The Next Level." The name change resolved a dispute with the much larger Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, which had 400+ branches, compared to Citizens National Bank's 15 branches.
