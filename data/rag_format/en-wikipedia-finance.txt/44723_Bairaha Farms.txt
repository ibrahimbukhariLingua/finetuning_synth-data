During the late 1990s, animal feed manufacturing in Sri Lanka was dominated by three companies. Bairaha Farms was one of them, operating together with Cargill. Bairaha Farms-Cargill joint venture controlled 10% of the animal feed market share and 10% and 30% market shares in layer day-old chicks and broiler day-old chicks.

The company signed an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and received a 10-year tax holiday for the project.
