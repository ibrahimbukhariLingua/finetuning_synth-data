# Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation



**Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation** (PIDC) (Urdu: پاکستان ہیئت برائے ارتقائے صنعت) is a state corporation of Pakistan working under Ministry of Industries and Production.


## History

Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) was founded as a state corporation under Pakistan's Ministry of Industries and Production in April 1951. It began operations in 1952. The PIDC board of directors included members of industrial families such as Naseer A. Sheikh of the Colony Group, Adamjee Group, and Syed Amjad Ali of the Wazir Ali Group. Its constitution articulated a primary objective of promoting industry rather than state ownership, with a policy to engage private capital and gradually transition its share capital to private investors.

Muhammad Ayub Khan invigorated PIDC which initiated new industries using government capital and sold them to private businessmen once they became profitable. Its strategic disinvestment policies significantly influenced the growth of major industrial conglomerates, particularly in East Pakistan, where groups such as Adamjee, Dawood, Amin, Crescent, Isphani, and Karim benefited from these policies by establishing large-scale industrial operations. In West Pakistan, notable projects included the Saigol Group's acquisition of the Jauharabad Sugar Mill and the Dawood Group's takeover of Burewala Textile Mills. PIDC facilitated the expansion and dominance of these industrial houses in Pakistan's economy, particularly in the jute and textile industries.

PIDC was created to set up industries in such fields where large capital was required and was difficult for the private sector and to set up industries in such backward areas to creating employment opportunities.
