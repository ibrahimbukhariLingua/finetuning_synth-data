## Hippodrome

An office building and parking garage built on the site of the New York Hippodrome in 1951-52 uses the name "The Hippodrome Center." Through the 1960s, the modern building was the corporate headquarters of the Charter Communications media publishing company. The building at 1120 Avenue of the Americas between 43rd and 44th Streets in Midtown Manhattan was acquired by the Gottesman family in 1978. A $55 million major modernization of the 21-story building was completed in 2006. Executive Suites offers 160 executive offices, including single rooms and multi-room suites for between one and ten people, and there are also nine conference rooms, accommodating up to 40 people.

Completed in 2007, the building’s amenities include a resident’s lounge and billiards room, fitness center and yoga studio, concierge, security system, and building-wide wireless internet system. The building also houses a mini storage location. It has two commercial retail spaces at street level. One houses NYC's famous il laboratorio del gelato, a small ice cream factory founded in 2002 on the lower east side.


## WorkSpace Offices

WorkSpace Offices, located at 131 Varick Street in the Hudson Square area and at 5030 Broadway, in Inwood, offers 206 units for a less formal but highly entrepreneurial group of users. Offices can accommodate between one and 20 people. Both buildings contain mini storage facilities.

In 2021, StorageMart acquired WorkSpace Offices from Edison Properties as part of the same deal that included Manhattan Mini Storage.
