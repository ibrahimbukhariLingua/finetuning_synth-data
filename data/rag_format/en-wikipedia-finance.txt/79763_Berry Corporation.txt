### 1993 oil spill

In December 1993, an oil pipeline owned by the company leaked, resulting in a spill of 84,000 gallons of heavy crude oil into McGrath Lake, near Oxnard, California. Berry had acquired the 40-year-old pipeline from Chevron Corporation in 1990 after it had been abandoned for 10 years. The line had been used to transport natural gas, Berry began to pump crude oil through it without making any upgrades. Ten months before the oil spill occurred, a safety valve that might have prevented the leak had broken and was not repaired. In August 1994, Berry agreed to pay $600,000 and pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to report the leak. In addition, the foreman on duty during the spill pleaded no contest to a charge of illegally releasing oil into marine water and was ordered to perform 320 hours of beach cleanup. The civil case from the state attorney general's office was settled in January 1997, when the company agreed to a $3.2 million fine.
