## Functions

In August 2015, TuneIn launched a premium service called "TuneIn Premium" that covers audiobooks, sports content from MLB, NHL, NFL, NBA, news content from MSNBC, Al Jazeera, and more. Initially, subscribers were able to record any content played through the TuneIn service, but the feature was first discontinued in the UK in early 2017, with a global discontinuation following on September 14, 2020, citing legal issues. However, the feature remains accessible through older versions of the TuneIn Pro app.

In March 2018, TuneIn launched another premium live audio subscription called "TuneIn Live," which offers play-by-play calls from thousands of live sporting events, plus access to premium news stations, talk shows, and other content. The company launched the subscription-based radio service exclusively for Alexa-enabled speakers, allowing subscribers to prompt Alexa to stream news programs as well as play-by-play broadcasts of MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL games. TuneIn Live marked the first time TuneIn premium content was available over a voice platform.

On December 22, 2015, the National Hockey League (NHL) announced that TuneIn would gain radio rights to the NHL.

Additionally, TuneIn would create a replay channel for each team so fans could listen to the archived games. They would also create a 24/7 NHL Channel, and the NHL would embed TuneIn's players onto the NHL.com website. All TuneIn NHL items would be made available to the public for free. The first broadcasts for TuneIn began on January 1, 2016.

## Legal issues

In 2017, TuneIn was sued by Sony Music UK and Warner Music UK, alleging copyright infringement by offering access to international radio stations not licensed for distribution in the United Kingdom. The companies also took issue with a feature in its premium tier, which was later disabled in the country, that allowed users to record broadcasts. In November 2019, the English High Court ruled that, despite TuneIn's arguments that the premium feature in question was merely an aggregator similar to a search engine, the TuneIn service infringed the labels' rights by making streams not licensed in the country available to its users (an infringement of the exclusive right to communicate a work to the public, under EU copyright law). The court granted a request for an appeal.

In September 2020, TuneIn began to geoblock all international radio stations for users in the United Kingdom, citing the earlier court order.

On March 29, 2021, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision, ruling that TuneIn infringed the right of communication to the public.

In May 2022, TuneIn removed United Kingdom stations that were not registered with the music licensing bodies PRS and PPL.
