# TMX Finance



**TMX Finance** is an American company that provides consumer loans and payday loans through its subsidiaries including TitleMax, TitleBucks, EquityAuto Loan, SpeedyCash.com, *Community Choice Financial* and InstaLoan. The company holds more than 900 stores in over fourteen states including Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin, and an online presence in Idaho. TMX Finance’s brands serve individuals who generally have limited access to consumer credit from banks, thrift institutions, credit card lenders, and other traditional sources of consumer credit.

TitleMax markets easy cash to borrowers with “good credit, bad credit, or no credit” secured by the title to their car. In Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin – which have all passed lending laws – those loans have come with zero percent interest.

After 30 days, however, the loan is due in full. If the borrower cannot pay –TitleMax’s average loan is for $1,300 – the borrower is sent to another TitleMax location outside of the city, where he or she can receive a new, unrestricted loan. The borrower would be free to renew the loan at that location indefinitely. That loan, states a contract given to one borrower, could have an annual rate as high as 310 percent.

TMX is owned by Tracy Young of Savannah, Georgia.

## Industry overview

Customers use the services provided by the alternative financial services industry for a variety of reasons, including that they often: do not have access to traditional credit-based lenders like banks, thrift institutions, and credit card companies; have a sudden and unexpected need for cash due to common financial challenges like medical emergencies, vehicle repairs, divorce, job changes, or other unexpected expenses; are self-employed small business owners with an immediate need for short-term working capital; need a small amount of cash immediately and do not have time to wait for a traditional lender to approve a loan; and see such services as a sensible alternative to potentially higher costs and negative credit consequences of other alternatives, such as overdraft fees, bounced check fees, or late fees.


## Bankruptcy Exception in Georgia

In July 2023, ProPublica reported that in Georgia, TitleMax had won a 2017 federal court case that enabled the company to sidestep protections normally available under Chapter 13 bankruptcy. "Normally, Chapter 13 ... clears some debts and reduces payments on others through a court-approved repayment plan that the debtor can afford." The court ruled that title loans operated under state pawn shop laws. TitleMax charges more than 100% interest per year on car title loans.
