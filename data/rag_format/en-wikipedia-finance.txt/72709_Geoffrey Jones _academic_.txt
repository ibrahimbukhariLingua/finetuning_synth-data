## Work

Jones initially researched relationships between business and governments. He published historical monographs on the oil industry and international banking. From the 1980s, Jones, alongside Mark Casson, was also involved in calling for a more theoretical approach to business history, particularly in the use of economic theory. During this period he wrote historical studies of industries over long time periods, including *British Multinational Banking 1830-1990* (Oxford, 1993) and *Merchants to Multinationals* (Oxford, 2000). *Merchants to Multinationals* was awarded the Newcomen-Harvard Prize for the best business history book published in the United States between 1998 and 2000, and the Wadsworth Prize for the best work of business history published in Britain in 2000. After moving to Harvard Business School, Jones published books on the history of global business, including *Multinationals and Global Capitalism* (Oxford, 2005). In 2010, Jones published *Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry* (Oxford, 2010). In this book, and elsewhere, Jones has sought both to explain the growth of the beauty industry and to explore its impact over the last century on homogenizing beauty ideals worldwide.He has written Harvard Business School cases on leading entrepreneurs in the industry, including the iconic Helena Rubinstein, the founder of the American luxury cosmetics sector. Recently Jones has focused on the history of green business and sustainability, and has written on the societal responsibilities of capitalism. In addition to the Creating Emerging Markets project, he has also researched the business history of emerging markets, including Latin America and Turkey. Jones and co-authors have called for the business history of emerging markets to be mainstreamed in the discipline as a whole, and seen as an alternative business history rather than merely adding new settings to explore established core debates Jones has encouraged international business scholars to test theories against historical evidence. In 2006 he and Tarun Khanna published a widely cited article in the Journal of International Business Studies, the premier international business journal, on this issue. More recently Jones and Khanna have published on the importance of corporate reputation in emerging markets, employing data from the Creating Emerging Markets project.

Jones has warned of the risks to the world economy of economic nationalism and populism. In 2017, Jones suggested the world economy was undergoing a process of de-globalization.
