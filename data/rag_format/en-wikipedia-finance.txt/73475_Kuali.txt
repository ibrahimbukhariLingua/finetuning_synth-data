# Kuali



Kuali Inc. is a Software as a Service (SaaS) company focused on creating software for higher education, developed with significant input from the academic community. Partnering with several hundred higher ed institutions, Kuali offers a range of software, including a no-code forms and workflow, curriculum management, research administration, financial management, and business continuity planning.


## History

The inception of the Kuali community can be traced back to 2004 when the Kuali Project was initiated by the University of Hawaii, Indiana University, rSmart, and The National Association of College and University of Business Officers (NACUBO). The project received its initial funding of $2.5 million from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, providing the initial impetus.

In 2005, recognizing the need for a more structured approach, the Kuali community evolved into a non-profit organization, officially known as the Kuali Foundation. This transition emphasized the community's dedication to serving the specific needs of higher education, "for education, by higher education."

A significant development occurred in August 2014 when the Kuali Foundation announced the launch of its for-profit commercial entity. This marked a transition as Kuali re-licensed and assumed responsibility for the development of the Kuali community software, moving it to the cloud. The shift to the Software-as-a-Service model was well-received. The Kuali foundation considered its mission accomplished and disbanded in 2023, noting the extensive adoption of Kuali software by educational institutions.
