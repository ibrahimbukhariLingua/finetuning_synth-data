## Biography

Tsang was born in Hong Kong in 1950. He was influenced by translation works by Franz Kafka and Karl Marx in his young and studied philosophy and political science at the University of Hong Kong and was vice-chairman of the Hong Kong University Students' Union. He was one of the leader of student movements against the colonial injustice during the 1970s and was one of the organisers of the anti-corruption campaign at that time. He was the editor of *Socialist Review* and *Sensibility*, two left wing journals during that time which introduced the student activists New Left, existentialist and Frankfurt School theories.

He later obtained a Master of Business Administration degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and worked as a credit analyst, a gold and foreign exchange dealer, and a treasury assistant. He later rejoined the academia, studying his Doctoral degree at the University of Manchester, where he met his future wife, and ending up as an economics professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University, teaching Intermediate Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, the Chinese Economy, and Money and Finance in China.
