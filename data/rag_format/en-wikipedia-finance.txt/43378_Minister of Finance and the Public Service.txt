## Constitutional Responsibilities

According to the Constitution of Jamaica, the minister with responsibility for finance should sit on a committee to determine the terms of service (including salary and allowances) of the Clerk and Deputy Clerk of Parliament.

The Minister of Finance shall, prior to the conclusion of each financial year, prepare and lay before the House of Representatives the annual estimates of revenue and expenditure for public services for the subsequent financial year.


### Authorisation of expenditure

The Minister of Finance shall, at the earliest convenient moment in each financial year, introduce in the House of Representatives an Appropriation Bill outlining the estimated expenditures, categorized by service, for the upcoming financial year, excluding statutory expenditures.

Whenever actual or projected expenditures in a financial year exceed the allocated sum for a service or relate to a new service not provided for in the Appropriation Act, the Minister of Finance shall prepare and lay before the House of Representatives statements of excess or supplementary estimates for voting. Upon approval, the Minister may introduce a Supplementary Appropriation Bill to cover the voted expenditures.

Prior to the end of each financial year, the Minister of Finance may introduce Supplementary Appropriation Bills to cover approved supplementary expenditures. Following the end of each financial year, the Minister shall introduce a final Appropriation Bill incorporating any previously unaccounted expenditures.


### Meeting Expenditure

If Parliament is dissolved before making necessary provisions for Jamaica's government, the finance minister can issue warrants to pay necessary sums from the Consolidated Fund. This ensures public services continue for up to three months after the House of Representatives reconvenes. The minister must then present a statement of authorized sums to the House for approval, and these sums will be included in the next Appropriation Bill.


### Auditor General Department's Audit

The Minister responsible for finance shall audit and report on the Auditor-General's department accounts, following the same procedures as the Auditor-General's audits and reports.
