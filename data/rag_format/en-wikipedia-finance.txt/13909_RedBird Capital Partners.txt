In August 2019, RedBird acquired a minority stake in YES Network, after helping Yankee Global Enterprises activate their buy back option to purchase Fox's 80% share for $3.5 billion after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox during the same year after the Department of Justice ordered Disney to sell the network on antitrust grounds due to its ownership of ESPN. On August 31, 2022, the company completed the acquisition of AC Milan from the US fund Elliott Investment Management for €1.2b. RedBird also owns Toulouse FC, a club from the city of the same name that plays in Ligue 1 since 2020 and acquired a minority stake in Liverpool F.C. in 2021.

In August 2020, the company acquired the assets of the XFL for $15 million, along with Dany Garcia and Dwayne Johnson, from the brand's founder, Vince McMahon.

In June 2023, former media executive Jeff Zucker joined as an executive at a RedBird subsidiary co-owned with International Media Investments (IMI), a state-funded enterprise of the United Arab Emirates owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The joint venture, known as RedBird IMI, allows IMI to invest in RedBird's sports and entertainment properties.

In December 2023, RedBird announced a merger between the XFL and USFL to be called United Football League (UFL) starting in 2024. In July 2024, the company funded Skydance Media's acquisition of National Amusements from the Redstone family, a purchase that also includes a controlling stake in Paramount Global.

On 23 November 2024, Sky News reported that CVC Capital Partners, TF1, RedBird Capital Partners, All3Media, Mediawan and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had been linked to a potential takeover bid for ITV plc and a possible break-up of core assets such as ITV Studios and ITVX.

On 30 January 2025, Reuters reported that RedBird IMI were in early-stage talks with ITV plc to merge the All3Media and ITV Studios production businesses.
