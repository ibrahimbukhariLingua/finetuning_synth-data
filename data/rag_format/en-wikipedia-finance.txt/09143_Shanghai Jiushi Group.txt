## History

In 1986, Shanghai Government was allowed to use a maximum of US$3.2 billion foreign currencies through borrowings which was the catalyst of establishing **Shanghai Jiushi Corporation** (Chinese: 上海久事公司). According to the company, the name 久事; *Jiǔshì* had the same pronunciation of 94 (pinyin: *Jiǔsì*), which was the issue number of the document of the State Council regarding the use of such foreign currencies. The company was incorporated on 12 December 1987 under the Law on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People (Chinese: 全民所有制工业企业法). The Company Law of China was legislated in 1993.

Jiushi Group used the fund in Shanghai Metro, as well as other projects such as the renovation of Shanghai Hongqiao Airport.

In 2015 the company was re-incorporated as **Shanghai Jiushi (Group) Co., Ltd.**, under the Company Law of China.
