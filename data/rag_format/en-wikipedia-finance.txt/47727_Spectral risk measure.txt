Spectral risk measure


# Spectral risk measure



A **Spectral risk measure** is a risk measure given as a weighted average of outcomes where bad outcomes are, typically, included with larger weights. A spectral risk measure is a function of portfolio returns and outputs the amount of the numeraire (typically a currency) to be kept in reserve. A spectral risk measure is always a coherent risk measure, but the converse does not always hold. An advantage of spectral measures is the way in which they can be related to risk aversion, and particularly to a utility function, through the weights given to the possible portfolio returns.


## Definition

Consider a portfolio {\displaystyle X} (denoting the portfolio payoff). Then a spectral risk measure {\displaystyle M\_{\phi }:{\mathcal {L}}\to \mathbb {R} } where {\displaystyle \phi } is non-negative, non-increasing, right-continuous, integrable function defined on {\displaystyle [0,1]} such that {\displaystyle \int \_{0}^{1}\phi (p)dp=1} is defined by

where {\displaystyle F\_{X}} is the cumulative distribution function for *X*.

If there are {\displaystyle S} equiprobable outcomes with the corresponding payoffs given by the order statistics {\displaystyle X\_{1:S},...X\_{S:S}}. Let {\displaystyle \phi \in \mathbb {R} ^{S}}. The measure
{\displaystyle M\_{\phi }:\mathbb {R} ^{S}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } defined by {\displaystyle M\_{\phi }(X)=-\delta \sum \_{s=1}^{S}\phi \_{s}X\_{s:S}} is a **spectral measure of risk** if {\displaystyle \phi \in \mathbb {R} ^{S}} satisfies the conditions

1. Nonnegativity: {\displaystyle \phi \_{s}\geq 0} for all {\displaystyle s=1,\dots ,S},
2. Normalization: {\displaystyle \sum \_{s=1}^{S}\phi \_{s}=1},
3. Monotonicity : {\displaystyle \phi \_{s}} is non-increasing, that is {\displaystyle \phi \_{s\_{1}}\geq \phi \_{s\_{2}}} if {\displaystyle {s\_{1}}<{s\_{2}}} and {\displaystyle {s\_{1}},{s\_{2}}\in \{1,\dots ,S\}}.

## Properties

Spectral risk measures are also coherent. Every spectral risk measure {\displaystyle \rho :{\mathcal {L}}\to \mathbb {R} } satisfies:

1. Positive Homogeneity: for every portfolio *X* and positive value {\displaystyle \lambda >0}, {\displaystyle \rho (\lambda X)=\lambda \rho (X)};
2. Translation-Invariance: for every portfolio *X* and {\displaystyle \alpha \in \mathbb {R} }, {\displaystyle \rho (X+a)=\rho (X)-a};
3. Monotonicity: for all portfolios *X* and *Y* such that {\displaystyle X\geq Y}, {\displaystyle \rho (X)\leq \rho (Y)};
4. Sub-additivity: for all portfolios *X* and *Y*, {\displaystyle \rho (X+Y)\leq \rho (X)+\rho (Y)};
5. Law-Invariance: for all portfolios *X* and *Y* with cumulative distribution functions {\displaystyle F\_{X}} and {\displaystyle F\_{Y}} respectively, if {\displaystyle F\_{X}=F\_{Y}} then {\displaystyle \rho (X)=\rho (Y)};
6. Comonotonic Additivity: for every comonotonic random variables *X* and *Y*, {\displaystyle \rho (X+Y)=\rho (X)+\rho (Y)}. Note that *X* and *Y* are comonotonic if for every {\displaystyle \omega \_{1},\omega \_{2}\in \Omega :\;(X(\omega \_{2})-X(\omega \_{1}))(Y(\omega \_{2})-Y(\omega \_{1}))\geq 0}.

In some textsʷʰⁱᶜʰ? the input *X* is interpreted as losses rather than payoff of a portfolio. In this case, the translation-invariance property would be given by {\displaystyle \rho (X+a)=\rho (X)+a}, and the monotonicity property by {\displaystyle X\geq Y\implies \rho (X)\geq \rho (Y)} instead of the above.


## Examples

* The expected shortfall is a spectral measure of risk.
* The expected value is *trivially* a spectral measure of risk.
