Money (Lisa song)


# Money (Lisa song)



"**Money**" is a song by Thai rapper and singer Lisa from her debut single album *Lalisa* (2021). It was released to US contemporary hit radio by Interscope Records on November 9, 2021, as the second single from the album. The lyrics for the track were written by Bekuh Boom and Vince, with music being composed by them alongside 24 and R.Tee. It is an American rap style track over a laid-back horn beat with boastful lyrics about spending money and being rich. The song marked Lisa's final release as a soloist under YG and Interscope, before her departure from the labels in December 2023.

"Money" achieved commercial success worldwide and peaked at number ten on the Billboard Global 200, becoming Lisa's second top-ten hit and the longest-charting song at the time by a K-pop soloist. It reached number one in Malaysia and entered the top ten in the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Singapore, and Slovakia. The track figured within the record charts of 26 countries, and became the longest-charting song at the time by a K-pop female soloist on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart among others. It received mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented Lisa's rap skills and confidence but criticized the song's composition and lyrics.

An exclusive performance video for "Money" was directed by Lee Sang-yoon and uploaded to Blackpink's YouTube channel on September 24, 2021. It surpassed one billion views in 2024, making Lisa the second female K-pop soloist and third overall to achieve the feat. The song has since been certified diamond in Brazil and gold in France, Poland, Portugal and Spain, and earned a Guinness World Record in 2023 for being the first K-pop track by a solo artist to reach one billion streams on Spotify.


## Background and release

On August 25, 2021, YG Entertainment announced that Lisa would make her solo debut with the single album titled after her given name, *Lalisa*. "Money" was confirmed as the B-side track on the tracklist of the single album on September 5. The song was released alongside the album on September 10, and received a performance video on September 24. Following its release, "Money" trended on TikTok and Instagram Reels in the form of dance covers, transformation edits, and edits to the television series *Squid Game*, and began to rise in the international charts. In response to its viral success, the song was sent by Interscope Records to US contemporary hit radio as the second single from the album on November 9, 2021.


## Composition

The song's lyrics were written by Bekuh Boom and Vince, and music was composed by them alongside 24 and R.Tee. Lyrically it is a boastful song about being rich and spending cash. The song is composed in the key of E minor and carries a tempo of 140 beats per minute, and is described as a dynamic hip hop song. Nolan Feeney from *Billboard* explained the music of the song is close to the "contemporary American rap" and is "built around a languid horn loop."


## Critical reception

"Money" received mixed to positive reviews, with Lisa's performance and rapping receiving praise; on the other hand, some criticized the song's composition and lyrical content. Rhian Daly of *NME* criticized the lyrics as "cringe-y at best" and the sound as "obvious, safe and boring." In a more positive assessment, Starr Bowenbank of *Billboard* named "Money" the 20th best K-pop song of 2021 and stated that the track exhibits the "full extent of her rap skills, star power and crossover appeal." It was also included in *Teen Vogue*'s list of the best K-pop songs of 2021, with Maddy Myer stating that "from the start, this song draws the listener in" and that it "has all the confidence Lisa is known for."


## Performance video

On September 20, 2021, the release of a "exclusive performance video" for "Money" was announced, which was directed by Lee Sang-yoon. Initially scheduled for the release on September 23, at 12 a.m. KST, the release was postponed by a day because of the delay in the post-production of the video due to the Chuseok holiday. It became the fastest K-pop performance video to reach 500 million views on YouTube, doing so in less than six months. On May 27, 2024, the performance video surpassed one billion views on YouTube, Lisa's first video as a soloist to reach the milestone. With this, she became the second Blackpink member and the third solo K-pop artist in history to have a music video reach one billion views, after Psy's "Gangnam Style" (2012) and bandmate Jennie's "Solo" (2018). A dance practice video was released on October 11, 2021, which topped the worldwide trending list on YouTube and reached 10 million views in one day.

In the performance video, Lisa along with the backup dancers gives a choreographed performance for the song in two inter-changing settings. The video starts with Lisa dancing in the middle of an abandoned airstrip taxiway wearing a khaki-colored ensemble and green Celine chest. A billboard reading "money is a terrible master but an excellent servant" beams in the background. In the other setting, Lisa wears a checkered crop top and bralette combo, red tap shorts, and fur boots performing in a warehouse with a white LED screen at the back.
