Moneyhelpline


# Moneyhelpline



**Moneyhelpline**.com was an independent price comparison service which provided consumers with free, impartial advice on a variety of financial products including credit cards, mortgages, loans and a range of insurance types.

It stopped trading in 2018 after its parent company Fundraising Innovations was taken over by private equity company, Inflexion Capital Partners LLB.


## Business model

**moneyhelpline's** comparison services were powered by Beatthatquote at first and then later by Lovemoney.com, Seopa and The Broker Team, other comparison providers. **moneyhelpline** made money by earning commission from each customer who took out a financial product through them, making the service free to the consumer.


## Company history

The company was founded in 2002 as Fundraising Innovations Ltd trading as switchandgive.com and stopped providing services in 2018.

moneyhelpline was one of a group of web properties owned by Fundraising Innovations Ltd, which also includes energyhelpline - comparing gas and electricity tariffs and heating insurance, greenhelpline - comparing green energy solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ, and firsthelpline - comparing broadband and home phone services.

Of these, as of 2022, only energyhelpline continues to trade.
