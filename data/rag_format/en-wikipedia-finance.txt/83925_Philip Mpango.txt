## Political career

Mpango was nominated by president John Magufuli to serve as a member of the Tanzanian parliament. The constitution allows the president to nominate up to ten members of parliament.

On 23 December 2015, President John Magufuli appointed Mpango as Minister of Finance and Planning. In 2020, Magufuli reappointed him to the office. Mpango has been credited with improving the Tanzanian economy by an average of 6 to 7 percent during his five years as finance minister.

During the coronavirus pandemic, after Seif Sharif Hamad, First Vice President of the semi-autonomous region of Zanzibar, had died after contracting the virus,
and after President Magufuli had admitted that Tanzania had a coronavirus problem, Mpango "appeared coughing and gasping at a press conference" that was held to address rumors that he had died of the coronavirus, shocking many and drawing widespread condemnation.

President Magufuli's subsequent death was announced on 17 March 2021, resulting in Vice-President Samia Suluhu being sworn in as his successor on 19 March 2021, and her nomination on 30 March 2021 of Mpango to the vice-presidential office that she had vacated.

At the time he was confirmed for the position of vice-president, in March 2021, he was the incumbent MP for the constituency of Buhigwe in Kigoma Region of northwest Tanzania.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ According to the laws of the country, once he was appointed VP, he ceased to be an MP and his parliamentary seat fell vacant. Mpango has stated that he planned to combat corruption and continue implementing major infrastructure projects, including a new standard gauge railway.
