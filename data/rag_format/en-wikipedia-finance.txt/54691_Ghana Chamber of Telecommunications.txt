Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications


# Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications



The **Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications** is an umbrella organization that regulates and promotes the interests of telecommunication companies in Ghana. Kwaku Sakyi-Addo was the Chief executive officer for the first six years of its existence. He resigned in April 2017. The Chamber is headed by Ing. Kenneth Ashigbey


## Activities and Initiatives

The Chamber of Telecommunications has assured that all deactivated unregistered Subscriber Identification Modules (SIMs) can still be registered. The chamber stated that once users complete the registration process using their Ghana Card and provide biometric data to the mobile operator, the data on the deactivated SIM cards will be restored immediately. According to Dr. Kenneth Ashigbey, the CEO of the Chamber of Telecommunications, as of Thursday morning, three million unregistered SIM cards had been deactivated, and there is a possibility of an additional six million being deactivated soon.

Dr. Ashigbey emphasized that users of deactivated SIM cards are currently unable to make or receive calls, send or receive text messages, access internet services, or perform mobile money transactions. However, they can still receive messages from their mobile operators and access the registration code, which is \*404#. He urged everyone to take advantage of the registration window since the authorities are not interested in blocking people's numbers but are focused on removing fraudulent individuals from the system.

The SIM card registration campaign began on October 1, 2021, and was initially scheduled to end on March 31, 2022. However, due to challenges faced by individuals in obtaining the Ghana Card, the National Communications Authority (NCA) extended the registration deadline multiple times until May 31, 2023, which was communicated as the final deadline.

Dr. Ashigbey also highlighted that approximately 7.4 million mobile money accounts, holding a total of GHc200 million, have not been registered and will be deactivated. The funds in blocked accounts will be kept in a special account, and owners of restored mobile money accounts will need to go through a process to have their funds restored in their wallets. He advised those without a Ghana Card to obtain one from the National Identification Authority, use the registration code after receiving the card, and complete the registration to regain their numbers.

The telecommunication industry in Ghana contributed GH¢4.3 billion in taxes to the economy in the previous year, accounting for 7.7% of government revenue. The sector also played a crucial role in reducing unemployment, creating 6,100 direct jobs and 1.2 million indirect jobs. These figures were revealed during the launch of the Mobile Industry Transparency Initiative 2021 by the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications.

The breakdown of taxes included GH¢883.6 million of corporate income tax (CIT), GH¢657.4 million of value-added tax (VAT), and GH¢571.4 million of levies such as the national health insurance levy (NHIL), Ghana Education Trust Fund levy (GETFL), and COVID-19 levy. Withholding tax (WHT) amounted to GH¢722.2 million, while communication service tax (CST) and pay as you earn (PAYE) contributed GH¢424.7 million and GH¢138.1 million, respectively. Additional taxes paid by operators totaled GH¢266.7 million.

The CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications, Dr. Kenneth Ashigbey, highlighted the telecom sector's critical role in nation-building and urged policies that foster its growth instead of threatening its survival. He expressed concerns about the tax regime, which he felt was negatively impacting investments in the sector. Dr. Ashigbey emphasized the need to reevaluate taxes such as the COVID-19 levy and the national fiscal stabilization levy, which distort the market and discourage investment.

Dr. Ashigbey acknowledged the challenges faced by telecom operators, leading to the closure of some businesses. He cited the merger between Airtel and Tigo as an example of companies seeking to maximize revenue and reduce costs. He urged the public to recognize the telecom industry as a driving force for positive change.

Additionally, the mobile financial services sector employed 442,000 registered agents and had 17.9 million active customers by the end of 2021. The industry mobilized GH¢9.7 billion in float balance through mobile money (MOMO), with daily transaction volumes reaching GH¢11.6 million. Taxes paid by the mobile financial services industry amounted to GH¢272 million.

A Senior Manager at the Tax Unit of KPMG emphasized the importance of supporting the telecommunications industry, describing it as a major sector that could contribute to boosting the economy. He emphasized the need to invest in the sector and retain talent to sustain the industry's positive impact on companies and the overall economy.


### Advocacy for Woman in participation of STEM Related Activities

Communications and Digitalization Minister Ursula Owusu-Ekuful has emphasized the importance of increased female participation in Ghana's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) ecosystem for economic growth. Quoting the Council on Foreign Relations, she highlighted how greater involvement of women in STEM careers can help close the gender pay gap and potentially boost women's cumulative earnings by US$299 billion over the next decade, thereby accelerating global economic development. To address the gender gap within Ghana's STEM ecosystem, the 'Seats for Ladies in STEM' initiative (S4LIS) was launched by the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications.

Minister Owusu-Ekuful emphasized that any government-led development agenda must prioritize interventions that tackle educational inequality and promote inclusivity in the workforce. The Ministry has been actively supporting this agenda through initiatives like 'Girls-in-ICT,' encouraging girls to pursue careers in the ICT industry. The Minister expressed satisfaction with the Chamber's concentrated effort to achieve near-gender parity in the field of STEM within the next five years, recognizing its significance for national development.

Collaboration was highlighted as crucial by Minister Owusu-Ekuful, who called upon all stakeholders in the STEM ecosystem, including her fellow ministers and state agencies, to participate in bridging the gender gap. She further suggested that the S4LIS initiative be aligned with the Digital Economy Policy, which places digital skills as a critical pillar. The Chairperson of the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications and CEO of Vodafone Ghana, Patricia Obo-Nai, echoed the need for deliberate policies and strategies to encourage more women's active involvement in STEM. She introduced the 'Seats for Ladies in STEM' initiative as a means to fast-track Ghana's sustainable development in STEM, aiming to increase the percentage of women in STEM-related jobs from 30% in 2021 to 40% by 2031 through various initiatives.

Together, these efforts strive to create a more diverse digital workforce, foster growth and innovation, and benefit all members of society. The initiatives aim to impact the lives of many young women, empowering them and creating opportunities for future generations.
