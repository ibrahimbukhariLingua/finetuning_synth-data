# JMEV



**Jiangxi Jiangling Group New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd.** (traded as **JMEV**) is a joint venture headquartered in Nanchang, China, and owned by Groupe Renault (as a majority holder), Jiangling Motors Corporation Group (JMCG) and China Agricultural Development Construction Fund Corporation. JMEV is focused on the development and production of electric cars and was established in 2015 as a subsidiary of JMCG. It was reorganised as a joint venture in July 2019, after Renault acquired a majority stake.

As of 2023, its cumulative sales of electric vehicles have exceeded 100,000.


## History

In 2014, Jiangling Motors announced the creation of a branch centred on electric cars. On 15 January 2015, Jiangling Motors Corporation Group established a new subsidiary called JMEV. The first car produced by JMEV, the E100, entered production at a Nanchang plant that same year. In 2016, the company opened an electric vehicle test and development centre and started production of a new car, the E200. That year, it got certifications from the government to produce electric cars. In 2017, the company launched two models: the E160 and E200S. It also got permission to produce and sell cars independently of JMCG. In April 2018, the company began building a new production base at Kunming with the capacity to assemble up to 100,000 cars per year. That year, JMEV launched the E400. In October 2019, the Kunming plant started producing EX5s.

In December 2018, French manufacturer Renault announced it would acquire a "significant" JMEV stake. In July 2019, Renault completed the acquisition of a 50% JMEV stake through capital increase while JMCG and China Agricultural Development Construction Fund Corporation kept a 37% and 13% respectively. The company was reorganised as a joint venture.
