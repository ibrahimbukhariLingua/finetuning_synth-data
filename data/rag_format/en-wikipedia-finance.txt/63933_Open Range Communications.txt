Open Range Communications


# Open Range Communications



**Open Range Communications** was a Colorado-based telecommunication company providing wireless broadband infrastructure for rural communities. The company developed and marketed WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network products. In 2008 it was awarded a $267 million loan from the Rural Utilities Serviceâ€™s broadband program to supply broadband services (of which $73.5 million was provided to the company) in addition to $100 million in finance from JP Morgan Chase. The company filed for bankruptcy on October 6, 2011.


## Broadband provision

The company was incorporated in 2004 and was headquartered in Greenwood Village, Colorado. On 9 January 2009, the company announced an investment of $100 million from One Equity Partners (OEP), the private equity arm of JP Morgan Chase.

In March 2008, the United States Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Utilities Program (RDUP) approved a $267 million *Broadband Access Loan* for Open Range, with the prerequisite that private financing also be secured. The OEP investment satisfied the RDUP's loan terms, making the funds available to Open Range.


## Bankruptcy

Open Range Communications voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 6 October 2011 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In court filings, the company stated that it intended to use the bankruptcy process to *"effectuate either (i) a section 363 sale of substantially all of its assets as a going concern or sales for select assets; or, (ii) a wind-down of its business operations through a liquidation in chapter 11."* The company ceased operation soon after.

The company later asked the court to transfer the case to Chapter 7 of the code saying it had, *"no realistic chance to rehabilitate the business"* after a bankruptcy bidder (which had showed interest in buying the company's assets) withdrew.

The company's bankruptcy left the US Government with liabilities for $73.5 million in unpaid loans. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has since launched an investigation into the company's collapse.
