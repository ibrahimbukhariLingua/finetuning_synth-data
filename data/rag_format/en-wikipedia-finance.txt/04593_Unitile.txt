# Unitile



**Unitile Group of Companies** is a Russian enterprise specialising in the production and sale of facing tiles, ceramic porcelain tiles, decorative elements, and bricks. The holding company was established in 2007 on the premises of the Stroyfarfor plant, which was then a leading Russian producer of facing tiles.


## History

In the early 2000s, the Russian economy experienced rapid growth in construction volumes. According to data from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, the domestic construction industry registered an average annual growth rate of 10–14% between 2003 and 2008. During the same period, the overall Russian market for facing tiles grew by 20–25% annually. This growth was largely driven by the widespread adoption of facing tiles as a replacement for outdated technologies, such as water-based wall painting applications.

In 2007, Lazar Shaulov merged all his companies into the Unitile holding to ensure better management of assets. The holding consisted of the Stroyfarfor plant (Shakhty), a high-melting clay mine in Vladimirskaya (Rostov Oblast), the Voronezh Ceramic Factory (Voronezh), the "Quartz" plant (Saint Petersburg), and the Markin Brick Factory (village of Markin, Rostov Oblast). Upon its establishment, the group of companies controlled approximately 25% of the production of facing tiles and ceramic porcelain tiles in Russia.

According to the holding's official website, the total annual production of facing tiles and ceramic porcelain tiles by the group is approximately 26 million m² per year. The facing tiles plant in Shakhty (formerly the "Stroyfarfor" plant) remains the group's key production asset. The Shakhty plant produces around 17.6 million m², while the plant in Voronezh produces 8.4 million m² of facing tiles and ceramic porcelain tiles annually. In 2018, the total volume of the Russian market was estimated at 200 million m² by the IndexBox consulting company, while the total domestic production of facing tiles and ceramic porcelain tiles reached 172 million m².
