# Fidelity ADT



**Fidelity ADT** is a South African security company that provides fixed neighborhood security monitoring services (by means of cameras and armed patrols); subscription-based, 24-hour residential and commercial armed response; electronic security installation and maintenance; and other related security, fire, and cleaning services throughout South Africa.

Headquartered in Midrand, Gauteng, the company has been operating since 2017, when security company *Fidelity Services Group* (which had been operating for over 50 years) bought the South African operations of another security company; *ADT*, from Tyco International, for R2 billion. After the sale, the new business was named *Fidelity ADT*.


## History

Fidelity ADT was formed in 2017, through Fidelity Services Group's acquisition of Tyco International's ADT South Africa security business, following approval from South Africa's Competition Tribunal. This deal saw Fidelity Services Group absorb ADT's then-total of 365,000 clients.

In August 2024, Fidelity ADT was awarded two of consultancy PMR Africa's Golden Arrow Awards, for its effort to fight crime, and for its efforts in the security sector, over the preceding 12 months, to stimulate economic growth and development in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The Golden Arrow Award is given to businesses to represent effectiveness, excellence, leadership, and resilience, as well as to indicate customer service and satisfaction with the company.


## Operations

The company has over 5,000 trained armed response officers, and operates 40 branches, which are supported by its Specialised Services Unit; geared towards tactical interventions.

It also operates a *Community information Centre* at its offices in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape. This center maintains a membership network, and assesses statistics and feedback from community bodies, such as neighborhood watch groups.

It provides services to thousands of households and businesses across South Africa, and outside the country's borders. Their services and products include real-time, remote, 24-hour security surveillance via closed-circuit television (CCTV), access control systems, smartphone-based remote home control, license plate recognition cameras, safe home entry service (whereby an in-person armed guard will ensure clients enter their homes safely, on request), electric fencing, dedicated community control rooms and community managers, patrol vehicles, and armed guards.

Fidelity ADT provides services to over 70% of South African retailers.

Fidelity Services Group is South Africaâ€™s largest Black-owned integrated security solutions provider, with a 51% Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) shareholding, and 100% South African ownership.

The company is a registered, licensed security services provider, and complies with the regulations set forth in the *Private Security Industry Regulation Act 56 of 2001 (PSIRA)*.


## Training

All Fidelity ADT team members undergo a strict recruitment and selection process, after which they undergo at least two security clearance checks, as well as a certified psychoanalysis test, prior to being offered an opportunity to join the company. Once employed, all candidates undergo rigorous training, which is maintained throughout their time with the company.

Fidelity ADT's Armed Response Officers are all professionally trained in the usage of firearms, crime scene management, and first aid.


## VumaCam SafeCity Initiative

Fidelity ADT has partnered with South African fiber network operator Vumatel to assist with providing security services in Gauteng by using Vumatel's Vumacams to provide a live feed to the Fidelity ADT command and contro centers.

Vumacam operates over 18,000 CCTV cameras, and connects vetted security partners with the South African Police Service (SAPS), as well as with the Gauteng Provincial Government; as part of a public-private partnership (PPP). These cameras actively monitor over 7,000 public spaces across the province of Gauteng, and read, on average, around 12 million license plates per day (almost 7,000 per minute), flagging approximately 55,000 Vehicles of Interest on its Proof Platform each day.

Vumacam's purpose is to use technology to foster collaboration between the private and public sectors. It does so through its SafeCity Initiative, to serve and protect South African communities. Currently, the SafeCity Initiative is active in the cities of Ekurhuleni, Tshwane, and Johannesburg.


## Corporate social investment

In terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, among other endeavors, through its Transformation, Social, and Ethics Committee, Fidelity Services Group, has social investment initiatives in place to support education, training, sporting, and other charitable initiatives.

The company operates the *Fidelity Foundation*, whose goal is to empower communities in impoverished areas to live productive, healthy, and fulfilling lives through Fidelity Services Group's focus areas of education, health, sports, and entrepreneurship. This includes providing grants to small businesses; participating in initiatives that contribute to the reduction of crime South Africa; and creating sustainable programs that will provide permanent life skills, such as training for Early Childhood Development (ECD) teachers.
