Conseil d'Analyse Économique


# Conseil d'Analyse Économique



The **Conseil d'Analyse Économique** (**CAE**, lit. 'Council of Economic Analysis') is an economic advisory body in Paris. It is government-funded and part of the Office of the French Prime Minister. It was established by executive order of 22 July 1997 under newly elected Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, and reorganized by order of 5 November 2012 to refocus its membership criteria on academic excellence.

The CAE commissions reports from its members, which are published and serve both as advice to the government and as contributions to the public debate. It is part of a network of research bodies and institutes coordinated by (and funded through) France Stratégie.
