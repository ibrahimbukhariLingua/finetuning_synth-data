Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards


# Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards



The **Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards** (**TCSA**; Chinese: 台灣企業永續獎; pinyin: *Táiwān Qǐyè Yǒngxù Jiǎng*) is a corporate sustainability award in Taiwan. It awards outstanding Taiwanese companies and foreign companies operating in Taiwan for their contribution to sustainability. The award is hosted by the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy.

The Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy (referred to as "TAISE") strives to promote enhanced disclosure of sustainability-related information and governance practices by companies, fostering greater contributions toward sustainable development, environmental protection, and social well-being. For the past fourteen years, TAISE has organized the "Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Award" and hosted seminars focused on corporate sustainability reporting. These initiatives offer a valuable platform for domestic companies to share insights and learn from reporting practices, receiving enthusiastic participation from businesses and various societal sectors. To date, 581 companies have taken part in the awards, collectively representing an annual revenue equivalent to 167% of Taiwan’s GDP in 2021. To ensure a fair, impartial, and transparent selection process, TAISE enlisted 577 volunteer judges alongside 297 distinguished experts and scholars in 2021, forming a robust panel of 874 evaluators.
