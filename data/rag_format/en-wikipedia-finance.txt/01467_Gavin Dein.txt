## Business

The technology links consumers' credit and debit cards to offers and deals, so while making their purchases customers can receive rewards such as discounts or free gifts without showing coupons or a separate loyalty card. In 2007 the innovation was nominated for the Best Industry Innovation of the Year at that years Credit Card Awards, and in 2008 Dein was accorded the Young Gun award by *Growing Business* for his invention. In addition to this programme, Reward also administers and runs the Barclaycard football credit card. Then in 2012 Reward launched the NatWest CashbackPlus rewards programme, which provides personalised rewards for NatWest debit card holders.
