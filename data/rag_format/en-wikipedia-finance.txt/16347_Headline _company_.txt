## History

BV Capital was the successor of Bertelsmann Ventures, one of the first Internet-focused venture funds in California initiated out of Germany already in 1997. It was founded by Jan Henric Buettner, the former CEO and Wolfgang Rose, the former CTO of AOL Europe and was subsequently established in Santa Barbara, California. Buettner, acting as executive partner for Bertelsmann, had previously built up the multimedia companies CompuTel and Videotel while Rose had worked with leading software companies in Europe.

In 2000, Jan Henric Buettner, alongside Wolfgang Rose, Mathias Schilling, and Thomas Gieselmann, founded BV Capital. This new fund brought together a number of international Limited Partners, in addition to Bertelsmann. Schilling and Gieselmann had already worked with Bertelsmann Ventures and held a Bertelsmann and AOL background respectively. Andreas von Blottnitz, who had collaborated with Buettner at AOL, acted as a Venture Partner with BV Capital.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Further investments include Sonos, nCircle, Angie's List, MrTed, Peanutlabs, and Vuze.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
