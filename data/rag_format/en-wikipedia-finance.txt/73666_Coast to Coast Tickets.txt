## History

Coast to Coast's founder first began selling tickets in the late nineties while studying at the University of Missouri, a community with a strong local market for tickets , but without the size and population to attract established brokers.

In 2000, Coast to Coast Tickets was officially founded, and the name was trademarked in 2001. The business expanded over the next few years. Occupying a small home-based office before moving to an old church building, then finally converting to a larger office building in Austin, TX. Sales grew as well, grossing $2.6 million in revenue in 2004, and $8.7 million in 2005, for a 3-year growth rate of 915.4%.

In 2004, the Coast to Coast website went through a significant redesign, its goal to add an elevated level of customer service to the secondary ticket market by including concert and sports schedules, artist and team biographies, and event guides for cities and venues throughout the world. Over the same period, the size of the team was tripled, bringing in full and part-time help to provide telephone support. In 2005, the company grew again when Jason Randall (formerly of the Boston Consulting Group, Goldman Sachs and Deloitte & Touche) left his position as Director of Brand Marketing at Maritz, LLC to join Coast to Coast as CEO.

The company website adopted its current look and slogan (great tickets from nice people) in early 2006.

In 2009, Coast to Coast Tickets shifted their marketing approach from an advertising-only model to a social media marketing model, becoming active on Facebook and Twitter, and incorporating an official company blog.
