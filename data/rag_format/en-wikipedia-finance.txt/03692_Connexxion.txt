# Connexxion



**Connexxion** formerly **Transdev Netherlands**, **Veolia Transport Nederlands** and **Connex Netherlands** is a large public transport company in the Netherlands, operating in the west, middle, east, and southwest parts of the country. It is owned by Transdev and Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten. It is a subsidiary of Transdev Netherlands.


## History

Connexxion was formed on 10 May 1999 from a merger between transport companies NZH, ZWN, Midnet and Oostnet. Its name is a mutation of the French word connexion meaning connection. In January 2007, Connexxion took over Utrecht public transport operator GVU and Nijmegen operator Novio. In 2007, Connexxion's 33% shareholding in Syntus was sold.

On 12 October 2007, Connexxion was privatised with a 67% stake purchased by Transdev-BNG-Connexxion Holding BV (TBCH), a consortium consisting of Transdev (75%) and Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG) (25%), beating a Deutsche Bahn / Rabobank consortium and FirstGroup. This gives Transdev 50%, BNG 17%, and the government a 33% stake in Connexxion. In February 2013, the government's 33% shareholding was purchased by Transdev, increasing its shareholding to 86%.

Connexxion's parent company, Transdev Netherlands, also had another operation called Veolia Transport Nederland. The branding was replaced with the Connexxion in December 2016. As a result, Veolia Transport Nederland's Haaglanden operations were rebranded to Connexxion.
