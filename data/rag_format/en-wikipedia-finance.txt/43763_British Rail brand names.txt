British Rail brand names


# British Rail brand names



British Rail was the brand image of the nationalised railway owner and operator in Great Britain, the British Railways Board, used from 1965 until its breakup and sell-off from 1993 onwards.

From an initial standardised corporate image, several sub-brands emerged for marketing purposes and later in preparation for privatisation. These brands covered rail networks, customers services and several classes of new trains.

With the size of British Rail's fleet, due to the time required to repaint rolling stock, brand switchovers could be lengthy affairs, often lasting years. This worsened into privatisation, with the same services using trains using three or four different liveries.

Following privatisation, most of the brand names disappeared, although some such as ScotRail, Merseyrail, Eurostar and Freightliner still exist today.

The double-arrow symbol, which was the symbol of British Rail from 1965, still remains after privatisation as a unifying branding device used by the privatised National Rail network. It is shown on most tickets, stations, timetables, publicity and road signs indicating stations, but not trains. It is, however, set to be used more generally once again by Great British Railways.


## Timeline of brands

Under the Transport Act 1962, responsibility for the state railway operation, British Railways, was transferred from being a trade name and subsidiary of the British Transport Commission, to a separate public corporation, under the British Railways Board.

As the last steam locomotives were being withdrawn by 1968, under the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the corporation's public name was rebranded in 1965 as *British Rail*, which introduced the double-arrow symbol, a standard typeface named Rail Alphabet and the BR blue livery, which was applied to nearly all locomotives and rolling stock.

The first major BR sub-brand to appear was *InterCity*. This was augmented with the *InterCity 125* brand in 1976, in conjunction with the introduction of the InterCity 125 High Speed Train.

In the 1980s under sectorisation, blue livery was phased out as the organisation converted from a regional structure to being sector-based. The InterCity brand was relaunched and passenger brands Network SouthEast and Regional Railways introduced; these divisions introduced many sub-brands. Freight operations were split into the Trainload Freight, Railfreight Distribution and Rail Express Systems sectors.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, new multiple-unit train designs being introduced to replace rolling stock also brought new brand names; these were often linked to other branding exercises, such as the *Networker* which was built for Network SouthEast.

In the 1990s, BR created the European Passenger Services division to run passenger services through the Channel Tunnel, under the *Eurostar* brand. After construction delays, this was operated from 1994, until it passed to the London and Continental Railways consortium in 1996 as Eurostar.

In preparation for privatisation, the freight sectors were further split into smaller business functions; these were as regional splits of Trainload Freight or further splits along customer market, such as inter-modal traffic, each with their own branding. With almost all freight businesses going straight to EWS, most of these brands were short lived.
