## Products


### PX Pressure Exchanger

The PX Pressure Exchanger device is Energy Recovery's flagship product used in desalination. The Pressure Exchanger's technology utilizes pressure energy to reduce electricity and maintenance costs. The device collides two fluid flows, transferring the energy from one fluid to the next. This energy transfer occurs in a fraction of a second, reducing the interaction between the two fluids. Energy Recovery developed pressure exchanger products for specific applications, including its PX G1300™ for the CO₂ refrigeration industry, and its Ultra PX™ for Ultra High-Pressure Reverse Osmosis (UHPRO) applications in wastewater treatment.

Energy Recovery holds a majority market share in the desalination industry. There are more than 30,000 Pressure Exchangers supplied in more than 100 countries worldwide. The company's technologies have cut more than 14 billion kWh of energy each year and produced more than 12 billion liters of clean water daily.
