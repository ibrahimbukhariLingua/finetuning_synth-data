# American Savings Promotion Act



The **American Savings Promotion Act** (H.R. 3374; Pub. L. 113–251 (text) (PDF)) is a United States federal statute that authorizes some financial institutions to conduct a contest, known as a "savings promotion raffle," in which the sole consideration required for a chance of winning designated prizes is obtained by the deposit of a specified amount of money in a savings account or program, where each ticket or entry has an equal chance of being drawn. Such accounts are also known as prize-linked savings accounts.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress by Rep. Derek Kilmer (D, WA-6). A companion piece of legislation was introduced into the United States Senate by Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).

The bill passed the House on a voice vote on September 15, 2014 and passed the Senate by unanimous consent on December 10, 2014. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on December 18, 2014 and became Public Law No: 113-251.

*This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.*

The American Savings Promotion Act amended the Revised Statutes of the United States, the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the Home Owners' Loan Act to authorize federally insured banks and insured credit unions to conduct a contest, known as a "savings promotion raffle," in which the sole consideration required for a chance of winning designated prizes is obtained by the deposit of a specified amount of money in a savings account or program, where each ticket or entry has an equal chance of being drawn. Subjects such a drawing contest to regulations promulgated by the appropriate prudential regulator.

The bill excludes such a "savings promotion raffle" from the prohibition against a covered financial institution's dealing in "lottery" tickets. The bill also amends the federal criminal code to exempt savings promotion raffles conducted by a covered financial institution from specified prohibitions against interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises.
