### Mblox

**Mblox Inc.** was a global company that provided a Carrier-grade SaaS-based mobile messaging platformᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ to enterprises, including global one-way and two-way SMS, MMS, push notifications, ring-tones, shortcodes and virtual mobile numbers. Mblox Ltd. was founded in 1999, by Andrew Bud in London, England. In 2003, MBlox, Ltd. was acquired by a newly restructured and capitalized Mobilesys, Inc. Founded by David Coelho, the company assumed the name MBlox, Inc. at Andrew Bud's insistence and operated dual headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, and London, England. This transaction was spearheaded by Q-Advisors, a boutique investment bank founded by Michael Quinn in 2001 and located in Denver, Colorado. The CEO of mBlox, Inc. was William "Chip" Hoffman, who architected and executed the transaction with the help of Gary Cuccio (Chairman), and Jay Emmet (COO). The new company - Mblox Inc. – became the world leader in SMS technology use and carrier clearing and billing, growing from $1.75 million in 2002 to over $2 billion in pro forma revenue by April 2004 (19 months). This growth was primarily organic with geographic expansion into over 30 countries, including London, San Francisco, Atlanta, Stockholm, Paris, Munich, Madrid, Singapore, Manila, and Sydney.

In 2003, the company acquired carrier-grade message delivery capabilities through the purchase of an SMSC from Comverse. After stepping down in mid-2004, William "Chip" Hoffman handed the reins to then-Chairman Gary Cuccio, former Senior Executive with Pacific Telesis, and COO of the wildly successfulᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Omnipoint Wireless.

#### Public criticism and fines

Starting in 2006, with the release of the globally successful "Crazy Frog" ring-tone, MBlox became a target for regulators. Since phone bills from some carriers attribute charges to the company doing the billing, rather than to the business that actually sold and provided the service, Mblox had been accused in Internet forums of enabling a process called cramming, or automatically signing mobile customers up for unsolicited services and billing them accordingly. As of 2008, the company had been fined 22 times for cramming-related offences, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since Mblox had never had any involvement, direct or indirect, in creating or promoting such services, its responsibility was to try to prevent its customers abusing the SMS-based billing services it provided them. Following the sudden spate of problems in 2008–09, in 2010 the UK regulator Phonepay Plus commended Mblox for "a significant investment in new technology, personnel and resources to aid compliance and prevent further harm occurring to consumers from services operating over its platform." In the UK, Mblox had not been cited in any case since December 2011, at which time the regulator described its actions as "exemplary". On March 19, 2013, Mblox sold its PSMS business to OpenMarket as it chose to focus exclusively on Enterprise to Consumer mobile messaging. This brought an end to its involvement in mobile payments
