## Early career

Prior to joining Visa in November 2012, Scharf was the CEO of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for nine years from July 2004 until June 2012.

## Comments about diversity

During a September 2020 meeting held over a video call, Scharf drew both criticism and praise for comments about Black people in the workforce when he claimed that Wells Fargo faced issues reaching diversity goals because there was not enough qualified minority talent to draw from. On June 18, 2020, he had sent out a company memo, saying: “While it might sound like an excuse, the unfortunate reality is that there is a very limited pool of Black talent to recruit from.” Similar comments in the Zoom meeting reportedly angered a couple of unidentified black employees of the company. However, the same report indicated that, "Not all attendees recalled being offended. 'The meeting was incredibly constructive... I walked away being incredibly surprised at how genuine and sincere he is,' said Alex David, president of the Black/African American Connection Team Member Network." But Ken Bacon, a prominent black executive with Comcast, was "shocked and puzzled" by Scharf’s comments, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referred to Scharf’s comments on Twitter, highlighting his "lack of talent to recruit Black workers."
