## History

LLI was founded in 1867 as Leipniker Rübenzucker AG (Leipnik Beet Sugar Corporation) in Leipnik, Moravia (today Czech Republic) by the industrialists Alfred Skene and Alexander von Schoeller and consolidated with other sugar plants to Leipnik Lundenburger Zuckerfabriken AG in 1871.

After its initial public offering (IPO) at the Vienna stock exchange in 1893, the company became one of the leading companies in the Austrian monarchy’s sugar industry.

After World War II the company began to diversify, reducing its sugar production exposure, while investing in the Austrian milling industry as well as the vending industry.

In 1977–78 the sugar plants of Hohenau, Leopoldsdorf and Dürnkrut were consolidated into the newly founded SUGANA Sugar Ges.m.b.H., which towards the end of 1979 was transformed into an incorporated company, with Schoeller Holding AG as the proprietor. Schoeller Holding AG itself was taken over by the cooperative bank Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank, today Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) in 1979 and eventually in November 1989 rebranded to Agrana AG, with 11.2% of shares remaining with LLI as of today.

In 2001–02 LLI finally delisted from the stock market and expanded its activities to Central and Eastern Europe.
