## Political career

Michel Daher expressed concerns on Lebanon's economic model as early as 2012 saying "unless the government embarks on painful austerity measures, Lebanon’s economy will inch closer to the edge of a disaster" in a DailyStar interview at the time.

In 2018, Michel Daher ran for parliament on an economic reform agenda looking to decrease Lebanon's reliance on diaspora remittances and increase the country's productivity, believing the current model was not sustainable.

In May 2018, Michel Daher was elected as an independent to Lebanon's parliament in the Zahle district, one of Lebanon's most contested and competitive areas in parliamentary elections. Daher ran against political dynasties and won by a wide margin. Upon his election, Daher vowed to transfer all salaries and benefits from the state that come during his tenure to the Lebanese Army.

Daher's political positions have revolved around Lebanon's economy, warning against an impending economic collapse if the political establishment did not effect reforms. Lebanon's economy collapsed in October 2019 due to its heavy debt, corruption, reliance on remittances and the banking sector, and lack of productivity.

To mitigate the full effects of the economic collapse, in November 2019 Daher submitted a Capital Control law to parliament as well as the abolishing of Banking Secrecy laws in order to return stolen public funds, both of which were rejected by the existing political establishment.

Daher also serves as a board member of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists (ALI) and is on the Executive Committee of Higher Council for Greek Catholics in Lebanon.
