Detroit Media Partnership


# Detroit Media Partnership



**Detroit Media Partnership, L.P.** manages the business operations - including production, advertising and circulation - for the two leading Detroit newspapers: *The Detroit News* and *Detroit Free Press*. Detroit Media Partnership also handles Detroit-area circulation for *The New York Times*, *USA Today*, *Investor's Business Daily*, and *Financial Times*.

Its headquarters are in Downtown Detroit.


## History

Detroit Media Partnership is the result of a 100-year joint operating agreement between the *Detroit Free Press* and *The Detroit News*. In 1987, the newspapers entered into the agreement, combining business operations while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The two papers also began to publish joint Saturday and Sunday editions, though the editorial content of each remained separate. At the time, the *Detroit Free Press* was the 10th highest circulation paper in the United States, and the combined *Detroit News* and *Free Press* was the country's fourth-largest Sunday paper.

Originally called the Detroit Newspaper Agency, the company was reorganized and renamed after Gannett sold *The Detroit News* to MediaNews Group, and purchased the *Detroit Free Press* from Knight Ridder. Each paper now publishes separate editions Monday through Saturday, with the Detroit Free Press publishing the Sunday newspaper.

In February 2014, the Partnership announced all three units would occupy six floors in both the old and new sections of the former Detroit Branch Building of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The partnership anticipated completing the move before September and expected to place a sign on the exterior.

In 2016 the company was rebranded as Michigan.com
