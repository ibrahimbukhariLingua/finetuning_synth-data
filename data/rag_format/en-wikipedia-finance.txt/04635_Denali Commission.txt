Denali Commission


# Denali Commission



The **Denali Commission** is a federal agency in the US based in Anchorage, Alaska that provides critical utilities, infrastructure, and economic support throughout Alaska.


## History

It was established in 1998 by the Denali Commission Act of 1998 which was part of an omnibus appropriations bill. Since 2015, it has been assisting Alaskan communities whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels caused by climate change.

As of 2019, it has a budget of over $46 million.


## Governance

Modeled on the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Denali Commission is led by a Federal Co-Chair. Unlike similar commissions, the Federal Co-Chair for the Denali Commission is appointed by the Secretary of Commerce rather than by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. As a single state commission, its state co-chair is the Governor of Alaska. The remaining membership consists of the University of Alaska president; the Alaska Municipal League president; the Alaska Federation of Natives president; the Alaska State AFL-CIO president; and the Associated General Contractors of Alaska president.
