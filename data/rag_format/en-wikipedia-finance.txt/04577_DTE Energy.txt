## History


### Early 1900s

DTE's earliest direct corporate ancestor, the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit, was founded in 1886. By the turn of the century, it split responsibility for commercial electric power in the fast-growing city of Detroit with the Peninsular Electric Light Company; the latter company controlled the city's electric distribution network.

In 1903, the two companies merged as the Detroit Edison Company, which began trading on January 17. That same year, construction began on the Delray 1 Power Plant, and Henry Ford, who had left Edison Illuminating four years earlier, founded Ford Motor Company.

DTE's gas operations trace their roots to 1849, when the City of Detroit Gas Company began operation with Philadelphia engineer Lemuel Davis as its first president. The company installed Detroit's first gas lamps two years later, by which time it had changed its name to Detroit Gas Light Company. In 1903, the Detroit Gas Co. was renamed the Detroit City Gas Co. It secured franchises for Highland Park and Hamtramck and increased its customer base to more than 67,000.

In 1904, Detroit Edison signed its first power contract with an automobile company — the Cadillac Motor Car Co.

In 1905, a majority of the Detroit City Gas Co. was acquired by the American Light & Traction Co., a holding company that controlled utility and transportation interests stretching from Grand Rapids to Milwaukee.

With the added demand for electricity, the Delray 2 Power Plant was added in 1908.

In 1913, Detroit City Gas acquired additional service territory that included the communities of River Rouge, Wyandotte, Dearborn, Ecorse and Trenton.


### 1920s

Between 1924 and 1929, Detroit Edison increased its production capacity by building the Marysville, Trenton Channel and Delray 3 power plants.


### 1930s

In 1937, Detroit City Gas Company merged with Grand Rapids Gas Light Company, Washtenaw Gas Company and Ann Arbor Gas Company to form Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon). The merger, approved in 1938 by state and federal regulators, created one gas provider for most of the southern half of the Lower Peninsula.


### 1940s

To meet the increasing demand for natural gas, the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline was completed in 1945.

In 1949, Michigan Consolidated Gas, the Milwaukee Gas Co., the Michigan-Wisconsin Gas Co., the Austin Field Pipeline Co. and the Milwaukee Solvay Co. became the American Natural Gas Co.


### 1950s

Detroit Edison added the St. Clair Power Plant in 1954 — one of the largest power plants in the world at the time.

In 1956, Detroit Edison broke ground for the Enrico Fermi Power Plant and also began work on the River Rouge Power Plant.


### 1970s

This era marked another construction phase that included the start of the Fermi 2 nuclear plant in 1970 and Monroe Power Plant Units 1-4, which came online from 1971-74.

Construction also began in 1972 on the Greenwood Energy Center — the company's first inland plant designed for both oil - and nuclear-fueled generating units.

The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant, co-owned by Detroit Edison and Consumers Power Company, also went into service in 1973.

Detroit Edison was the subject of a long-running legal dispute about discrimination against black employees, led by the Association for the Betterment of Black Edison Employees. Edison agreed to pay $4.25 million in damages.


### 1980s

MichCon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Primark Corp in 1981. In 1988, Primark spun-off MichCon, and the MCN Corp. was established as the parent company of MichCon.

In 1983, Detroit Edison sought to sell its engineering expertise through the creation of Utility Technical Services, later called SYNDECO — Detroit Edison's first subsidiary business.

Supporting the new marketing push and increasing customer demand were Belle River Units 1 and 2, which went online in 1984 and 1985.

In 1986, the Detroit Edison Foundation was formed to manage the company's charitable giving programs and volunteer efforts that had grown over the years.

The Fermi 2 unit was licensed and went online in 1988. The company also founded what is now DTE Biomass Energy to begin collecting methane gas from landfills for use in energy production.


### 1990s

In January 1996, Detroit Edison reorganized as a holding company — DTE Energy. “DTE” was selected because it was the existing stock ticker symbol for Detroit Edison.


### 2000s

On May 31, 2001 DTE Energy and MCN Energy Group completed a merger which created Michigan's largest energy company and a premier regional energy provider. MichCon became an operating company of DTE Energy.

In 2007, DTE Energy began acquiring wind development rights on more than 100,000 acres of land in the Thumb area. The first DTE Energy-owned and constructed wind parks were commissioned (connected to the grid and generating power) in December 2012. Two of these wind parks are located in Huron County and one in Sanilac County.


### 2010s

In 2013, DTE Energy adopted "DTE" as its customer-facing brand. Accordingly, Detroit Edison Company changed its name to DTE Electric Company, while Michigan Consolidated Gas changed its name to DTE Gas.


### 2020s

On October 27, 2020, DTE announced its plan to spin off DTE Midstream into an independent, publicly-traded business called DT Midstream. On July 1, 2021, DT Midstream successfully spun off.

According to a statement released by the White House on Nov 18, 2021, DTE Energy participated in the American Rescue Plan by committing to help customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, by proactively using resources.

On January 16, 2025, DTE Gas and DTE Electric received a total of $8.81 billion in conditional commitments for loan guarantees through the US Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office that would be used to install thousands of megawatts of renewable energy generation and storage.
