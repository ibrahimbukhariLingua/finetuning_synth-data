Britt Cool was born and raised on a farm in Manhattan, Kansas, where, by about age 10, she operated her own produce stand.

She graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA in 2009, where, as an undergraduate, she had interned at 85 Broads, Bank of America, and Lehman Brothers. Britt Cool served as president of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business (HUWIB) and was voted "Most Likely to Become a Billionaire". She was a member of the Zeta Xi chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta. In 2006, while an undergraduate at Harvard, she co-founded Smart Woman Securities with future screenwriter Teresa Hsiao, which educates its members on investments.


## Career

Hired following her 2009 graduation, Britt Cool became the financial assistant and noted protégé of Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett.
