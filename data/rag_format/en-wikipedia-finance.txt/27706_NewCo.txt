NewCo


# NewCo



A **NewCo** or **Newco** is a term used to describe a corporate spin-off, startup, or subsidiary company before they are assigned a final name, or to proposed merged companies to distinguish the to-be-formed combined entity with an existing company involved in the merger which may have the same (or a similar) name. In a handful of cases the new company may retain the name "Newco".

The term can also be used to describe a company that was created to replace its predecessor, which ceased to exist for reasons such as financial issues: the creation of a NewCo to continue the existence of Rangers F.C. was a notable example.
