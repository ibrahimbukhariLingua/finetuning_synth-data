**Michael Bernard Easson** AM (born 22 March 1955 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia), is an Australian businessman and former trade union leader. On 8 June 1998 Easson was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM).


## Trade union work

Easson's working career began in 1978 as a research assistant to the Hon. John Brown MP. He then joined the Labor Council of New South Wales (now Unions NSW) as education and research officer, then assistant secretary (1984) and secretary (1989–1994). At the age of 34, he was elected as the youngest ever secretary. He elected vice president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, 1993 to 1994, and senior vice president of the Labor Party (NSW Branch) between 1993 and 1995. Whilst at the Labor Council he was managing director of Radio Station 2KY (1989 to 1994), and in 1989 co-founded both Asset Super (since 2012 part of CARE Super) and Chifley Financial Services. Between 1978 and 1987 Easson served as a member for the NSW council of the Trade Union Trading Authority (TUTA).

In 1994, Easson resigned as secretary of the Labor Council after a botched candidacy for the Senate vacancy left by the resigning Graham Richardson and a falling out with Labor state secretary John Della Bosca, which was followed by a failed attempt to find a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council, of which he had previously been dismissive.
