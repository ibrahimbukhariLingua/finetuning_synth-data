## History

Burgundy Diamond Mines Limited was initially known as EHR Resources Limited, an exploration company focused on a single gold and silver project, and publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX:EHX) since January 3, 2013.

On November 20, 2020, EHR Resources changed its name to Burgundy Diamond Mines to reflect the company’s transition into a developer of diamond projects with investments into the Naujaat Diamond Project in Canada’s Northwest Territories and the Botswana Exploration Alliance.

On March 24, 2021, Burgundy Diamond Mines signed an option deed with Glibb River Diamonds Ltd. (ASX:GLB) to acquire 100% ownership of the Ellendale Diamond Project and Blina projects in the West Kimberly region of Australia. The company decided not to exercise the option to acquire the Ellendale Diamond Project on March 20, 2023.

In July 2022, Burgundy launched its luxury diamond brand Maison Mazerea.

On March 14, 2023, Burgundy announced that it had entered into a share purchase agreement with the Arctic Canadian Diamond companies (Arctic Canadian Diamond Holding LLC to acquire 100 percent of the issued capital in Arctic Canadian Diamond Company Ltd. and Arctic Canadian Diamond Marketing N.V.). The transaction closed in July 2023, making Burgundy Diamond Mines a fully-integrated, global-scale company that has the ability to trace the full chain of custody of high-quality sourced diamonds from Ekati Diamond Mine in Canada directly to its customers.

In September 2024, Burgundy paused its plans to develop an underground project at one of the Ekati diamond mine's pits. Also in September the company called for reduced regulations in the region. Some of their requests to the NWT include lowering the amount of money the mine must set aside for reclamation costs and a guarantee that Ekati's impact benefit agreements will be grandfathered in when the Mineral Resources Act is revised, which would help Burgundy avoid any new requirements to pay Indigenous groups impacted by the mine.
