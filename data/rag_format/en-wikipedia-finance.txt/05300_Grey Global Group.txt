## Notable work


### *Leave the Driving to Us* (Greyhound)

In 1956, Grey co-founder Arthur C. Fatt wrote the longstanding Greyhound Lines catchphrase "Leave the driving to us."


### Villarriba and Villabajo

In 1991, Grey Spain conceived for Procter & Gamble an advertising campaign for its Fairy dishwashing liquid for the Spanish market focused on a television commercial in which two fictional towns, Villarriba and Villabajo, compete for the best paella at their popular fiestas. The commercial was soon dubbed into other languages and used in markets such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Portugal and Greece, modifying the detergent bottle with the corresponding local one. The advertising campaign has been renewed many times over the years, it was expanded to other products of the brand and it has even had local versions in other countries. In 2016, Procter & Gamble –which is one of the largest advertisers in Spain– chose Villarriba and Villabajo as their best advertising campaign ever in the country given its popularity and excellent brand positioning results.


### *Let the Issues Be the Issue*

During the final weeks of the 2008 United States presidential election, the firm debuted a self-funded political ad depicting candidates Barack Obama and John McCain with inverted skin tones and the text "LET THE ISSUES BE THE ISSUE." The campaign was rolled-out both digitally and via newspaper ads and posters hung around New York City. According to creative director Tor Myhren, it was "a non-partisan image. We wanted to address the race issue straight on. And it cuts both ways; if you're hopping on either candidate's bandwagon solely due to the color of their skin, you're voting for the wrong reasons."


### *Time Sculpture*

In November 2008, the firm began working with Toshiba to advertise its high-definition television upscaling technology. Its first ad, *Time Sculpture*, was a British television and cinema advertisement which comprised a collection of interacting movement loops sequenced into a single shot. The commercial was based on a video art proposal by director Mitch Stratten. *Time Sculpture* holds the world record for the greatest number of moving image cameras used in a single shot.


### *Space Chair*

In 2009, the firm's London office developed a world record-setting campaign for Toshiba titled *Space Chair*. The minute-long ad featured the launch of an armchair into near space attached to a weather balloon at an altitude of 29,952 metres (98,268 ft)—making it the highest-altitude television commercial that had ever been filmed.


## Awards

In 2010, Grey was listed on *Fast Company*'s "50 Most Innovative Companies". In 2010, it was added to *Advertising Age*'s "Agency A-List". In 2006, Grey was awarded 12 "Spots of the Week" by *Ad Age*, which placed it second highest overall.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Controversy

In 2016, Grey for Good, Grey Group's philanthropic communications division, created a hoax app that claimed to use crowdsourcing to help the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean Sea. After it was debunked by developers, the Apple Store pulled the app on the same day it was awarded a Bronze Lion at the Cannes Lions festival.
