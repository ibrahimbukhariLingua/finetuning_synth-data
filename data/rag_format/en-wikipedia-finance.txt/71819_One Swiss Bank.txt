## The Hentsch Family

One Swiss Bank was founded in 2004 by Bénédict Hentsch among others, who represents the seventh generation in a dynasty of one of Europe's most prominent banking families.

The Genevoise line of the Hentsch family emigrated to Switzerland in the 18th century from the Protestant and Culturally German part of Poland. The line can trace itself directly back to the stockbrocker and financier Henri Hentsch.

In 1789, the finance trade in Geneva was heavily influenced by the onslaught of the French Revolution. In 1793, Henri Hentsch was detained by Genevan revolutionaries and exiled to Nyon, where he began a silk trading business with an associate, Edmé Mémo.

Despite experiencing profound economic difficulties and high unemployment, Henri Hentsch came back to Geneva to found H. Hentsch & Cie in 1796. The firm, known as a house of "Silk and Sales", traded silk in parallel with its banking activities. This would set the precedent for the founding of Lombard Odier & Co.

Henri Hentsch handled bills of exchange and letters of credit for foreigners. Some of his illustrious clients included Napoleon I and even Madame de Staël, daughter of Jacques Necker, the minister of Finance to Louis XVI.

In 1826, he founded a second establishment in Paris, leaving his son the company in Geneva.
