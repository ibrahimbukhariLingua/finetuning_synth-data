**Wesley R. Gray** is an American author, veteran and a former assistant professor of finance. He is best known for his book, *EMBEDDED: A Marine Corps Adviser Inside the Iraqi Army*, an account of his eight-month military assignment in Iraq.


## Early life

Raised on a cattle ranch in Colorado and having spent part of his youth in Northern California, Gray graduated magna cum laude from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics in 2002. After graduating, he enrolled at the University of Chicago.


## Military service

In 2004, Gray took a four-year sabbatical from his studies to serve as an intelligence officer in the United States Marine Corps. He spent his first two years as an intelligence officer in Asia. In 2006, Marine lieutenant Gray served on a Military Transition Team in Haditha, Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. There he served as an embedded officer providing advice, mentoring and support to the Iraqi in place of U.S. Special Forces who were spread too thin to perform the task. Following his service, he became a captain in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.


## Post-military career

Gray wrote *EMBEDDED: A Marine Corps Adviser Inside the Iraqi Army*, which was released in April 2009 and published by the U.S. Naval Institute Press. The 240-page book came from 1000 pages of personal notes that he logged during his eight-month military assignment in Iraq to share with his wife and daughter. Graeme Sligo, reviewing the book for the *Australian Army Journal*, concluded that it "is a well-written description of what it was like to be an adviser to an Iraqi Army file unit in Anbar Province." After his service he obtained both a M.B.A. and a Ph.D. in finance from the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business in 2010.

In 2010, Gray founded an investment startup with Carl Kanner and initially managed money for a billionaire family.
