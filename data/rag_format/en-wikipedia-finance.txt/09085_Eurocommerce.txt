Eurocommerce


# Eurocommerce



**EuroCommerce** is the principal European organisation representing the retail and wholesale sector. It is led by the Director General.

It gathers members in about 27 countries: representing mostly SMEs and some large companies and federations of companies at a European or national level.

EuroCommerce represents one in seven jobs (up to 26 million employees) in Europe. It supports millions of further jobs throughout the supply chain, from small local suppliers to international businesses.

EuroCommerce is the recognised European social partner for the retail and wholesale sector.


## History

EuroCommerce was founded in 1993, as a result of merging three pre-existing large retail chains, small retail operators and wholesalers and traders. It brings together European and national associations representing various aspects of retail and wholesale and international trade to form a single voice for the sector in Brussels.

Its first president (from 1993 to 1994) and driving force behind the creation of EuroCommerce, was Dr Albert Heijn (1927–2011), the chairman of the major Dutch retailer Ahold.


## Policy areas

EuroCommerce brings together the expertise of its members and secretariat to help inform and contribute to debate in a range of policies, including competitiveness and the economy, the digital economy, single market, global trade, environment and sustainability, social policy and industrial relations, food and non-food, enterprise and SMEs.
