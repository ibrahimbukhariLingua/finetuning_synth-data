Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Book Awards


# Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Book Awards



The **Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Book Awards**, formerly known as the **Scottish Arts Council Book Awards,** Scottish Arts Council Creative Scotland Award (2001), and Sundial Scottish Arts Council Book Awards (2007-2008), were a series of annual literary awards in Scotland that ran from 1972 to 2013. Organised by Creative Scotland (formerly the Scottish Arts Council/SAC), it was sponsored by the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (2013), Sundial Properties (at least 2007-2008).

Starting in 2007, the Scottish Arts Council Book Awards have recognised and rewarded Scottish authors in four categories: Fiction (including the short story), Poetry, Nonfiction and First Book. The winners in each category were selected by a panel of judges, and a public vote decided the overall winner of the Book of the Year award. The selected authors either live in Scotland or wrote a book that is of Scottish interest.

In 1999 a new overall prize of £10,000 for the Book of the Year. In 2013 the category winners received £5,000 each, with the Book of the Year winner receiving a further £25,000.
