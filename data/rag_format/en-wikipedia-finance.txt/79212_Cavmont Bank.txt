## History

The Bank was established on 1 January 2004, following a merger between Cavmont Merchant Bank Limited (incorporated in October 1992), and New Capital Bank Plc., (incorporated in June 1992). In 2006 the Bank's holding company, *Cavmont Capital Holdings Zambia Plc (CCHZ)'*, sought a strategic investment partner and identified *Capricorn Investment Holdings Limited (CIH)*. CIH acquired a 44.2% shareholding in CCHZ in 2007.

Discussions held with the Bank of Zambia to find an acceptable manner to recapitalize Cavmont Bank through a rights issue by CCHZ were concluded successfully, with CIH underwriting the rights issue. Consequently, CCHZ raised additional share capital of more than K15.4 billion in 2007 and the re-positioning of Cavmont Bank commenced.

The Bank of Zambia revised capitalization requirements for local Banks and foreign Banks and it is in light of this that the holding company has warehoused 51% shares in Makumbi Investments Limited a special purpose vehicle earmarked for forward offer to local investors. As of 31 December 2013, the Bank has met the equity shareholding and capital requirements for local banks.
