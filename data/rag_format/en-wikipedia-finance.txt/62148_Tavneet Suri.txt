## Research

Suri's research primarily focuses on the uptake and diffusion of new technologies in the developing world. She has devoted particular attention to the take-up of innovations in agriculture and mobile payments.


### Mobile Money

Suri has also directed her attention towards mobile money, studying disparities in Kenyan households' access to M-Pesa agents to study the impact of the scheme on risk management, poverty, and consumption. They find that mobile money facilitates risk sharing, with remittances more easily transferred between household members. In total, they estimate that the rollout of the scheme lifted 194,000 Kenyan households out of poverty, a 2% reduction.
