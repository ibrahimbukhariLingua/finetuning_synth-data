**OPmobility** is a French automotive supplier. OPmobility operated under the name **Plastic Omnium** until March 27, 2024.


## History

Plastic Omnium was founded by Pierre Burelle in 1946. It began making plastic steering columns for Renault, but soon extended its supply contracts to other carmakers in France and abroad. In 1995, it made a tender offer for its most important rival in the French industry, Reydel, and then acquired it from its major stakeholder Compagnie Financière de Turenne. According to their website, Plastic Omnium currently has 131 plants and is present in 26 countries.


## Divisions


### Plastic Omnium Automobile

Two automotive divisions, Auto Exterior Division and Auto Inergy Division (previously: Inergy Automotive Systems). The first provides external plastic elements (thermoplastic and composite) for cars, like bumpers and energy absorption systems, fender and front-end modules. The second provides plastic fuel tank systems and SCR tank systems. In 2011, Inergy purchased the Ford Motor Company's fuel tank manufacturer in United States, Visteon, and became its sixth largest world provider. The company has plans to introduce more composite materials to reduce the weight of their pieces and gain market advantage.
