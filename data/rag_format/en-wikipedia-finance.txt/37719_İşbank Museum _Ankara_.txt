## Building

The five-stories-high building was built in 1929 as the headquarters of Türkiye İş Bankası (*İşbank* for short). Its architect was Giulio Mongeri. Later, it was also used as the Ankara Ulus Heykel branch office of the bank. However, the area around Ulus square was planned as a cultural center of Ankara with such museums as the Republic Museum and the War of Independence Museum. The executive board of the bank decided to convert the building into a museum as a part of the cultural center.
