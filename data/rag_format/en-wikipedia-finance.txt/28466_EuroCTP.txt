# EuroCTP



**EuroCTP** (**European Consolidated Tape Provider**)
**B.V.** is a joint venture of 14 bourses, intending to tender for the provision of a consolidated tape (CT) for financial trading in the European Union (EU). The selection process, arranged by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), is scheduled to be finalised in 2025. This forms part of the European Commission's Capital Markets Union.

For comparison, a similar electronic service, the Consolidated Tape System, has been in place in the United States since 1976. Following Brexit, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has tabled a CT reform similar to the EU's.


## History


### Background

In the EU, financial markets are highly fragmented, with trading occurring across multiple exchanges and alternative trading venues. This makes it difficult for investors to get a clear picture of market activity, particularly in real-time. The EU has been lagging behind the U.S. in this regard, where consolidated tapes have been available for equities since the 1970s.

Bourses had initially signaled reluctance towards the Commission's CT plans.


### 2023-present: Inception

On 16 February 2023, EuroCTP was announced.

On 23 August 2023, EuroCTP was incorporated, and the chair of its supervisory board, Jorge Yzaguirre Scharfhausen, was announced.

On 5 December 2023, the leadership of EuroCTP was announced.

ESMA tender competitors include:

* Jointly: Bloomberg, MarketAxess and Tradeweb. They pulled out of the competition in December 2023.
