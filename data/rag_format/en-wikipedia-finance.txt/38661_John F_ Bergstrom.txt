## Philanthropy

Bergstrom has served on the boards of Associated Bank, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, WEC Energy Group, the Green Bay Packers, and the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center.

He was a member of the Marquette University Board of Trustees in the late 1990s, where he supported the School of Dentistry's initiative to construct a new facility and revise its curriculum. His involvement included advocating for state funding and operational changes to improve the school's financial stability. He received several awards from Marquette University, including the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year Award in 1988 and the All-University Alumnus of the Year Award in 2003.

Bergstrom participated in philanthropic efforts in the Fox Valley. He contributed to projects such as the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center and an outdoor skating rink in downtown Neenah.

He led a project to create an ice rink in downtown Neenah, which was modeled after Rockefeller Center's rink.

His company supported the establishment of a new Boys & Girls Club in the Fox Cities area, which resulted in him receiving the Janet Berry Volunteer of the Year Award in 2015.
