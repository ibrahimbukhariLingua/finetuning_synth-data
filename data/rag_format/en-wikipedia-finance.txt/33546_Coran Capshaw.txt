# Coran Capshaw



**Coran Capshaw** is an American music industry executive, entrepreneur and founder of Red Light Management, a company that represents recording artists.

He is the manager of Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Chris Stapleton and The Strokes among others. He is also a concert promoter, independent record label owner, merchandiser and real estate developer.

Capshaw's career in the music industry began in 1991 when he was the owner of Trax, a venue where he gave Dave Matthews Band their first weekly gig. Seeing the success of the band locally, Capshaw began managing the band out of Trax and helped grow them from playing in nightclubs to amphitheaters and stadiums.


## Red Light Management

Capshaw founded Red Light Management in 1991 while managing Dave Matthews Band in Charlottesville, Virginia. The company is a talent management company and represents over 400 artists including Lionel Richie, Lainey Wilson, Enrique Iglesias, Brandi Carlile and Luke Bryan.

As of 2022, the company had over 70 managers and hundreds of support staff, with offices in Nashville, London, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York and Charlottesville. According to music industry trade magazine Pollstar, acts managed by Red Light Management generate $500 million in ticket sales annually.


## Musictoday

In 2000, Capshaw founded e-commerce company Musictoday to generate direct-to-fan e-commerce tools for the artists he managed to sell their merchandise, tickets, and other fan-related products directly to their audiences, bypassing traditional retail channels. By 2005 the company's roster had more than 500 clients and gross sales exceeding $100 million.

In 2006 Live Nation Entertainment acquired a minority stake in the company and eventually purchased the company outright.

In 2014, after making Musictoday’s ticket-sales operation, Ticketstoday, a division of its Ticketmaster division, Live Nation sold the remainder of the company to Delivery Agent, an interactive-commerce company that specialized in digital transaction platforms for TV networks and sports partners. Delivery Agent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2016.

In 2017, Capshaw reacquired Musictoday. As of 2017 the company employed approximately 140 people.
