## Legal difficulties


### United States allegation

On May 22, 2012, the United States Department of the Treasury announced the identification of Belarus-based JSC CredexBank (Credex) as a financial institution of primary money laundering concern under the USA PATRIOT Act (Section 311). The U.S. Government took this action because it has reason to believe that Credex has engaged in high volumes of transactions that are indicative of money laundering on behalf of shell corporations, and has a history of ownership by shell corporations whose own lack of transparency contributes to considerable uncertainty surrounding Credex's true beneficial ownership.


### Credexbank response

On May 25, 2012, Credexbank JSC issued a press release "that assertions of the United States Department of the Treasury regarding transactions carried out by the Bank and the possibility itself for a small Belarusian bank to act as a “key center for money laundering” are groundless."
Credexbank reports that "An audit for the observance of measures by the Bank aimed at combating money laundering and financing of terrorism has been also carried out by the respective state authorities" such as the State Control Committee of the Republic of Belarus and the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus. Credexbank JSC announced that it is " consulting with their lawyers in Switzerland in order to protect business reputation" and "to prove the noninvolvement of Credexbank JSC in illegal business and eliminate any doubts about reliability of the bank".
