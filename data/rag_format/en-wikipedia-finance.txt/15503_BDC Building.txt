The **BDC Building**, 22-storey office tower (91.5 m), is the 6th tallest building in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Originally the building was known as the *IBM Building* when it first opened in 1972. The "*BDC*" stands for the Business Development Bank of Canada. It stands on the corners of Main Street West and MacNab Street South.


## History and design

Plans for the building were announced on 5 August 1969, and the sod was turned that same week. The building was constructed by Cutaia Investments Limited, a development firm founded and operated by brothers Angelo (1929–1981), Nicholas (1928–2016), and Richard Cutaia (1922–2000). The brothers constructed their first building, the Professional Arts Building, in 1959 at 155 James Street South on the site of their father's grocery store. The expected completion date was late 1970, however, this would end up being put back. Other projects by the Cutaias included Alexandra Square and the Undermount Building.

On 5 November 1970, Mayor Victor Copps led the topping off ceremony. Following the ceremony, a formal reception was held on the building's seventh floor, where civic officials and guests had champagne and caviar. On Friday, 26 March 1971, IBM began moving into the building, and opened its office the following Monday.
