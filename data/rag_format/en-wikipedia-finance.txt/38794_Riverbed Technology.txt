### Zeus Technology

In connection with Riverbed's July 2011 acquisition of the outstanding securities of Zeus Technology Limited, the share purchase agreement provided for certain additional potential payments (acquisition-related contingent consideration) totaling up to $27.0 million in cash, based on achievement of certain bookings targets related to Zeus products for the period from July 20, 2011, through July 31, 2012 (the Zeus earn-out period).
