Deloitte sponsors Ai Group's premier annual event the National Forum and Annual National Dinner. The group maintains influences in a variety of public policy areas, weighing in on such issues as the response to the Fair Work Act 2009, minimum wage, skill shortages, environment and energy, occupational health and safety, trade, and defence. Ai Group provides information, advice and assistance to help members. Through policy leadership and research-based advocacy members are represented at all levels of government by representing and promoting their interests on current and emerging issues.

Ai Group members operate small, medium and large businesses. They include many major Australian and global companies operating in a range of industries. The Group itself employs more than 300 people and 550 apprentices and trainees through its training arm, Australian Industry Group Training Services.
