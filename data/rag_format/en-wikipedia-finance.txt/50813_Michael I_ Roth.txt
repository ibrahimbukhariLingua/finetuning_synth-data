### MONY

In 1988, Roth joined the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York as their chief financial officer. In 1990, he was named president and chief operating officer succeeding James B. Farley, who continued as chairman and chief executive. In September 2003, AXA Financial, Inc. announced a takeover offer of $1.5 billion for MONY Group of New York, which Roth supported but some of its largest shareholder's, including Highfields Capital Management, Third Avenue Management, Southeastern Asset Management and Advisory Research, immediately objected to as being too low. The offer was accepted by shareholders in May 2004, and on July 8, 2004, MONY became a wholly owned subsidiaries of European insurer, allowing AXA to become "the fourth-largest seller of variable annuities in the United States and the largest seller of variable life insurance."

As part of the takeover, Roth stood "to receive as much as $23.3 million, including payments for vested stock options". Additionally, Mony's president and CEO, Samuel J. Foti (who joined the company in 1988 from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company), may get as much as $16.4 million; the chief investment officer, Kenneth M.

### Interpublic

In January 2005, Roth became chief executive officer and co-chairman of the Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG) in New York, succeeding David A. Bell. Roth had previously joined the Interpubic board in February 2002. Notably, "Interpublic had to restate earnings downward by $181.3 million, because of accounting irregularities that first emerged in August 2002." Upon Bell's retirement in 2006, he became sole chairman. In October 2020, IPG announced that Phillippe Krakowsky would be succeeding Roth as the company's CEO on January 1, 2021. Roth retired from the company and the Board of Directors on December 31, 2021.
