## Background

The company is based in Ternitz, south-west of Vienna. As of October 2015, it is a member of the Austrian Traded Index, the index of the twenty largest companies traded on the Vienna stock exchange.

## Criticism

Schoeller-Bleckmann has faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia despite the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. This decision has drawn attention due to international sanctions imposed on Russia and widespread condemnation of the war, which has resulted in significant civilian casualties and destruction in Ukraine. Critics argue that the company's presence in Russia undermines global efforts to isolate the aggressor state economically and diplomatically.
