## Corporate history


### Foundation

GrapeCity, formerly Bunka Orient Corporation, was founded in Miyagi prefecture, Japan in 1980 by Paul Broman. The company was established to provide software solutions for the emerging personal computer market in Japan.

Paul Broman worked with Daniel Fanger, now Chairman of GrapeCity and Principal of MeySen Academy, and Nobuo Iwasa to turn Bunka Orient Corporation into a software development company.


### Original products


#### LeySer School Management Software

The company's first software product was LeySer Services for school management, which Paul Broman used to help run the MeySen Academy and KeiMei Elementary School, which he founded in the 1970s. Having sent some of his teachers to learn programming, he then directed them in creating software to support the accounting and reporting needs of his schools. Later, they sold the software to other schools through what was still known as Bunka Orient Corporation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


#### Localization of Developer Tools

The company expanded into a range of other software products and services, beginning by localizing developer tools for the Japanese market, another empty niche they discovered when developing LeySer Services. Beginning in 1993, they grouped these localized tools together and resold them as their Power Tools line.

Localized tools included:

* PowerTCP Tools (1999)
* JClass (2002) and JProbe (2007) Java(TM) Components
* LEADTOOLS Imaging Toolkits
* FarPoint Spread (1999)

### Name change

Originally named Bunka Orient Corporation when it was founded in 1980, the company found that its name was often confused with other entities with the same acronym when it expanded into China and India. The company was renamed GrapeCity in 2002.

In 2005, when GrapeCity established a media design and digital production facility, they established WINEstudios.


### Acquisitions

One of the developer tools that GrapeCity localized for Japanese programmers was ActiveReports from Data Dynamics. In addition to localizing the user interface and documentation, GrapeCity performed quality testing for Japanese usage of the product and requested new features. After a long association with the company, in October, 2008, GrapeCity announced their acquisition of Data Dynamics, in Columbus, Ohio.

Another of the developer tools that GrapeCity localized was Spread from FarPoint Technologies. In a similar move, after long association with the company, they announced their acquisition of FarPoint Technologies in Morrisville, North Carolina, September, 2009.

In 2012, GrapeCity also completed the acquisition of ComponentOne in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which includes the developer tools ComponentOne Studio, a .NET tookit for Visual Studio; Wijmo, a set of controls for JavaScript and HTML5, including AngularJS and KnockoutJS; and Xuni, a native mobile control collection for Xamarin.Forms, iOS, WindowsPhone, and Android.
