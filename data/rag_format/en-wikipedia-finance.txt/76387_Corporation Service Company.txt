## History

Corporation Service Company (CSC) was founded in 1899 by Otho Nowland, then president of Equitable Guarantee & Trust Company, and Christopher L. Ward. With an initial investment by Nowland, Ward, and another friend, Willard Jackson, The Delaware Incorporators’ Trust Company was created. A similar company was formed separately by Josiah P. Marvel, an attorney and then-leader of the American Bar Association, The Delaware Bar Association, and the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce.

In 1920, Ward and Marvel combined their two companies under the name Corporation Service Company. Throughout the 1970s, CSC continued to serve only Delaware business entities. WMB Holdings is the parent company of CSC.

CSC's Corporate Domains business provides services to Apple, Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Twitter, Starbucks, Lego, Sony Group Corporation, The Walt Disney Company, Ford Motor Company, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Toyota Motor Corporation, Vodafone Group Plc, among others.

CSC received a cash infusion from the sale of its subsidiary company, the Delaware Charter Guarantee & Trust Company, which it had acquired in 1977. During the September 11 attacks, the company had offices on the 87th floor of the World Trade Center's South Tower. All 60 employees present at the time of the attacks managed to evacuate the tower before the second plane struck. In 2017, CSC opened its new headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware and rebranded from "Corporation Service Company" to "CSC."
