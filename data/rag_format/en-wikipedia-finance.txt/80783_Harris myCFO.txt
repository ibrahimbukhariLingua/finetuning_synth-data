## Criticism

In 2002 myCFO was implicated in a federal investigation involving questionable tax shelters. In July 2005, the American Arbitration Association ruled against myCFO and its partners for its involvement. On February 13, 2008, a federal trial court delivered a criminal conviction on Graham Taylor, a tax attorney associated with myCFO; Taylor had pleaded guilty on January 24, 2008, to conspiracy and aiding in the filing of a false tax return. Taylor used to be with the LeBoeuf law firm, which was used by myCFO selling tax shelter products. The tax accountants and attorneys, including Taylor, convicted in 2008, had been indicted in November 2005 for conspiring to defraud the United States and to commit mail and wire fraud, including tax evasion and assisting in the filing of false tax returns.
