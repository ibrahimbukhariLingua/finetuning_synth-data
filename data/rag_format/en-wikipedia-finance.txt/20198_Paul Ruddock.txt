Ruddock was knighted in the 2012 New Year's Honours List for services to the arts and philanthropy. At the time of the award, some commentators called for the New Years Honours List to be made more transparent, particularly where, as in the case of Ruddock, recipients are political party donors.

Ruddock himself provided written testimony on the subject to a House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee, in which he advocated that the honours system explain the basis for each individual award. Ruddock was one of 33,000 individuals to invest in film partnerships that were later contested successfully by HMRC.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
