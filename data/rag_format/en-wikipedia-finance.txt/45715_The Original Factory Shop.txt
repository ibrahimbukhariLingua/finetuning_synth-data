# The Original Factory Shop



**The Original Factory Shop** is a discount department store chain that was established in 1969. It currently operates almost two hundred stores across the United Kingdom.


## History

The Original Factory Shop was established in 1969 as part of Peter Black's retail network. Initially it sold soap manufactured by one of Black's factories. The chain now has 185 outlets.

During 2010 to 2011, the chain expanded its warehouse and offices in Burnley by 100,000 square feet (9,300 m²) to provide for the future needs of the business.

In August 2011, the chain did not perform as well with profits reduced, due to economic conditions and massive investment in the chain, including many store openings, expansion of headquarters and warehouse and upgrading store equipment. The chief executive of The Original Factory Shop is former Lloyds Pharmacy boss Tony Page, who replaced Angela Spindler in June 2013. In May 2010, rumours surfaced that the parent company Duke Street Capital put the chain up for sale for £200 million. These rumours were later denied by The Original Factory Shop and Duke Street Capital.

On 26 June 2018, it was announced that The Original Factory Shop is to close 32 stores due to falling profits, and the withdrawal of its credit insurance. The Original Factory Shop has also reported that it will be unsurprisingly starting a company voluntary arrangement process.

The group's profits soared, post the COVID-19 pandemic, in the financial year 2021/22. Total revenue throughout the organization was £124.4 million, a growth of 250%. Actual profit being recorded at £8.5 million, up £2.4 million on the previous year.

In 2024, Ian Williams was appointed as CEO.
