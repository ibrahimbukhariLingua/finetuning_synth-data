The **Lacy Baronetcy**, of Ampton in the County of Suffolk, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created 23 June 1921 (as part of the 1921 Birthday Honours) for Pierce Lacy, Chairman of the Birmingham Stock Exchange and founder of the British Trusts Association and the British Shareholders Trust.

The first baronet was born in Birmingham but his father John Pierce Lacy, was born in Enniscorthy, County Wexford and moved to Edgbaston, Warwickshire. The first baronet married Ethel Maud Draper, daughter of artist James Finucane Draper of Saint Helier, Jersey. Since 1998, the baronetcy has been held by Sir Patrick Brian Finucane Lacy, 4th Baronet, who inherited the title after his elder brother, the third baronet, died without children.
