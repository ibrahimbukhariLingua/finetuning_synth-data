Peruvian sol


# Peruvian sol



The **sol** (Spanish pronunciation: [sol]; plural: **soles**; currency sign: **S/**) is the currency of Peru; it is subdivided into 100 *céntimos* ("cents"). The ISO 4217 currency code is **PEN**.

The sol replaced the Peruvian inti in 1991 and the name is a return to that of Peru's historic currency, as the previous incarnation of sol was in use from 1863 to 1985. Although *sol* in this usage is derived from the Latin *solidus* (lit. 'solid'), the word also means "sun" in Spanish. There is thus a continuity with the old Peruvian inti, which was named after Inti, the Sun God of the Incas.

At its introduction in 1991, the currency was officially called *nuevo sol* ("new sol"), but on November 13, 2015, the Peruvian Congress voted to rename the currency simply *sol*.


## History

Currencies in use before the current Peruvian sol include:

* The *Spanish colonial real* from the 16th to 19th centuries, with 8 reales equal to 1 peso.
* The *Peruvian real* from 1822 to 1863. Initially worth 1⁄8 peso, *reales* worth 1⁄10 peso were introduced in 1858 in their transition to a decimal currency system.
* The *sol* or *sol de oro* from 1863 to 1985, at 1 sol = 10 reales.
* The *inti* from 1985 to 1991, at 1 inti = 1,000 *soles de oro*.

Due to the bad state of economy and hyperinflation in the late 1980s, the government was forced to abandon the inti and introduce the sol as the country's new currency. The new currency was put into use on July 1, 1991, by Law No. 25,295, to replace the inti at a rate of 1 sol to 1,000,000 intis, or one *inti millón*. Coins denominated in the new unit were introduced on October 1, 1991, and the first banknotes on November 13, 1991. Since that time,ʷʰᵉⁿ? the sol has retained an inflation rate of 1.5%, the lowest ever in either South America or Latin America as a whole.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ Since the new currency was put into effect, it has managed to maintain an exchange rate between S/2.2 and S/4.13 per US dollar.


## Coins

Coins were introduced in 1991 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 *céntimos* and S/1. Coins for S/2 and S/5 were added in 1994. The one- and five-*céntimo* coins fell out of use and the one-*céntimo* was removed from circulation on May 1, 2011 followed by the five-*céntimos* on January 1, 2019. (For cash transactions retailers must round down to the nearest ten *céntimos* or up to the nearest five. Electronic transactions continue to be processed at the exact amount.)

All coins show the coat of arms of Peru surrounded by the text *Banco Central de Reserva del Perú* ("Central Reserve Bank of Peru") on the obverse; the reverse of each coin shows its denomination. Included in the designs of the bimetallic S/2 and S/5 coins are the hummingbird and condor figures from the Nazca Lines.

## Banknotes

Banknotes for S/10, S/20, S/50, and S/100 were introduced in 1990. The banknote for S/200 was introduced in August 1995. All notes are of the same size (140 x 65 mm) and contain the portrait of a well-known historic Peruvian on the obverse.

A new series of banknotes was issued starting in 2021, beginning with the S/10 and S/100 notes in July 2021 and followed by the S/20 and S/50 notes in July 2022. A S/200 note was released in December 2023.
