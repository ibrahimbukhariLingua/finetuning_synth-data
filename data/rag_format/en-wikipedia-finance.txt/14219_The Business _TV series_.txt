| Making the most of the box office success generated by their indie-thriller House of Fear, the team at Vic's Flicks moves up the ladder and into new offices. Interior design face-offs aside, Julia's main goal is to apply her carefully crafted 5-year business plan and find a follow-up hit. But will the rest of them comply?

| From the moment French director Kiki de Charentais (Simone-Elise Girard) makes her first appearance, she exudes a lingering sexual energy, powerful enough to corrupt the purest of souls. Indeed, something has come over the team at Vic's Flicks: buttons are undone, hair is flipped, body parts are exposed, soldiers are erect, fantasy flirts with reality and the magnetism in the air is practically palpable. Will the imprint left by Kiki's alluring presence be permanent? | | | | | |
| 03 | "Lance-A-Lot" | TBA | TBA | August 19, 2007 (2007-08-19) | 203 |
| After a masterful story-telling Irishman makes his brilliant film pitch about an IRA bomber on a politically motivated hunger strike, the team at Vic's Flicks lets the weight of it all set the tone for the remainder of the day.

But Lance rolls in having undergone sizeable changes, leaving the others flabbergasted and speechless. | | | | | |

| People's pasts are back to haunt them. A handsome prowling stranger turns out to be Julia's ex-husband and threatens Vic's Flicks publicist Tony's confidence with his good looks, his charm and his firm grip. Vic must attempt to dodge a legal bullet when his past as a cheap smut-peddler revisits him. And Derek Tibble, a seemingly innocent friend from House of Fear director Rufus' past, threatens Rufus' credibility and the legitimacy of his work. | | | | | |

| Fear overcomes Vic when he realizes a deep-seated family secret is back to haunt him and forces (or paranoia?) are out to get him. No one is to be trusted: the elevator repairman is making clear attempts on his life; Terrence is conspiring against him with his not-so-trustworthy business partner; intern-turned-spy Nancy Drake serves Tony in his quest to find out the real reason behind Julia and Terrence's secretive behaviour. All because of a suspicious roll of film that proves one of the greatest cover-ups in modern history. | | | | | |
| 06 | "The Family Jules" | TBA | TBA | September 9, 2007 (2007-09-09) | 206 |
| Discouraged that she has neither found an idea for their next big hit nor acquired an Independent Spirit Award nomination for House of Fear, Julia chooses to change her focus. Blinded by her discontent, she fails to notice that the golden script she's been hoping for is right under her nose, in her intern Nancy's hands. As Nancy's frustration grows when everyone dismisses her attempts at being heard, she resorts to malicious measures to punish Vic's Flicks for not paying better attention to her real potential. In the end, it's all about karma. | | | | | |

Enthralled by the idea of pursuing endless opportunities, they all go out to chase their dreams. But their high hopes are quickly hampered by a slew of characters that only Hollywood could provide. Will the team manage to keep their integrity intact or will they let themselves be corrupted by the West Coast air? | | | | | |

| Dressed to the nines, the gang makes their way to the red carpet, some as concerned about their speech as Rufus is about his bowel movements. While Lance and Tony feel completely at home schmoozing, Julia is like a deer in headlights. Nevertheless, they all make it inside to await the outcome of the long-anticipated awards ceremony. Despite Lance's tasteless ways, Vic's foot lodged permanently in his mouth, Julia's nervous blathering, and Rufus' unfortunate intolerance to spicy foods, the Vic's Flicks team proves that in the end all they need is heart — and each other. | | | | | |
