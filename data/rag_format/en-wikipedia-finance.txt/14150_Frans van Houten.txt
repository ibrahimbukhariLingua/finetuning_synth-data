# Frans van Houten



**François Adrianus "Frans" van Houten** (born 26 April 1960) is a Dutch businessman. He was the CEO of Royal Philips Electronics (known as Philips) from April 2011 to October 2022.


## Biography

The son of a member of the board of directors of Philips, Frans van Houten studied Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, and started his career at Philips in 1986 in marketing and sales at Philips Data Systems. He held several positions in the company, becoming co-head of the consumer electronics division in 2002.

In November 2004, he became CEO of Philips Semiconductors, where he led the spin-off of the division, resulting in the formation of NXP Semiconductors on 1 October 2006. Van Houten left his position as Chief Executive Officer at NXP on 31 December 2008.

On 8 July 2010, van Houten was nominated to succeed Gerard Kleisterlee as CEO of Philips in order to focus more on healthcare.

Since then, he and his team has driven the transformation and revitalization of the Philips portfolio to become a focused health technology company through targeted divestment, acquisition and organic business development. Under his first five years at Philips, shares moved mostly sideways, underperforming the benchmark AEX index by about 10 percent. In 2016, he floated Philips Lighting, the company's original business dating back to 1891, allowing the parent to focus on healthcare equipment. His strategy is also exemplified by the sale of the television business in 2012; the audio and video businesses in 2014. At the same time, Philips has invested in a number of acquisitions that strengthen the company's portfolio, among them medical device leaders Volcano and Spectranetics, respiratory care leader RespirTech, and population health management leaders Wellcentive and VitalHealth, as well as others in digital pathology, neurology, pregnancy & parenting, healthcare informatics and ultrasound. He's also driven increased investment in R&D to establish new businesses in areas like digital pathology, medical wearables and healthcare informatics.

On 16 August 2022, Philips announced that they had parted ways with van Houten due to a mass product recall of Philips Respironics CPAP devices that halved the company's stocks and would further reduce it below the value it had prior to his appointment as CEO.
