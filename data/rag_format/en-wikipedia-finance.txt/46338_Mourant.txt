## History

Mourant is the result of successive mergers of various law firms, most recently that of Mourant du Feu & Jeune and Ozannes in 2010.
In the same year, the Mourant group sells Mourant International Finance Administration to State Street, Mourant Private Wealth to RBC and Mourant Equity Compensation Solutions to HBOS. In 2018, it changed its name from "Mourant Ozannes LP" back to "Mourant LP".

In June 2023 Mourant confirmed the completion of its expansion into Luxembourg, with law firm, LexField, and governance services business, FideField, joining the Mourant global network. It follows the acquisition of a specialist accounting business in January 2022 and the launch of Mourant Consulting in 2021.

While primarily based in Jersey, Mourant has offices in other jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mauritius, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. The tax avoidance campaign group ActionAid reported that more than 200 companies belonging to at least 26 multinational companies have subsidiaries incorporated in Jersey at 22 Grenville Street, Mourant's headquarters.
