## History

Hanken was established in Helsinki on 1 September 1909, making it one of the oldest business schools in northern Europe, opening a month after the Stockholm School of Economics. The statutory meeting for Aktiebolaget Högre Svenska Handelsläroverket in Helsinki was held in December 1908, and only four months later the private community college under the name of *Högre Svenska Handelsläroverket* statutes were approved. In 1927, the school was given its current name, Svenska Handelshögskolan. The school introduced a bachelor's degree in economics in 1928, with professorships being introduced in 1934. The first doctoral dissertation took place in 1944.

In 2018, Hanken joined the Helsinki Graduate School of Economics. An initiative to bring together three Finnish universities – Aalto University, Hanken School of Economics, and the University of Helsinki.
