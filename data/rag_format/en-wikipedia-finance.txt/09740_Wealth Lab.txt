Wealth Lab


# Wealth Lab



**Wealth Lab** is a technical analysis and electronic trading platform previously owned by Fidelity Investments. The original software was developed by Dion Kurczek and released in 2000. The software was acquired by Fidelity Investments in 2004 and released to their customers as "Wealth Lab Pro". Fidelity decommissioned Wealth Lab Pro in July 2020. Shortly thereafter, the original Wealth Lab team rewrote the code base and independently released version 7. Currently, the client is at version 8 and runs on Microsoft Windows .NET 8. Users with subscriptions can program, backtest, and automate trading strategies for various financial markets, including stocks, futures, forex, options, and cryptocurrencies.


## Software

Wealth-Lab has an integrated programming environment based on C# syntax with added versatility derived from using its own pascal-like programming language, Wealthscript. Although it is geared toward programmers, it has a drag & drop feature that allows non-programmers to create their own trading strategies based on technical analysis without the necessity to edit or even view any source code. This ability to custom build trading strategies by dragging & dropping basic entry and exit modes and their indicators, not only allows non-programmers to create and use strategy scripts, it expedites the process of programming for both experienced and novice developers.

Wealth-Lab requires Market data in order to perform the majority of its operations. In its standard installation, several market data sources are provided such as Yahoo! Finance's free End Of Day data. Users can also lease real-time market data from reputable sources such as Commodity System Inc.

Displaying the market data in meaningful ways, i.e. charting, is one of the user's primary activity. Wealth-Lab displays market data in all the typical formats, namely, candlesticks, line, and OHLC; and even the non-typical formats such as kagi chart, Renko, equicandle to name a few. It also allows users to simply drag & drop one or more indicators, from its vast library, right onto a chart subsequently creating panels and annotations for each indicator. In addition to standard technical analysis indicators, users will also find a substantial amount of fundamental analysis indicators to apply to their charts.

Backtesting strategies is at the heart of Wealth-Lab. User can either "Explore & Backtest" or "Build & Backtest". ´Build´ refers to the drag & drop method of strategy creation where as ´Explore´ refers to prebuilt strategies that are pre-installed or can be downloaded from the support website, Wealth-Lab.com managed by WL Systems, Inc.. The advantage of the prebuilt strategies is the ability to optimize the parameters. The installation comes with two optimization methods: exhaustive or Monte Carlo which uses a unique method of employing random numbers to create simulations. There are many more Wealth-Lab optimizers that can be installed from Wealth-Lab's extension manager.

Developers can also program and share their own indicators, optimizers and strategy scripts, and it has been this open platform philosophy that has contributed to the establishment of a supportive developer's community.


## Client availability

Wealth-Lab 8 is available by subscription to customers worldwide without exception, including U.S. and Canada.

Version 6
Prior to August 2020, two legacy versions of Wealth-Lab existed. Wealth-Lab "Pro" was available to Fidelity premium account holders in the US (only). Consumers outside of the US (and Canada), however, could obtain a version of the software known as Wealth-Lab "Developer" via the support website. The difference between the two versions resided in their use of market data streams, custom software extensions, and technical support.

In August 2020, Fidelity discontinued the "Pro" version and transitioned customers to use Wealth-Lab Developer 6 and in March 2021 Wealth-Lab 7 was launched, supporting customers worldwide.

Automated strategy trading is possible by installing extensions for one or more brokerages. Although many of the core tools have the same functions as in prior versions, two unique tools are also available as extensions: the Candlestick Genetic Evolver and Indicator Profiler.
