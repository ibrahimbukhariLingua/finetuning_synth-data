## History

The buy.at affiliate network was founded in 2002 by British company Perfiliate Technologies Ltd, which was founded in 1999. The network grew to become the UK’s largest independent affiliate marketing network. The company generated an average 250% year-over-year revenue growth from 2004 to 2006. It was the UK’s ninth fastest-growing technology company in the 2007 according to *The Sunday Times'*s Tech Track 100, and the fastest-growing affiliate network in the UK according to *New Media Age* (NMA).

buy.at received several awards for campaign performance and overall operations:

In 2007, buy.at acquired Lightstate (rebranded as buy.at leads) to expand capabilities and product offerings for advertisers and affiliates in the lead generation space. The same year it expanded to the United States, opening an office in New York and launching Ticketmaster’s US affiliate program in December.

buy.at was bought by AOL in 2008 to operate as a wholly owned business unit of Advertising.com. This acquisition marked the official launch of buy.at’s network in the United States.

In 2010, AOL sold buy.at to Digital Window, who already owned Affiliate Window in the UK.

In 2017 the domain was sold again - together with a high quality .at domain portfolio - to company Frankcom IT Service in Germany.
