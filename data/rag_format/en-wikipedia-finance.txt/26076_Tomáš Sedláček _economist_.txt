## Economics of Good and Evil

The book *Ekonomie dobra a zla: po stopách lidského tázání od Gilgameše po finanční krizi* (published in English under the title *Economics of Good and Evil: The Quest for Economic Meaning from Gilgamesh to Wall Street*) is a modified version of Sedláček's thesis submitted – but rejected due to "questionable scientific value" – at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Charles University in Prague. The book became a bestseller in the Czech Republic.

In his book, Sedláček refuses the one-sided view of economics as a value-free mathematical inquiry. He describes economics as a cultural phenomenon and a product of our civilization closely tied with philosophy, myth, religion, anthropology, and the arts. According to Sedláček, economics should not concern only abstract mathematical modelling, but also societies' values.

The broad concept of the book covers the history of economics through the millennia, "from the epic of Gilgamesh and the Old Testament to the emergence of Christianity, from Descartes and Adam Smith to Fight Club and The Matrix."

Additionally, the book explores some of the fundamental and provocative questions of the present time: "Is growth the only answer? Are we addicted to desire? Does it pay to be good?"

In 2009, the book received the *Wald Press Award*. In 2012, the book won the "Deutscher Wirtschaftsbuchpreis" (2012 Frankfurt Book Fair Award) for the best economic title in Germany. The work was praised by the economics professor Deirdre McCloskey.
