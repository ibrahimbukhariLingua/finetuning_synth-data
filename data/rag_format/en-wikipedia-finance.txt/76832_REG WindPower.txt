## Proposed new wind farms

In October 2011, REG Windpower launched public consultation on several new wind farms in England.
If completed, these projects will have a combined installed capacity of almost 50 MW.

The projects are:

* Bank House Farm, Croft, North East Lincolnshire;
* French Farm Extension, Thorney, Peterborough;
* Grange Farm, Wiltshire;
* M48, South Gloucestershire;
* Mendennick, Cornwall;
* St Breock Repower, Cornwall;
* Steadfold Lane, Ketton, Rutland.
* Old River Don, Crowle, Lincolnshire
* Knockshinnoch, Rankinston, East Ayrshire
* Langthwaite, Millom, Cumbria

## Controversies

REG Windpower has attracted criticism over their selection of some of their development sites.

* Old River Don wind farm - the site chosen for 6 turbines was the site of two World War II graves. A Lancaster bomber crashed in September 1945 and two Australian airmen were never found. The location of one of the turbines was to be close to where the crash site was believed to be.
* Knockshinnoch Wind Farm - East Ayrshire Council Planning Committee granted consent for the site on 30 January 2015 despite an objection from West of Scotland Archaeology Service due to the existence of Carline Knowe, a prehistoric cairn sitting just a few metres from the base of the turbines. The site is located 200 metres from the edge of Dunstonhill surface mine which was abandoned following the collapse of Scottish Coal in April 2013. Many local residents were unhappy with further development in this area while Dunstonhill blighted the landscape. The site also sits just 488 metres from the nearest home despite Scottish Government Guidance recommending a minimum separation distance for this size of turbine (126.5 metres height) being 900 metres. In total 26 separate planning policies and guidance were breached however the Planning Committee overturned the advice of the Planning Department to refuse.
