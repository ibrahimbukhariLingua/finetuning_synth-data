## Research areas

IKEM is dedicated to climate protection issues and specializes in legal, economic and social science analyses that develop or optimize strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dealing with the consequences of climate change.

IKEM also conducts research into sustainable energy supply. Key areas include analyses on the expansion of renewable energies, energy efficiency, energy storage, Power-to-X and the transition to low-carbon economies.

In the field of transport, IKEM focuses on new forms of mobility, innovative mobility concepts, autonomous driving and electromobility. The research also examines the interactions of transport with economic, energy and climate policy issues.

The development of operator and business models as well as research into acceptance and user potential play a special role in all of these areas.


## Projects

IKEM works on scientific projects that are funded by public and private clients and funding organisations. These include the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, the Federal Environment Agency, various state ministries, companies and European funding programmes.
