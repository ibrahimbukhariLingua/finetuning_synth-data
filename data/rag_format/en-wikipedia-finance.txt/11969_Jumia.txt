## Short seller research

In May 2019, the short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research referenced Jumia as a "securities fraud", citing material discrepancies regarding key financial metrics among a confidential investor presentation and Jumia’s F-1 filing to the SEC from its April 2019 IPO. Andrew Left is known on Wall Street for making several claims of fraud and has faced calls to be investigated.
Jumia's share price sank more than 50% in one week after the report was published. Citigroup, one of Jumia’s IPO underwriters, released a report debunking most of Citron’s allegations but noted that, “Jumia could do more to provide disclosure on some aspects of its operations, as a matter of transparency and best practice.”
