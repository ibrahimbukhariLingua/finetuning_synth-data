## Early career


### VK.com

In 2006, he co-founded *VK.com* with his friends, Yitzchak Mirilashvili and Pavel Durov.

Leviev and Vyacheslav invested tens of thousands of dollars in the project. The money was borrowed from Mirilashvili-Sr. Leviev's share was 10%. From the moment of founding the company until 2012, he was the Chief Operating Officer of VK.com.

Yuri Milner's *Digital Sky Technologies* fund was the company's first external investor. He bought a quarter of the network in 2007 and later merged DST's shareholdings into the *Mail.Ru Group*. At the end of 2010, the holding increased its VK.com ownership stake by 7.5% - from 24.99% to 32.49%. Mail.ru Group secured the option to buy another 7.5% of VK.com in 2011.

In July 2011, Mail.ru exercised the option and increased its shareholding to 39.99% which reduced the total share of the partners from 55.5% to 48.01% making Leviev's share between 6% or 8%, according to various sources.

Having learned about negotiations between his fellow co-founders and Alisher Usmanov in March 2012, Durov deleted their profiles `id3` and `id4`. Leviev and Mirilashvili were planning to exit VK.com via an IPO for $3 bln, but at the end of March, Durov announced that the social network would not IPO for an undefined period.

In April 2013, Ilya Sherbovich's investment fund, *United Capital Partners*, paid an estimated $840 mln for the partner's share. Assuming a valuation of $1.75 bln for the entire network, Leviev would have received $105–140 mln.

During the conflict between *UCP* and Pavel Durov, the fund considered Leviev as a potential CEO of VK.com.


### Selectel

In 2007, Leviev and Vyacheslav Mirilashvili founded the *Selectel* data center network to provide for *VK.com*’s needs in processing and storing servers.

By 2009, *VK.com*’s full server capacity was being managed by *Selectel*. In 2012, *VK.com* opened its own data center, but it still remains a client of *Selectel*.

After selling his *VK.com* shares in September 2014, Leviev assumed the role of CEO at *Selectel*.

In May 2014, it was reported that *Selectel* was investing ₽1 bln in a technopark in Saint Petersburg that would include a data center, offices and warehouses.

By the end of 2016, *Selectel* was ranked the fourth largest IaaS provider for public and hybrid cloud in Russia (based on revenue).

By 2017, the company was one of the largest IaaS providers in Russia, with a market share of 7%. At the end of 2017, Leviev stepped down from the CEO position, while remaining the Chairman of the board of directors.


### Btc.com

In 2014, Leviev co-founded *BlockTrail* with his long time friend, Boaz Bechar. Leviev set up the holding company *BlockCorp* which made an initial investment of €500,000 in the *BlockTrail* project. The company developed a blockchain explorer, Bitcoin transaction analytics tools and multi-platform Bitcoin wallets.

In 2016, the project was bought by *Bitmain*, a Chinese producer of equipment for mining Bitcoins, and renamed *BTC Wallet* (btc.com).
