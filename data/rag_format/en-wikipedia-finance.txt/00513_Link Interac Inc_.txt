## Etymology

The name is an acronym for *International Education Research and Analysis Corporation*, although the company has never operated under that name.


## Description and history

Interac is Japan’s largest private provider of professional foreign teachers to the Japanese government through its ALT program. As one of the largest non-government employers of foreign nationals in Japan they employ nearly 3,500 staff in Japan across a network of 13 offices. Around 3,200 of these employees are non-Japanese.

Interac began as a provider of corporate educational services but from the mid-nineties began providing ALTs and education-related services to Boards of Education across Japan.

The company has fifteen domestic branches within Japan, with associated offices in Salt Lake City and Oxford. There are approximately 100 administrative staff, and a teaching team of over 2,500 ALTs and language teachers for English and other languages.


## Clients

Link Interac has fifteen branches servicing over 7000 different client organizations. Mostly these are local boards of education to whom Interac provides ALTs. The scope of this teaching in public schools is quite large, and the estimate based on government figures is that about 17.33%, or 1 in 5.76 students, is taught by an Interac teacher weekly. About 10% of its business is in providing language instruction to companies such as Ito-Yokado, Honda, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, and NEC, as well as Japanese governmental organizations such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency.
