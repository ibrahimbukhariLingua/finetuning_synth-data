## History

Dundas & Wilson traces its roots to 1759 when David Erskine founded his own legal practice in Edinburgh. Sir James Dundas of Ochtertyre Clerk to the Signet subsequently joined the practice and, after the death of David Erskine, William Wilson joined the partnership to form Dundas & Wilson. From at least 1841 the firm had offices at 16 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh. The firm remained at the Square until 1991.

The firm was active in Scotland during the 19th century as can be seen from the numerous references to the firm in Court of Session reports or old Sasine titles.

Dundas & Wilson became a limited liability partnership in 2004.

In May 2014 Dundas and Wilson combined with CMS.
