# NJM Insurance Group



**NJM Insurance Group** is an American mutual insurance group of companies, offering personal auto, commercial auto, workers' compensation, homeowners, condo, renters, and umbrella insurance. It is headquartered in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey, and serves markets in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.


## History

NJM Insurance Group, originally known as New Jersey Manufacturers Casualty Insurance Company, formed as a workers’ compensation insurance company on June 7, 1913, two years after New Jersey passed the Workmen's Compensation Act which required all employers to carry insurance coverage for injured workers. The company's original goal was to provide cost-effective, safety-conscious, and financially secure insurance to New Jersey business owners. By 1922, the company was the largest provider of workers’ compensation insurance in New Jersey.

In 1921, NJM began providing insurance for property loss, commercial auto accidents, private automobiles, and homes.

On January 1, 1965, the New Jersey Manufacturers Indemnity Insurance Company (founded as the New Jersey Manufacturers Fire Insurance Company on December 6, 1921) merged into the New Jersey Manufacturers Casualty Insurance Company to form the current legal entity. The merger had been announced on April 24 of the prior year, with approval being granted by the Commissioner of Insurance on October 28.

NJM's main office has been in West Trenton since 1966. Personal Lines and Commercial Lines Underwriting, General Claims and Medical Services Administration are headquartered there, as are most support services for company operations. NJM has had additional offices in northern New Jersey since the 1950s, but the company's main North Jersey branch has been consolidated in Parsippany since 1996. The southern New Jersey branch opened in Hammonton in 2000.

In 2015, American soccer player and long-time NJM policyholder Carli Lloyd was announced as the company's spokesperson. This partnership ended after Lloyd's retirement in 2021.

In 2018, NJM expanded its services to Pennsylvania residents.

In 2019, services were expanded into Connecticut, with Ohio, Delaware, and Maryland following in 2021.
