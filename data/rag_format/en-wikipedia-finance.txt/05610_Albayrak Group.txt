## History

**Albayrak Group** is a joint venture by Ahmet Albayrak and his brothers Bayram Albayrak, Nuri Albayrak, Kazım Albayrak, Mustafa Albayrak, and Muzaffer Albayrak. The group kicked off commercial activities in 1952 in the construction industry upon initiatives by Hacı Ahmet Albayrak.

Albayrak Group traces its origins to Hacı Ahmet Albayrak, who contributed to rebuilding efforts after the 1939 Erzincan earthquake. Officially established in 1952 with the founding of Albayrak Construction, the company has since completed over 20,000 housing units, metro projects, hospitals, shopping malls, tunnels, administrative buildings, energy plants, and factories. The group remains 100% family-owned.
