## History

It started operating in 2012 as a website-based service for corporate car bookings, and evolved to become a ridesharing company with car hire for everyday use.

## Criticism


### Regulations


#### Taxi protests in Egypt

Uber and Careem faced heavy criticism in Egypt at the beginning of 2016 from local taxi drivers for operating without official taxi licenses. Taxi drivers organized several protests and sit-ins demanding that the Egyptian government intervene to halt the activities of the TNCs. A committee was organized by the Egyptian government to assess the complaints of the protesting taxi drivers and standardize taxi services in Egypt. They ruled in favor of the TNCs, ensuring that they can operate legally and provided legal protection for the TNC drivers who had been facing attacks by both state police and angry taxi drivers.


### Data breach

In January 2018, Careem discovered data on more than 14 million riders and 558,800 drivers were breached. The company waited until late April 2018, to disclose this breach because they "wanted to make sure we had the most accurate information before notifying people". According to investigations conducted by the company, there was no initial evidence of fraud or misuse.


### Work culture and working conditions

Careem has faced a wave of criticisms centered around their work culture and hiring practices. These criticisms have been amplified through various social media platforms.

In a LinkedIn post from June 2023, Mudassir Sheikha outlined the type of professionals Careem is looking to hire. He stated that the company is not the right fit for those whose top priority is cash compensation although he highlighted that Careem offers competitive compensation. He also said that it's also not a right fit for those looking for a 9 to 5 job, or those who thrive with structure and certainty. He emphasized that Careem is more focused on impact and fulfilling its purpose rather than offering high cash compensation or a structured work environment. The post received a significant amount of backlash. Commenters argued that competitive cash compensation is essential for attracting high-quality talent and that neglecting this aspect could lead to high turnover rates. Others sarcastically remarked that who needs cash compensation when one can have the satisfaction of creating impact.

A Business Insider article highlighted the criticisms Mudassir Sheikha faced for his LinkedIn post. The article noted that tech workers took to the employee forum Blind to criticize the CEO's post as "tone-deaf" and "cringe." One comment translated the CEO's message as, "we’ll pay you peanuts, put you in a cramped space with little amenities, provide no training, work you till you burn out and quit so the execs and owners can get a fat payout on the back of your labor." The article also mentioned that many comments on LinkedIn took issue with the CEO's statement. The article also said that not all the comments were negative and that Careem continually benchmarks its salaries against a peer group of leading global companies. The article further quoted comments that praised the LinkedIn post for being "rare" and "honest". It also referenced an article from the UAE newspaper The National News reporting that "hundreds of Careem employees had walked out of the Uber acquisition millionaires due to the $3.1 billion payout".

Careem has received mixed reviews from its employees on Glassdoor, a platform where employees can review their employers. While some employees praised the company for its culture, flexible working hours, and open communication, others criticized it for a lack of supportive management, unfair expectations, and a toxic work environment. Some of the specific criticisms included no work-life balance, a lot of work on weekends, bad management, a lot of firings, low pay, and extended working hours being forced despite having a contract stating maximum working hours in a week. One comment also claimed that Careem manipulates its review score on Glassdoor with fake reviews. According to the UAE-based newspaper Khaleej Times, Careem colleagues "rate their job satisfaction and loyalty [to Careem] way above tech industry averages". The article cited that Careem's unlimited leave policy "gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to recruiting talent" and helps "reverse brain drain from the region".


## Sustainability

Careem launched Careem Bike in partnership with the RTA in 2020 to support the UAE's target to cut emissions by 40% by 2030. In 2022, RTA announced that 2.8 million Careem Bike trips had been completed since its launch, reducing emissions by 1,926,033 kilograms, equivalent to emissions from 600 cars. 53% of Careem's trips in the UAE had been completed with hybrid or electric vehicles in 2023. In the same year, Careem expanded its EV fleet in Jordan to form 45% of the fleet in Irbid. Careem unveiled its plans to introduce Dubai's first fleet of electric motorbikes and charging station infrastructure at Careem Bike stations in 2024. The company announced that the electric engines are powered by 4,000 watt lithium battery packs that can be charged at 192 Careem stations across Dubai. The electric motorbikes aim to reduce the carbon footprint of delivery trips by up to 24 tonnes of C02 per day, and provide cost savings for Careem Captains. Careem introduced 'Eco-friendly' rides in 2023 during COP28 in partnership with CarbonSifr to support carbon removal projects in the UAE and the wider region, with customers' contributions going into supporting high-integrity environmental projects such as planting mangrove trees in the UAE. The initiative offset more than 200 tonnes of CO2e in under 3 months [3]. Following its success in Dubai, Careem's eco-friendly rides were launched in Abu Dhabi in 2024. Another such sustainability campaign was launched in collaboration with Careem and Mastercard, where for every Careem Pay wallet top-up transaction using a Mastercard debit card, Emirates Nature-WWF pledged to plant a mangrove in the UAE on behalf of the cardholder.
