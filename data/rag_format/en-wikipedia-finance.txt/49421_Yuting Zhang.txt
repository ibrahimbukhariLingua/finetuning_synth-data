## Biography

Professor Zhang obtained her PhD in health policy (economics concentration) at Harvard University in 2007 and MS in health policy & management, also from Harvard University. She received her BA from Renmin University of China.

Yuting Zhang is currently a professor of health economics at the Melbourne Institute: Applied Economic & Social Research within the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne. She is currently the founding director for the Health Analytics, Leadership, and Economics (HALE) Hub. Before that, she was a tenured professor at the University of Pittsburgh. She was the founding director of the Pharmaceutical Economics Research Group since 2010.

Her expertise is with using advanced econometrics and statistical methods and large data sets to design rigorous observational studies to study causal relationship between health policy/interventions and outcomes including patient health, healthcare spending, and quality of care. These empirical studies are motivated by two overarching goals: first, to design studies to identify causal relationships between health policy/interventions and health outcomes rather than mere correlations; second, to provide guidance on how health policies can be designed to achieve efficiency and high quality of care in the healthcare system.

Her research areas include pharmaceutical policy and economics, mental health policy, value-based healthcare design, comparative effectiveness analysis, health insurance markets, the effect of healthcare reforms on healthcare spending and quality of care, and international health.

Zhang's research has been published in prestigious medicine, health policy, and economics journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Health Affairs, and the American Economic Review.

Zhang has been interviewed extensively by reporters from television or radio broadcast, magazines and newspapers, including *The New York Times*, *The Wall Street Journal*, *American Health Line*, *USA Today* *Business Week*, *The Washington Post*, ABC News and CBS News

She is on the advisory board of Lancet - Regional health west pacific, an associate editor of the *Journal of Mental Health Policy and Economics*, and an appointed method/statistical reviewer at JAMA Network Open. She has also served as a consulting advisor to the Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and a reviewer for the NIH, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and the US Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.
