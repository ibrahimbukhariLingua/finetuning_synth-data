Society for Business Ethics


# Society for Business Ethics



The **Society for Business Ethics** is a non-profit organization established in 1980 to promote the advancement and understanding of ethics in business. Its mission is to provide a forum in which moral, legal, empirical, and philosophical issues of business ethics may be openly discussed and analyzed. Members include scholars, students, and professionals from several countries with a common interest in research, teaching, or the application of ethical principles to business management. The society sponsors a scholarly journal, *Business Ethics Quarterly*, publishes a newsletter, and hosts an annual conference. Individual members receive access to the journal, the right to vote for candidates for the Board of Directors, and a discount on registration for the annual conference.
