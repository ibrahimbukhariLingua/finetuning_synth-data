## Early life

Torstein Dale Sjøtveit was born in Miland, a small village 12 km outside the small industrial town of Rjukan, in Norway. His interest in industrial development can be attributed to the transformative impact of hydropower upon his hometown of Rjukan, turning it from a remote rural area located in a narrow valley just under Gaustatoppen – one of Norway's highest mountains – to an important industrial town and a famous Norwegian tourist destination.

Torstein attended the Finance and Administration College at Rjukan from 1972-73. He then went for training at the Technical College for Civil Engineering at Porsgrunn from 1976–78 and the Technical College in Civil Engineering at Stavanger from 1978-79.

The ongoing Penan literacy programme provides basic reading, writing and numeracy skills for close to 500 people in the six Penan indigenous communities in Murum. With support from rural communities, besides literacy and numeracy, the programme has focused on new ways of thinking to improve living conditions, including health, hygiene, nutrition and gardening. The program endeavours to help the communities make the most of new opportunities arising through the community's resettlement programme.

Besides learning new skills, the program has been successful in providing key motivation to the community, with a strong focus on the importance of education.
