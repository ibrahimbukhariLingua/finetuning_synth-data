National Economic Council (Indonesia)


# National Economic Council (Indonesia)



The **National Economic Council** (Indonesian: *Dewan Ekonomi Nasional*) is an Indonesian government economic advisory council that advises the President on strategic economic policy formulation and recommendation. The council is led by a chairman, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, since 21 October 2024 (2024-10-21).

First established on November 30, 1999 under the leadership of President Abdurrahman Wahid. However, this institution was disbanded through Presidential Decree No. 122/P of 2000 in less than a year of its operation on September 1, 2000.

On October 20, 2024, the National Economic Council was re-established by President Prabowo Subianto with institutional status at the same level as a ministry based on Presidential Decree No. 139/P of 2024.

Despite originating from the former Coordinating Ministry of Maritime and Investment Affairs, the council does not coordinate technical ministries like coordinating ministry. The council only produces presidential studies containing strategic economic policy formulations and recommendations reserved for the president's eyes only. The coordination of economic affairs is done by the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, except fiscal and monetary which are the domains of the Ministry of Finance.
