# Naftal



**Naftal** (Arabic: نفطال) is the principal company selling
petroleum-based fuels for domestic consumption in Algeria; its gas stations are a familiar sight throughout the country. Founded in 1981 by government decree, it was responsible for refining and distribution until 1987. In 1998, it became a subsidiary of Sonatrach. It employs about 30,000 workers, and has about 2300 gas stations (as of 2017).


## Activities

Naftal specializes in the distribution and sale of finished petroleum products and operations of service stations for the domestic market. Naftal managed 1,400 service stations in 2012.

Naftal produces lubricants and naphthenic oils. Naftal manufactures its products in refineries operated by Sonatrach.

In March 2022, Naftal signed a US$364 million engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract with Sonatrach's pipeline unit TRC. The pipeline is planned to take about 48 months to construct, and will run 424 km from Arzew to Chlef, carrying about 1.2 million tonnes of LPG a year.
