## Controversies


### Ermūhamet Ertısbaev interview

In 2004, when Interfax interviewed Ermūhamet Ertısbaev in November 2004, he referred Subkhanberdin as "Kazakh Khodorkovsky." Ertısbaev, speaking in favor of legislation that would limit the abilities of "various elite groups" to influence politics through lobbying, told Interfax that "in the transition period, in the post-Soviet area, any attempt from the oligarchs to influence... the president, the Parliament and the government can result in serious political cataclysms." Critics, such as reporters for *Respublika*, said the government's de-monopolization campaign would give Kazakhstanis a chance "to see how the government will put monopolists and their protectors from the head of state's inner circle in their place."


### Meridian

In November 2017 the OCCRP published an investigation into Meridian based on the Paradise Papers leak. According to the OCCRP findings, in 2006 Subkhanberdin was the largest single shareholder of Meridian with a 25% stake.
