Rajmohan Pillai


# Rajmohan Pillai



**J. Rajmohan Pillai** (born 12 May 1964) is an Indian businessman, and is currently the chairman of Beta Group.


## Early life

Rajmohan Pillai was born in Kerala, India, and educated in the state capital Trivandrum. He gained management experience with his family's business in 1981.


## Beta Group

Beta Group is a diversified transnational business group with a US$2 billion turnover. The group’s vertical subsidiaries include packaged processed foods manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. The Group also claims interests in entertainment, logistics, and business consulting.

The group began in the early 1900s as Beta Industries, an exporter of cashew nuts. The company is based in the Netherlands. It is one of the world's largest cashew nut companies.

Rajmohan Pillai formed the Beta Group as a conglomerate of nine companies in memory of his eldest brother, Kerala businessman Rajan Pillai, former chairman of Britannia Industries, whose death in 1995 closed what *The Economic Times* referred to as one of India's most dramatic corporate sagas.

Today, while still essentially a cashew products company, the Beta Group has diversified into fruit drinks, almonds, dates, and pistachios. The group owns the dry fruit and nut brands, Nut King and Ole.


### Pillai's management

Pillai's previously declared intentions for the group have included:

* waging a "cashew-nut war", matching the price of potato chips marketed by multinational companies in India (2000)
* entering the pharmaceutical and hospitality sectors (2006)
* purchasing the Barista Coffee chain (2006) (it was purchased instead by Lavazza)
* diversification including a US$200 million desalination plant in Tamil Nadu (2006)
* opening an aviation academy in Malaysia (2007)
* resurrecting the Britannia Amritraj Tennis (BAT) Academy, a former Chennai center of excellence, in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, as Beta Ace Technique (BAT) Tennis Academy
* investing $100 million in Guinea-Bissau's cashew industry (2023)

## Social foundations

He was instrumental in establishing the *KJP Research Foundation*, named in honor of his late father, K. Janardhanan Pillai. The Foundation conducts research and development in the fields of cashew and other horticultural crops. He also established the *Rajan Pillai Foundation* in memory of his brother Rajan Pillai, to promote excellence in arts, sports, social sciences, and medicine, serving the cause of humanity. The Rajan Pillai Foundation institutes and presents awards to accomplished individuals in international relations, social welfare services, and industry development.
