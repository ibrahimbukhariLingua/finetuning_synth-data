## History

EDB ErgoGroup ASA was formed in 2010 with the merger of EDB Business Partner and ErgoGroup. Telenor owned most of the shares of ErgoGroup. The company subsequently changed its name to EVRY ASA in April 2012.

In August 2014, EVRY announced it was initiating a process to investigate strategic opportunities. This was motivated by its assessment of the IT sector in the Nordic countries. In March 2015, Apax Partners became the majority owner of the company, a new board was appointed, and it decided to apply for a delisting from the stock exchange. On 29 October 2015, the company was delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange.

In August 2015, following the loss of a contract with the Norwegian bank DNB, EVRY announced it would lay off 500–550 workers in Norway and Sweden to increase profits, saving NOK 400–500 million (about US$50–60 million). In October 2015, it announced the transfer of 600 employees to IBM in an outsourcing deal worth US$1 billion.

On 13 December 2018, Handelsbanken and EVRY agreed to deliver next-generation core banking and payment services in Finland. The agreement represents a total contract value of approximately NOK 650 million and runs for eight years.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
