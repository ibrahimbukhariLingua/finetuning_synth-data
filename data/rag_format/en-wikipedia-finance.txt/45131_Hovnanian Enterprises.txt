## History

In 1959, Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian originally from Iraq, and his three brothers, Hirair Hovnanian, Jirair Hovnanian and Vahak Hovnanian, each contributed $1,000, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed, to found Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. in a trailer in Toms River, New Jersey.

Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost condos and townhouses, many to first time young homeowners and families. A typical two-bedroom, two bathroom Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated amenities such as communal swimming pools, which other builders used to attract potential buyers. In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, "There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization."

In 1964 Jirair Hovnanian split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey. Hirair and Vahak also left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises.

Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989. An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include luxury homes, mid-priced homes and retirement communities. It remains one of the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.

Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, Ara K. Hovnanian. He remained chief executive until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian. However, he remained the chairman of the company's board of directors until his death in 2009.


## Quality

Hovnanian has been the subject of customer complaints. In a few cases, there have been legitimate construction problems in some Hovnanian houses. For example, in 2005, Hovnanian acknowledged problems in a development in New Jersey after nearly three dozen disgruntled homeowners turned to elected officials when their complaints were ignored.

K. Hovnanian the home builder and the mortgage company are no strangers to controversy. In 2008, the home builder was involved in a class action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their subdivision was built near an old bombing range. The company settled the lawsuit in 2011 for a reported $1.2 million.

The mortgage company was involved in a class action lawsuit filed in 2007 alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for removing incentives from home buyers if they opted to use another title insurance provider rather than the Hovnanian-affiliated title insurance company.


## Charity

* K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital was named after builder Kevork Hovnanian after his foundation contributed the "largest donation the hospital had seen in its 101 year history."
* Ocean Medical Center expanded in 2013 when it began an $82 million expansion project to substantially increase the capacity of its emergency room facilities and add additional basement and third floor space, funded in part by the family of Kevork Hovnanian who donated $5 million to the cause.
