# The Raine Group



**The Raine Group**, commonly referred to as **Raine**, is a global merchant bank focused exclusively on industries related to technology, media and telecommunications (TMT). Companies the firm has been involved with significantly include Endeavor, SoftBank Group, WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship. It has also been involved with several Premier League football clubs.

Outside the U.S., the firm has offices in Europe and Asia.


## Background

In September 2009, Raine was co-founded by Joseph Ravitch and Jeffrey Sine. Ravitch was previously co-head of Goldman Sachs' media banking division while Sine was Vice Chairman and head of TMT banking at UBS. It was compared to the early formation of the Quadrangle Group which also had a TMT focus. The firm's name Raine comes from an amalgamation of Ravitch's and Sine's surnames with the "e" on the end coming from Ari Emanuel, an initial backer who headed William Morris Endeavor. One of Raine's first major deals was advising William Morris Agency on its merger with Endeavor Talent Agency to form William Morris Endeavor.

In March 2010, Mubadala Investment Company acquired a 9% stake of Raine. Raine would also enter an exclusive relationships with William Morris Endeavor and Theodore J. Forstmann as investors. SoftBank Group also holds a small stake of Raine.

In April 2023, Raine acquired Code Advisors, a San Francisco-based boutique investment bank that also focuses on TMT. It was done as the two had already worked together on a number of deals for the same clients.

Sources state that Sine is more active on the advisory side while Ravitch is more active on the investment side.
