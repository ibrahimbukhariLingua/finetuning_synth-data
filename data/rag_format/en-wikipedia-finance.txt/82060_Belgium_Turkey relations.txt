Belgium–Turkey relations


# Belgium–Turkey relations



**Belgian–Turkish relations** are foreign relations between Belgium and Turkey. Belgium has an embassy in Ankara, a consulate–general in Istanbul and two consulates in Antalya and İzmir. Turkey has an embassy in Brussels and a consulate–general in Antwerp.


## History

Relations between the two countries started in 1837 with the recognition of independent Belgium by the Ottoman Empire. Diplomatic relations were established in 1838.


## Political relations

Belgium and Turkey are both members of the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Union for the Mediterranean. Also Belgium is a European Union member and Turkey is a candidate.

The approximately 230,000 Turkish citizens living in Belgium constitute an important aspect in Turkey's relations with Belgium. They come predominantly from the Emirdağ district, located in Afyonkarahisar, Turkey.

In March 2019, the Turkish foreign ministry summoned the Belgian ambassador, Michel Malherbe, and relayed Turkey's unease after a Belgian court blocked the prosecution of some 30 people with alleged links to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).

Belgium condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria and called on Turkey to halt it immediately. The Belgian government later decided to implement an arms embargo against Turkey.


## Economic relations

Trade volume between Turkey and Belgium has increased remarkably over the years and reached $ 6.886 billion in 2017. In 2017, Belgian exports to Turkey were $ 3.729 billion, whereas Turkish exports to Belgium were $ 3.127 billion. Belgium is the seventeenth largest trade partner of Turkey.

The Turkish–Belgian Business Council, and organisations with similar aims, give priority to promoting commercial linkages. This council was established in 1990.

There are more than 200 Belgian firms operating in Turkey. The value of Belgian investments in Turkey is around $ 320 million. On the other hand, the investment of Turkish companies in Belgium has exceeded $ 8 billion.

In 2017, 419,998 Belgian tourists visited Turkey.
