**Summit Hills** is a 908-acre real estate development in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. The development includes a convention centre, hotel, recreational facilities, and golf course with clubhouse, nature reserve, hospital and a variety of residential units. It is being developed by a group of public and private investors, including the Cross River State Government.


## History

Summit Hills was conceived in 2013 by the then-governor of Cross River State, Senator Liyel Imoke, as a way to diversify the state's economy and create jobs. The project is expected to cost over $5 billion US and is being completed in several phases.

The first phase, completed in 2015, included the construction of the Calabar International Convention Centre (CICC), the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel, Calabar, and the Calabar Golf Course and Clubhouse. The second phase, currently underway, includes the construction of a nature reserve, a hospital, and various residential units.


## Impact

This project is expected to have a significant impact on the economy of Cross River State. It is estimated that the project will create more than 10,000 jobs and generate over $1 billion in revenue for the state annually. The development is also expected to attract tourists from around the world. The CICC is one of the largest and most modern convention centers in Africa, and the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel is the first international hotel to open in Calabar in over 30 years.


## General information

Although still in the construction phase, the project is expected to be comparable in size to the Canary Wharf Business District in London or the Lower Manhattan district in New York City. The site includes a nature reserve for endangered species of monkeys native to Cross River State along with nature trails.

The development will be rolled out gradually in four phases. The first phase, ongoing, features the construction of the main road, followed by the CICC and the CICC Hotel. The second stage is the development of the residential area and the hospital. The third phase will see the completion of the golf course, clubhouse, and additional residential areas.
