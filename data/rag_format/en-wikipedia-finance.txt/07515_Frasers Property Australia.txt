In 1997, Australand was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and the Singapore Exchange. In 2000 Walker Corporation was acquired, with FCL beginning its first development in Australia – the Pavilions on the Bay at Glebe Point. Between 2001 and 2002, the Australand Wholesale Property Trusts were established and in the following year, the Australand Property Trust was renamed Australand Property Group. In 2011, Australand was listed on the Australian real estate investment trust index while delisted from the Singapore Exchange. In 2014, Australand was acquired by Frasers Centrepoint and privatised in October of that year. The same year, FCL formerly the property arm of the Fraser & Neave group, was listed on the SGX. In August 2015 Australand adopted the Frasers Property brand. In October 2015 Frasers Property Australia launched a retail business unit.
