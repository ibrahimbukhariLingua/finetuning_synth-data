## History


### Predecessors


#### Jacobs Douwe Egberts

Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) originated from the Dutch company Douwe Egberts, with roots in a grocery store founded in 1753. In 1978, Douwe Egberts was acquired by the American company Sara Lee Corporation. In 2012, Sara Lee spun off its coffee and tea division into D.E Master Blenders 1753 NV to focus on its core consumer products business.

In 2013, the German investment group JAB Holding acquired D.E Master Blenders for $9.8 billion. In 2014, the company merged with the coffee division of American conglomerate Mondelez International, creating one of the largest coffee companies in the world.


#### Peet's Coffee

Peet's Coffee was founded in 1966 in Berkeley, California. The company was acquired by JAB Holding in 2012 for $977.6 million. Over the years, Peet's had expanded through acquisitions, including Mighty Leaf Tea (2014), Stumptown Coffee (2015), and Intelligentsia Coffee (2015).


### Formation (2015–2020)

In 2015 Jacobs Douwe Egberts merged with Peet's Coffee, both now majority-owned by JAB Holding, to form JDE Peet's. On May 29, 2020, JDE Peet's raised $2.5 billion by taking the company public on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in a deal that valued the company at $17.3 billion.

In July 2021, JAB Holding named Giancarlo Moreira as Chairman of the Board JDE Peet's. The company opened new JDE Peet's locations in Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Utah, Nevada, Arkansas, Alabama and New Mexico, and also launched new JDE Peet's locations in international markets like United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Israel, Jordan, South Korea and Japan. Moreira expanded JDE Peet's a long term deal with Major League Soccer club Inter Miami CF.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

JDE Peet's chose to continue doing business in Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The company's CEO cited three reasons for staying in Russia: 1. Coffee and tea are essential products; 2. To protect local employees in the country; 3. The company's intellectual property would be seized if it left Russia.

In October 2024, JAB Holding announced it would acquire Mondelez International's 17.6% stake in JDE Peet’s for €2.16 billion ($2.34 billion), increasing its ownership in the coffee company to approximately 68%.
