Fair Trade Commission (Japan)


# Fair Trade Commission (Japan)



The **Japan Fair Trade Commission**' (*Kōsei Torihiki Iinkai* (公正取引委員会, **FTC**) is the competition regulator in Japan. It is a commission of the Japanese government responsible for regulating economic competition, as well as enforcement of the Antimonopoly Act. Headed by a chairman, the commission is commonly known as *Kōtori* (公取) or *Kōtorii* (公取委).


## Notable activities

On July 13, 2004, the commission asked Microsoft to remove a clause which it thinks is hurting activities of Japanese companies getting licenses of Microsoft Windows from Microsoft. Microsoft had previously faced another action from the JFTC when Japanese manufacturers were forced to include Microsoft Word on new systems instead of homegrown word processor software Ichitaro.

In March 2024, the JFTC accused Nissan of violating the Subcontractor Act by underpaying dozens of suppliers by some 3 billion yen ($20.26 million).

In November 2024, the commission reportedly raided Amazon Japan's corporate offices as part of an investigation into potential violations of the Antimonopoly Act.
