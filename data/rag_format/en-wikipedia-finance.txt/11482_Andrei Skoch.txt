## Controversies and sanctions

In relation to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 23 February 2022, Skoch was added to the EU sanctions list, citing the following reason:

Putin on the need to recognize the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic" and therefore supported and implemented actions and policies which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, and further destabilised Ukraine.
