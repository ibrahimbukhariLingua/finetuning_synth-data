New York State Housing Finance Agency


# New York State Housing Finance Agency



The **New York State Housing Finance Agency** (**HFA**) is a New York State public-benefit corporation created in 1960 to increase the supply of rental housing for low-income people by issuing bonds and providing low-interest mortgage loans to regulated housing companies.

The Housing Trust Fund Corporation (HTFC) focuses on the broader goal of affordable housing development and tends to concentrate on rental housing, the Affordable Housing Corporation (AHC) works to promote affordable homeownership, and the Homeless Housing and Assistance Corporation (HHAC) concentrates specifically on providing housing solutions for homeless populations. They focus on funding for organizations, while the separate State of New York Mortgage Agency (SONYMA) offers affordable mortgage products directly to homebuyers.

Developers can take advantage of several financing resources when they obtain HFA financing. These include the All Affordable Housing Program for developments in which 100% of the units are affordable; the Mitchell Lama Rehabilitation and Preservation (RAP) program, which helps renovate state-financed Mitchell Lama projects; and the 80/20 New Construction Housing Program, which provides financing for rental projects where at least 20% of the units are set aside for low-income tenants.


## Organization

HFA was created by statute in 1960, which was recodified in 1961.

HFA and its subsidiaries are now administered by New York State Homes and Community Renewal, created in September 2010 to include the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.

In 2017, the HFA had operating expenses of $368.76 million, an outstanding debt of $16.780 billion, and a staffing level of 263 people.

The Agency also acts as the administrative arm of the **Project Finance Agency**, the Affordable Housing Corporation and the **Municipal Bond Bank Agency**.

The New York State Housing Trust Fund Corporation (HTFC) is a subsidiary of the HFA that administers the Low Income Housing Trust Fund Program; the purpose of which is to grant or loan up to $40,000 per housing unit. The advance may be used to rehabilitate vacant or under-utilized residential property, or convert vacant non-residential property to residential use for occupancy by low income homesteaders, tenants, tenant-cooperators or condominium owners. In 2017, the Housing Trust Fund Corporation had operating expenses of $2.835 billion and a staffing level of 219 people. It was created along with AHC in 1985.

In 2017, the AHC had operating expenses of $2.65 million and a staff level of 199 people. The compensation for its staff exceeds its listed operating expenses by just under $4 million in the 2018 New York State Authorities Budget Office report. It was created along with HTFC in 1985.
