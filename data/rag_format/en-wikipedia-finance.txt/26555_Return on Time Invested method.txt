**Return on Time Invested** (**ROTI**) is a productivity and efficiency metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of time spent on a given activity, project or product. It is analogous to the financial concept of Return on Investment (ROI) but focuses on the qualitative and quantitative returns gained from the time invested, rather than financial capital. ROTI is particularly useful in contexts where time is a critical resource, such as in Product management, personal productivity, and organizational efficiency.


## Origins

The concept of ROTI has evolved alongside the increasing focus on productivity and efficiency in both personal and professional contexts. While the exact origin of the term is not well-documented, it gained prominence in the early 21st century as knowledge work and time management became crucial components of business success. The widespread adoption of digital tools and the need for efficient time allocation in various sectors further propelled the importance of measuring time-related returns. Publications like Forbes have highlighted the significance of time management and productivity in numerous articles, emphasizing the relevance of concepts like ROTI in modern work environments.


## Calculation

The calculation of ROTI can vary depending on the context and specific metrics being evaluated. However, a general formula can be expressed as: ROTI = Total value or Output obtained / Total time invested.


### Steps for calculation

1. **Identify the activity or product**: Clearly define the scope and objectives of the activity, project or product for which ROTI is being calculated.
2. **Measure time invested**: Track and record the total amount of time spent on the activity.
3. **Evaluate output or value**: Assess the qualitative and quantitative outcomes resulting from the time invested. This could include completed tasks, achieved milestones, acquired skills, or generated revenue.
4. **Compute ROTI**: Divide the total value or output obtained by the total time invested to determine the ROTI.

### After a meeting

Evaluating ROTI at the end of a meeting helps determine whether the meeting was a valuable use of time for the participants. Organizers can use digital tools to streamline the ROTI assessment process, making it easier to collect and analyze data.

1. **Ask for feedback**: At the conclusion of the meeting, ask participants to rate the meeting's value. This can be done through a quick verbal poll or a more structured approach using a survey tool.
2. **Rate the value**: Use a simple scale (1 to 5) where participants rate how valuable the meeting was in terms of achieving its objectives and contributing to their work.
3. **Measure time spent**: Record the total time spent in the meeting, including preparation and follow-up activities if relevant.
4. **Calculate ROTI**: Analyze the feedback to determine the average value rating and compare this against the time invested in the meeting.

## Areas


### Product management

In product management, ROTI is used to assess the efficiency of time allocation across various tasks and phases of development. By calculating ROTI, product managers can identify areas where time is being used effectively and areas that require optimization.


### Personal productivity

Individuals use ROTI to enhance personal productivity by evaluating how their time is spent on different activities. This helps in prioritizing tasks that offer higher returns on time invested and minimizing time spent on low-value activities. Media outlets like Inc. frequently offer tips on maximizing personal productivity, often referencing the principles behind ROTI.


### Organizations

Organizations leverage ROTI to improve overall efficiency by analyzing how employee time contributes to business goals. By understanding the ROTI of different processes and functions, organizations can streamline operations and allocate resources more effectively. Reports in Harvard Business Review have highlighted case studies where businesses improved their efficiency through better time management and ROTI assessments.


## Benefits

* **Improved time management**: ROTI provides a clear metric for evaluating how time is being used, leading to better time management and prioritization.
* **Enhanced productivity**: By focusing on activities with higher ROTI, individuals and organizations can achieve more with the same amount of time.
* **Data-driven decision making**: ROTI offers a quantitative basis for making decisions related to time allocation and resource management.
* **Increased accountability**: Tracking ROTI encourages accountability for how time is spent and the outcomes achieved.

## Criticisms

While ROTI is a valuable metric, it also has limitations:

* **Subjectivity in value assessment**: The qualitative nature of some outcomes can make it difficult to accurately measure the value obtained.
* **Time tracking accuracy**: Precise tracking of time invested is crucial for accurate ROTI calculation, which can be challenging in dynamic or multitasking environments.
* **Contextual variability**: The applicability and interpretation of ROTI can vary widely depending on the context and specific goals of the activity, project or product.
