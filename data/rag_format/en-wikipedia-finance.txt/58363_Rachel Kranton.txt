# Rachel Kranton



**Rachel E. Kranton** (born c. 1962) is an American economist and James B. Duke Professor of Economics at Duke University. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts & Science, Fellow of the Econometric Society, and 2010 recipient of the Blaise Pascal Chair. She was elected to serve on the Executive Committee of the American Economic Association from 2015 to 2018. Kranton's research focuses on how social institutions affect economic outcomes, and has applications in a variety of fields within economics, such as economic development, international economics, and industrial organization.

More specifically, Kranton studies social networks and develops formal theories of how social networks affect economic behavior, the effects of buyer-seller networks, institutions in colonial India, and reciprocal exchange. By this, she's a major contributor to the emerging new field of economics of networks. She uses formal models of strategic interaction in select economic settings, and draws on these findings through mathematical tools to find how network structures influence economic outcomes. She also focuses on the cost and benefits of networks and informal exchange, which is the economic activity through social relationship.

In a long-term collaboration, Kranton and George Akerlof of University of California, Berkeley introduce social identity into formal economic analysis. In 2010, Akerlof and published *Identity Economics,* which provides a comprehensive and accessible discussion of their research. In a review for Science, Robert Sugden writes: "Nonspecialist readers will find a lot of insightful and well-informed analysis of how issues of identity affect real economic problems." Bloomberg lists *Identity Economics* as one of the top 30 business books of 2010.

## Recognition

Rachel Kranton was elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2020. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2021.

Rachel Kranton was recognized in an article by Gregory Phillips (a communications manager at the Fuqua School of Business & staff member at Duke University)'Desire To Be In A Group Leads To Harsher Judgement Of Others,' which recognized Kranton for her study of "groupiness." This study divided a portion of 141 participants into
three different settings, including, 1)declared political leanings, 2)a more neutral group using the participants preferences of similar poems and paintings, 3)a random grouping. These three groups were asked to distribute money amongst themselves in their groups, or to themselves and someone outside their group. This test was used to determine if there were discriminatory factors against people outside of their groups. Yet, the result of this study found that this separate grouping created biases against people outside of their group, regardless of their political beliefs. It was found that a third of the participants were more likely to be politically independent and not have a group bias in the allocation of these assets. Some of the other findings was that the "groupiness" of people does not relate to gender or ethnicity.
