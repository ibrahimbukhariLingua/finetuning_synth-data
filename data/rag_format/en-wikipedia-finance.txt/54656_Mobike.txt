## History

In 2015, Mobike was established by a former journalist Hu Weiwei. Co-founder Wang Xiaofeng, the general manager for the Shanghai office of Uber also known by his English name Davis Wang, became Mobike's CEO.

In December 2016, the company made Shanghai the world's largest bike-share city.

In June 2017, Mobike raised $600 million in Series E funding led by Tencent, bringing the firm's fund raising in 2017 alone to nearly US$1 billion. In the same month, the company was valued at US$3 billion.

In August 2018, Mobike launched an electric version of their orange bicycle.

In December 2018, Hu Weiwei resigned as chief executive for "personal reasons" and was replaced by Eric Yu Liu .

## Design features

As described by the company, Mobike is intended to solve the last mile
issue in which commuters face the problem of being stuck a bit too far from their destination to walk, but too close to justify the cost or delay of finding a taxi. Similar to Call a Bike in Germany, every Mobike bicycle comes with an internet-controlled electronic wheel lock that automatically unlocks but requires manual locking after use.

Mobike bicycles are powered by a small generator installed on the rear wheel hub to power the lock, or by a PV panel in some bike models. The patented disc brake is said to withstand over 10,000 kilometres of riding without failure.

Mobike has partnered with Qualcomm (using their IoT chip MDM9206) and Gemalto for the use of NB-IoT technologies to provide connection for the bikes.

Mobike bicycles come in two versions, both of which requires a scan of a unique QR-code to unlock:


### Classic Mobike

The Classic Mobike, or "Mobike", is the standard variant of Mobike bicycles. It has an all-aluminium, V-shaped chassis, puncture-proof tires, and a shaft transmission system. Instead of conventional wire spokes, it uses five sets of two thick, parallel, metal rods positioned at 72° from each other to improve durability and lower maintenance costs. The identification number of each bicycle is put on the rear part of the chassis.

Renters scan the QR-code, which is displayed at the base of the handle as well as on the smart lock.

The livery is black for the seat, handlebars and the lock, orange for the wheel and metallic silver for the body.

The bicycle weighs 25 kilograms (55 lb).

Some users have complained about the Classic Mobike's weight and the lack of a bicycle basket (defended by Mobike as to "prevent spam advertising"), and difficulty in keeping balance on their first attempts, which kickstarted the development of Mobike's second iteration, the Mobike Lite.


### Mobike Lite

Mobike Lite is known informally as "generation 2". It uses wire spokes and a conventional chain drive to deliver torque to the rear wheel. The identification number is on the right side on a plastic panel that protects the chain. The QR code has moved to the tip of the rear fender.

The Mobike Lite comes with a net-like metal basket and has a solar panel that powers the QR lock and GPS tracker. The wheels were coloured orange.

Newer models of the "Mobike Classic" and "Mobike Lite" have adjustable seats. The Lite weighs 17 kilograms (37 lb).


### Second generation

According to a company press release, small batches of second generation Mobikes, both Classic and Lite, are being deployed in areas of service. Reports indicate that the second generation bicycles use a more durable aluminium kickstand rather than the formerly used hard plastic ones. Also mentioned is the new hydraulic adjustable seat installed on Generation 2 bicycles through depression of a small metal tab near the base of the seat. Finally, the second generation Classic Mobikes now also have a basket.

The colour scheme of the second generation Mobike Lite is changed to orange for the inner rim, and reverts to black for the tyre.


## Access

Access to Mobike bicycles requires the Mobike application, which takes a minimum deposit of one unit of country-specific currency to ensure the user supplied payment details are correct. Each user is required to register using their mobile telephone number. In China they must also register their national identification number as required by local government regulations; the software does not allow users under the age of 14 to use the app, through the identification number.

To use a bicycle, the user unlocks the bike using the mobile app. The app records the distance and duration of the trip and the energy the user spent using the bike. At the end of the rental the cost is deducted from the user's account.


### Payment

As Mobike has no offline services, the Mobike app only accepts online transactions through AliPay, WeChat Pay, or credit card. The user needs to have a positive balance in their account when starting the rental, but it is allowed to go negative during a trip.

The company previously required deposit in order to use the service in China, however the company ended the practice in July 2018. Users are free to withdraw their deposit from the service at any time as long as they do not have a negative account balance.


### Mobike Score

The Mobike app initially used a "Mobike Score" system to keep track of user behaviour. The score system consisted of five levels: Outstanding (1000–701), Excellent (700–601), Good (600–501), Fair (500–301), Poor (300–0). Users' Mobike Score affected future fares and use of the system. Every new user automatically started with a "Good" score of 550 points. Users were awarded points for various actions such as reporting any problems with the system or parking in preferred areas with higher demand, and lost points for actions detrimental to the system, which could lead to account suspension. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Issues

Mobike has several problems with practicality. Many people complain about bikes causing clutter; as they do not have fixed-station parking locations, users can leave Mobikes where they cause obstruction. In response to these complaints, Mobike has introduced parking zones to encourage users to park in specific areas.

In some global markets such as the UK, there has been much reported vandalism of Mobikes.
