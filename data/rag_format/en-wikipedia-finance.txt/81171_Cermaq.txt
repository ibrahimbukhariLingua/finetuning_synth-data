## History

Cermaq was founded as **Statkorn Holding** when the commercial division of Statens Kornforretning (now Statens Landbruksforvaltning) was demerged and made a limited company in 1995. The company operated grain wholesaling. In 1996 the company started to purchase NorAqua, a fish food producer, and in 1998 Cermaq started purchasing fish farms. In 2000, the government sold the first 20% of the company. Through the 2000s, Cermaq has sold its original grain wholesaling divisions and entered the seafood and fish food market. It was listed on Oslo Stock Exchange in 2006. Cermaq's feed business unit EWOS was sold in 2013.
In October 2014, the acquisition of the firm was completed by Mitsubishi Corporation for $1.4 billion.
