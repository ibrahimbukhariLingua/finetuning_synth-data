Advance-Decline Data


# Advance-Decline Data



The **Advance-Decline data** also known as AD data are calculated to show the number of advancing and declining stocks and traded volume associated with these stocks within a market index, stock market exchange or any basket of stocks with purpose of analysis of the sentiment within the analysed group of stocks. **Advance-Decline data** are used to measure overall market breadth as well as to measure sentiment within the stock market sectors.

First time Advance-Decline data were calculated and analyzed back in 1926 by Colonel Leonard Ayres, an economist and market analyst at the Cleveland Trust Company. Later James Hughes pioneered the "*Market Breadth Statistics*". In 1931 *Barron's* started to publish Advance-Decline numbers. Advance-Decline data analysis remained in shadow until the early 1960s when Richard Russell (Dow Theory) started to use them in his *"Dow Theory Letters"* and Joseph Granville used them in his *"Granville Market Letter"*.


## Advancing and Declining stocks.

Stock considered as **advancing stock** when it is traded above the previous trading session's close price.

Stock is considered as **declining stock** when it is traded below the previous trading session's close price.


## Advance-Decline Volume

**Advance Volume** refers to the cumulative total number of shares traded for all stocks from the group of the Advancing stocks within a given time frame.

**Decline Volume** refers to the total cumulative number of shares traded for all stocks from the group of the Declining stocks within a given time frame.


## Breadth Indicators

Breadth indicators represent the group of technical indicators that are based on the Advance-Decline data.


### Advance-decline line

A-D Line = [Advancing Stocks] – [Declining Stocks] + [Previous Period's A-D Line Value]


### Advance-Decline Oscillator

A-D Oscillator = [Advancing Stocks] – [Declining Stocks]


### Advance/Decline Ratio

A/D Ratio = [Advancing Stocks] / [Declining Stocks]


### Advance-Decline Percentage Oscillator

A/D PO = ([Advancing Stocks] - [Declining Stocks]) / ([Advancing Stocks] + [Declining Stocks]) x 100


### Absolute Breadth Index

ABI = abs([Advancing Stocks] – [Declining Stocks])


### Breadth Thrust

Thrust = [x-Day Moving Average of Advancing Stocks] / [x-Day Moving Average of (Advancing Stocks + Declining Stocks)]


### TRIN Arms Index (see TRIN (finance))

TRIN = (([Advancing stocks]/[Declining stocks]) / ([Advancing volume]/[Declining volume]))


### McClellan oscillator

McClellan Oscillator = (EMA1 of [(Advancing Issues - Declining Issues)/Total Issues] - EMA2 of [(Advancing Issues - Declining Issues)/total issues]) \* 1000


### McClellan Summation Index

Index = Previous Index's Value + Current McClellan Oscillator Value
