**Quikjet Cargo Airlines Pvt. Ltd.**, branded as **Quikjet Airlines**, is an all-cargo airline based in Bangalore, India. In December 2022, Quikjet resumed operations with a new AOC.


## History

The airline was formed in 2007, promoted by AFL Pvt Ltd. Switzerland-based Farnair picked up a 36.2% stake in the airline in February 2012, making AFL the second-largest shareholder with 20.8% stake in the carrier. QuikJet had operated one of Farnair's twelve ATR 72-200Fs until March 2013 before temporarily closing shop in anticipation of a B737-400F. In May 2015, India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved Farnair's plan to incrementally increase its stake in Quikjet Cargo Airlines from 50.93% to 72.59% involving a minimum total foreign direct investment of Rs. 14.4 crores. Quickjet launched scheduled domestic cargo services using 737-400F aircraft. The airline started scheduled cargo flights on 16 February 2016 using a Boeing 737.

In late 2014, after its acquisition of Farnair, ASL Aviation Holdings became the majority shareholder of Quikjet Airlines.

In August 2022, Quickjet Cargo took delivery of its first Boeing 737-800F with another one on order. Quickjet Cargo will be operating for Amazon Air in India.
