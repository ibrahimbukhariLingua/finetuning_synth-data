The **Kulmbach Brewery Corporation** (German: *Kulmbacher Brauerei AG*) was founded in 1895 under the name *Reichelbräu* in Kulmbach, a city in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, Germany.


## History

The success of the brewery started with the export of Kulmbach beer to Central, East and North Germany.

Since 1980 the Kulmbach Brewery Corporation has been noticed for its steady expansions. In 1980 and 1984 the company merged with the companies Sandlerbräu and Mönchshof-Bräu GmbH and two more brands of beer was added to the product line.

In 1986, the Schörghuber Unternehmungsgruppe took over 49,9% of the share capital. The expansions continued in the 1990s with the take-overs of the companies Sternquell Brauerei, Plauen, the Braustolz Brauerei in Chemnitz, Eku as well as a majority of the stock in the Bad Brambacher mineral spring. Since 1996 the brands EKU, Reichel, Sandler and Mönchshof are under the roof of the Kulmbach Brewery Corporation. In 2002, the beverage production exceeded three million hektolitres.
