# Impelsys



**Impelsys** is a global technology company founded in January 2001. The company is headquartered in New York and operates in the United States, European Union, and India. It supports businesses worldwide in their transition to digital-first, data-driven operations.


## History

Sameer Shariff founded Impelsys in January 2001 in New York. He is an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School of Business. Initially, the company developed digital platforms for e-books and learning management systems. In 2009, they built the ipublishcentral product. This platform allowed publishers to have a digital warehouse to store all their content, which could then be distributed to various retail outlets like Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and many others. Impelsys expanded into healthcare, publishing, information services, and education.

In 2020, the company launched its iPC Health platform, which provided training and skill development programs for healthcare staff, along with a learning management system for hospitals. In 2021, the company spun off iPC Health into a separate entity and rebranded it as MedLern. In April 2021, MedLern partnered with RCNi, a unit of the Royal College of Nursing UK, to provide the CPD Certification programs to Indian hospitals. Impelsys also launched iPC Scholar in 2021, which utilizes AI and machine learning infrastructure to develop e-learning tools. In 2023, Impelsys opened an advanced medical device testing lab in Mangaluru, Karnataka, and partnered with Laerdal. In March 2023, Anand Ramachandran was appointed as CRO and Barry Bealer as Vice President for Publishing, Information, and Education.
