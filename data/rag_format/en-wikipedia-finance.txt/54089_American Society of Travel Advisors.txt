## History

The American Society of Travel Advisors (ASTA) was founded on April 20, 1931, in New York City as the American Steamship and Tourist Agents Association. ASTA changed its name to the American Society of Travel Agents in 1944. On January 26, 2000, ASTA acquired the assets of The National Association of Commissioned Travel Agents, Inc. (NACTA) which is now a membership subsidiary, called National Association of Career Travel Agents since 2009. NACTA represented independent travel agents, cruise-oriented agents, home-based travel agents and outside sales travel agents. On August 28, 2018, the organization was renamed to the American Society of Travel Advisors. NACTA was also rebranded into the ASTA Small Business Network.

ASTA supported the Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 Act (H.R. 4450; 113th Congress), a bill that would extend the provisions of the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 111–145 (text) (PDF)), which established the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as Brand USA), through September 30, 2020, and impose new performance and procurement requirements on the corporation. ASTA President Zane Kerby said that the bill "is essential to marketing the United States as a desirable destination for international tourists, conferences and business."

In 2022, ASTA supported the Travel and Tourism Omnibus Act, which among other things, creates an Assistant Secretary of Travel and Tourism at the U.S. Department of Commerce, elevating the importance the U.S. travel industry plays at home and abroad.
