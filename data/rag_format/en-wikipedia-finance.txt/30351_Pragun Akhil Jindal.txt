## The Black White & Grey

The Black White & Grey: Recoloring The Rupiah was e-launched by Honourable HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar.

The book, titled 'The Black White & Grey - Re-Coloring The Rupiah', authored by Pragun Jindal and published by Money Worries, looks at the black money menace and ways to curb it.

In this book, the author unfolds this dark world, which eats into an idea of an equal world where the rich get richer staying on the dark side while the poor are marginalized. There are tricks to keep the cover of darkness intact and every time an effort is made to lift the veil, the tricks become sharper.

This book looks at the world that thrives in the shadows, fueled by money that exchanges hands in the dark and never gets reported – "The Kala Dhan."

Senior Congress Leader Manish Tewari, Former Central Board of Direct Taxes Chief Sudhir Chandra and political commentator Paranjoy Guha Thakurta on 13.12.2016 formally launched the book which attempts to debunk "a lot of lies, unknown facts and baseless rumours about Black Money". "A delinquent like poverty only affects the poor, unemployment affects those who are unemployed, alcoholism and drug abuse affect those who devour them, black money is a hitch which does not affect persons who amass 'black dough' but it affects the common man in the populace," said the author at the launch event held at India Habitat Centre in New Delhi.
