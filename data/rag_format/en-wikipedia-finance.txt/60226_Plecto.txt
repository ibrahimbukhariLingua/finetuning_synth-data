# Plecto



**Plecto** is a business performance platform designed to help businesses get an overview of their performance metrics. The company was founded in 2012 in Aarhus, Denmark and operates worldwide.


## History

Plecto was founded by Kristian Houlberg Øllegaard and Steffen Bagge in 2012.

At the time, Kristian Houlberg Øllegaard was employed in a retention department in a local call center. Frustrated by having to manually keep track of sales and retentions, he decided to develop a software that could automate this process.

Shortly after that, Kristian Øllegaard decided to leave his formal studies at the university and instead dedicate his time to Plecto.


### Funding

In 2014, investor and founder of Just-Eat, Jesper Buch, entered the company providing the first round of funding. Two years later, in January 2016, the company was granted a loan from the Danish Growth Fund to implement their plans for growth. Other investors include Jan Dal Lehrmann, co-founder of BilBasen, and CEO of Benjamin Media, who in 2017 invested in Plecto to further new expansion.


## Markets

As of March 2017, Plecto serves customers in 30 countries across the world.
