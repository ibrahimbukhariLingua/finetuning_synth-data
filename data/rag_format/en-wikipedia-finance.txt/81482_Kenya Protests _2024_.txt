Kenya Protests (2024)


# Kenya Protests (2024)



In 2024, Kenya witnessed significant protests in its capital, Nairobi, against proposed tax hikes in a new finance bill. These demonstrations were primarily fueled by anger over the rising cost of living and growing taxes.


## History

The protests began with more than 200 people being arrested, as civil society groups and citizens expressed their opposition to the bill. Despite these arrests, demonstrations and a planned sit-in outside parliament buildings continued.

Nairobi Police Commander Adamson Bungei stated that no group had been granted permission to protest, despite the constitutional right to peaceful assembly. Police responded to the protests by using tear gas and forcing businesses to close temporarily due to fears of looting.


## Response

In response to the public outcry, the Kenyan government scrapped several proposed tax increases.

16% value-added tax on bread was removed, along with proposed taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil, and mobile money transfers.

Kuria Kimani, the chairman of Kenyaâ€™s Finance and National Planning Committee, emphasized that these changes were made to protect Kenyans from the increased cost of living.
