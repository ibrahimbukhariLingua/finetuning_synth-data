* **Ke –** Is used as an abbreviation for Cost of Equity (COE). Ke is the risk-adjusted, theoretical rate of return on a Company's invested excess capital *obtained through external investment*s. Among other things, the value of Ke and the Cost of Debt (COD) enables management to arbitrate different forms of short and long term financing for various types of expenditures. Ke applies most prominently to companies that regularly generate excess capital (free cash flow, cash on hand) from ongoing operations. Critically, in assessing a company's financial position (and reading its balance sheet), COE is distinguished from CAPEX, or costs associated with Capital Expenditures. Ke is most often used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), in which Ke = Rf + ß(Rm-Rf). In this equation, Ke (COE) equals the anticipated return from the difference (Beta) of investment yields from a return based on market expectations (Rm) and a Risk Free Rate (Rf), such as Treasury Bills or Bonds.
