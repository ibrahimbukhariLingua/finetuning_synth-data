## Release and reception

The film opened to mixed reviews during November 2016, with a critic from The Times of India noting the "filmmaking lacks the zaniness that such a screwball premise requires and the TV serial-like visuals take some time getting used to", suggesting that "the pacing, too, feels slow for a film that is basically one madcap chase". The New Indian Express gave the film a more positive review suggesting that "what is laudable is that Goutham has moved away from the routine formula track and cliches" and "what is also appreciable is that he stayed focused on his theme and was not distracted by unwanted elements like fights and comedy tracks".
