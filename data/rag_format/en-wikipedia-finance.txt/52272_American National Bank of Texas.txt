## Charter

Formerly named American National Bank of Terrell, the bank’s current charter dates to July 1, 1981, as a commercial bank, with a federal charter supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).


## History and predecessors

The predecessor of ANBTX—Waters, Bivins & Corley Bank—was the first bank founded in Terrell on November 22, 1875. The bank’s building was destroyed by a fire in 1882, but bank records and securities were protected in the bank’s vault. The bank relocated to Moore Avenue in Terrell; today that location houses the Terrell banking center for ANBTX. After some early partners joined and left the bank, the bank merged with Harris Bank and renamed itself Harris National Bank in 1895. In 1903, the bank changed its name to the American National Bank of Terrell. In 1930, the American National Bank of Terrell merged with federally chartered local bank First National Bank. In 1995, American National Bank of Terrell changed its name to its current name, American National Bank of Texas.
