# M&Co.



**M&Co Trading Limited**, trading as **M&Co.**) is a Scottish online retailer and former high street chain store selling women's, men's, and children's clothes, as well as small homeware products. Its head office is in Inchinnan, Scotland, though its main buying office is in London. Previously, its head office was at Caledonia House in Paisley. The company previously operated as **Mackays Stores Limited** until its 2020 administration, previously trading as Mackays.

Established in 1834 as pawnbrokers, Mackays switched to selling clothes in 1953 by brothers Len and Iain McGeoch. In 2005 the company rebranded as M&Co. to reflect a more modern image.
The chain operates over 300 stores and also has an online presence.

M&Co. closed all of its stores in April 2023 and moved to a sole online company.
