Beer in Tanzania


# Beer in Tanzania



**Beer** **in Tanzania** (known as *bia* in Swahili) have a long history in the country. Beer and alcohol is an integral part of Tanzanian society and local brands hold a strong sense of national pride among the Tanzanian population. There is a considerable amount of brewing and drinking done in the country. Tanzania ranks 6th in Africa for beer consumption and contributes to over 3% of the African consumption. However, over 90% of the national consumption is either homemade or from the informal sector. Bottled beer is expensive for the majority of the population and is almost 6 times more expensive than the maize beers. Nonetheless, beer sales and taxes are a vital part of the Tanzanian economy.

Beer is largely dominated by Tanzania Breweries Limited and East African Breweries Limited under the local company Serengeti Breweries Limited. Both companies have some of the largest revenues in the country and are listed on the stock exchange. Tanzania Breweries Limited is the largest taxpayer in the country and made over 3 trillion Tanzanian shillings in revenue in 2022.

Both the companies were merged in 1936 to form the current still operation company of the East African Breweries Limited (EABL). Tanzania Breweries was nationalized by the government in 1976 as part of the Arusha Declaration and then sold to SABMiller in 1993 after 25 years of failed operations. The company's ownership composition has changed various times, however, SABMiller still holds the majority stake in the company and is now listed as **TBL** on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange.
