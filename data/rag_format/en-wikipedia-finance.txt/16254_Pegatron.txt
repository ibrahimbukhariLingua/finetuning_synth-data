# Pegatron



**PEGATRON Corporation** is a Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company that mainly develops computing, communications and consumer electronics for branded vendors. It also develops, designs and manufactures computer peripherals and components. PEGATRON's primary products include notebooks, netbook computers, desktop computers, game consoles, handheld devices, motherboards, video cards and LCD TVs, as well as broadband communication products such as smartphones, set-top boxes and cable modems.


## History

In January 2008, ASUS began a major restructuring of its operations, splitting into three independent companies: ASUS (focused on applied first-party branded computers and electronics); PEGATRON (focused on OEM manufacturing of motherboards and components); and Unihan Corporation (focused on non-PC manufacturing such as cases and moulding). In the process of the restructuring, a highly criticised pension plan restructuring effectively zeroed out the existing pension balances. The company paid out all contributions previously made by employees. On 1 June 2010, ASUS spun off PEGATRON.

PEGATRON has in recent years become a significant components supplier for Tesla. During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, PEGATRON had to halt their production when some employees tested positive for the virus. PEGATRON's India plant took over some production of Apple iPhones due to the pandemic affecting its Shenzhen operations.

### Subsidiaries


#### Unihan Corporation

As part of the corporate restructuring of ASUS in 2007, PEGATRON acquired Unihan Corporation from ASUS in January 2008. Since 2008, the Unihan Corporation has been a subsidiary of PEGATRON Corporation that designs and manufactures computers, computer peripherals and audio-video products.


### Corporate social responsibility

In June 2008, with its PUreCSR corporate responsibility system, PEGATRON became a member of the EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition), a group of companies in the electronics industry that supports the implementation of the Code of Conduct throughout the electronics and information and communications technology supply chain, ensuring safe working conditions, respect and dignity to employees, and environmentally responsible manufacturing processes. PEGATRON's corporate responsibility system, PUreCSR (which stands for PEGATRON & Unihan *re*duce, *re*use, *re*cycle, *re*covery, *re*place & *re*pair Corporate Social Responsibility), meets the international standards: the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, the OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health & Safety Management System, and the QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management System. On 18 May 2010, the board of directors at PEGATRON unanimously approved to appropriate a sum within 0.5% of net income every year to charity.

## Controversies


### Working conditions

In December 2014, a BBC investigation exposed poor working conditions and employee mistreatment at PEGATRON factories making Apple products near Shanghai. It found staff being forced to work eighteen days in a row without any days off, workers falling asleep on the production line during shifts lasting between 12 and 16 hours, forced overtime, and a cramped dormitory room which twelve workers were forced to share.

In August 2016, China Labor Watch published a report which stated that working conditions had not improved since 2014. The average worker at PEGATRON's Shanghai factory works 80 hours of overtime a month. Over 62% of workers worked more than 100 overtime hours in March 2016. Workers are required to perform up to 1 hour a day of unpaid overwork. 64% of its maintenance department interns are overworked. At the same time, over 96% of PEGATRON workers are only making minimum wage, well below Shanghai's average income despite the extra overtime hours they put in.

In November 2020, Apple discovered that PEGATRON was using student workers in factories in mainland China. Due to this, Apple suspended their business with PEGATRON and stated that they would not grant the company any new business until this practice was ceased.

In December 2020, PEGATRON's Shanghai subsidiary Pegaer Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.「昌碩科技」broke out in labor disputes. Thousands of people gathered to ask for salaries. In response, the factory director led the beatings of the people who had gathered, and many police officers came to the scene to suppress it. Some people were beaten to the ground, and many of their fates remain unknown. More than ten people were arrested, triggering a rights defense incident (cited article does not support these allegations).|
