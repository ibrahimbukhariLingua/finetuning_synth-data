## Investment philosophy

Harris Associates is considered to be a value investor. The investment process entails investing in businesses that are trading at a discount to intrinsic value. The intrinsic value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account the quality of management and the company's ability to grow. According to research by Morningstar in April 2013 which analyzed the performance of the seven Oakmark funds over a five-year period, four were ranked in at least the top 2% in their relevant categories.


### Investment managers

As of 2020, notable investment managers include Bill Nygren, who joined in 1983 is known for a value investing approach.


## Supreme Court case

In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear *Jones v. Harris Associates*, a suit brought in federal court by a group of mutual fund investors against the firm. The mutual fund investors, who are investors in the Oakmark funds, claimed that the funds have overpaid their advisor (Harris Associates), and that the fees that Harris Associates charges Oakmark investors are higher than the fees that Harris charges institutional clients.

The suit previously had been thrown out by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2008, with a judge who is a noted free-market backer, Richard Posner arguing that sometimes marketplaces need to be reined in.

In March 2010, the Supreme Court unanimously vacated the Seventh Circuit's ruling and remanded the case.
