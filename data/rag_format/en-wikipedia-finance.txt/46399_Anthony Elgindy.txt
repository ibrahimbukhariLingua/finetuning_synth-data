### Insider trading

After 2000, Elgindy began working with FBI agent Jeff Royer, and gave him information on companies he believed were engaging in illegal activity. Royer used FBI databases to search for any investigations into those companies by the FBI or the SEC.

An investigation uncovered his relationship with Royer, who resigned and began working directly for Elgindy. Royer's girlfriend, FBI agent Lynn Wingate, continuing to funnel information to Elgindy. In 2002, Elgindy, Royer and Wingate were indicted for their roles in the scheme.

Elgindy and Key West Securities were fined $51,000 and had their NASD memberships revoked. In 2004, the SEC reversed the ban on appeal.
