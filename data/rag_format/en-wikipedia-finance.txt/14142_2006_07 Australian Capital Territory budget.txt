2006–07 Australian Capital Territory budget


# 2006–07 Australian Capital Territory budget



The **2006–07 Australian Capital Territory budget** for the financial year 2006–2007 was presented to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly by Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory Jon Stanhope on 6 June 2006. Stanhope is also the Treasurer, with this budget being the first he has presented as Treasurer.
Among the most-discussed elements of the budget were its planned closure of 39 schools in the Territory as part of its "Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools" vision for education in the Territory.

Stanhope asserted in a *Letter to the People of the ACT*, that this is the "first time in 17 years that any ACT Government has embarked on strategic and structural reform of this magnitude." He asserts that demographic shifts have led to 18,000 empty desks in ACT government schools and that it costs up to $10,000 more per year to educate children in schools with low enrolments, compared with a child at a school which is at or near capacity. Quoting figures from the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Stanhope argues that "it costs some 20% more, across the board, to deliver basic services like health and education in the ACT than the national average.". The budget announcements have provoked strong criticism from the ACT Council of Parents and Citizens Associations, Australian Education Union ACT branch, the ACT Opposition and members of the public.
