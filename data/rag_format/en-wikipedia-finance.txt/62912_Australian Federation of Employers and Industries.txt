# Australian Federation of Employers and Industries



**The Australian Federation of Employers and Industries** (AFEI) is an independent peak employers group - one of the oldest business advisory organisations in Australia. AFEI has been a major party in running almost every major test case in the NSW industrial jurisdiction. AFEI is a major contributor to the formulation of employer policy and is actively involved in all major workplace relations issues affecting Australian businesses.


## History

AFEI was founded in 1903 as the Employers' Federation of NSW. It later became a national organisation and was renamed Employers First, changing to the Australian Federation of Employers and Industries in 2008.
AFEI is a not-for-profit organisation with over 3,500 members and more than 60 affiliated industry associations. Its main role is to advise, represent and assist employers in meeting their obligations relating to workplace relations, to assist them with human resources management, to provide OHS and other relevant training and, importantly, to seek appropriate regulation from government. Membership extends across employers of all sizes and a wide diversity of industries. Garry Brack is CEO of AFEI.
