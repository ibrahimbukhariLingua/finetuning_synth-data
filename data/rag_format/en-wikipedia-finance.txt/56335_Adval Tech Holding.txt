## History

Adval Tech Holding began in 1997, in Bümpliz-Oberbottigen, Bern. It was founded by Fritz Styner and Rudolf Bienz as a collective company originally called 'Styner + Bienz.' In 1942, the company was converted into an Aktiengesellschaft (stock market company). In 1963, Styner and Bienz relocated to Niederwangen. In 1974, with the addition of 73 employees from AWM, in Muri, Sydney, and Frankfurt, the company entered the field of plastic injection molding technology. In 1985, Styner + Bienz AG became the first company in the Canton of Bern, the first in the industry, and the sixth in Switzerland to be awarded the ISO Certificate Swiss Norm SN-029-100. The company was renamed 'Adval Technology' in 1997 and was listed on the stock exchange in 1998, the same year it conducted its initial public offering (IPO). Shares of Adval Tech Holding AG are traded on the Zurich stock exchange. In August 2010, the injection molding division 'FOBOHA' was sold to the Barnes Group. In March 2014, the Adval Tech Group consolidated all of its global mold construction activities under the brand Adval Tech Foboha. Barnes Group Inc. has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Adval Tech's molds business (FOBOHA) in July 2016. AWM Adval Tech created tools for manufacturing CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, CD covers, and automotive parts as a subcontractor of Sika AG for BMW, Honda, and other car manufacturers. Company apprentices learn specialty extrusion blow-molding. The company has employed 1,341 people since Q3 2017 and reported a turnover of 104.2 million Swiss Francs. In 2018, Adval Tech (Thailand) was acquired by Sunningdale Tech, another manufacturer of precision plastic component.
