China's Super Consumers


# China's Super Consumers



***China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell It to Them*** is a 2014 nonfiction book by Savio S. Chan (陳少宏, Pinyin: *Chén Shàohóng*) and Michael A. Zakkour, published by John Wiley and Sons. The book discusses how U.S. businesses may market products to customers in mainland China.


## Authors

Chan is the president and CEO of the consulting company US China Partners Inc., and Zakkour is a principal at Tompkins International, serving in its China/APAC sector.


## Critical reception

Jack Maher, a Princeton in Asia fellow, wrote in the *Asian Review of Books* that *China's Super Consumers* did not factor into account the anti-corruption drives of Xi Jinping and the increase of Chinese domestic brands, and both aspects would require Western companies to take additional cautions.
