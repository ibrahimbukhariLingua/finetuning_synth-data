# List of former stock exchanges in the Americas



This is a list of former stock exchanges in the Americas, including North America, South America, and the Caribbean Islands. Year of formation and the year the exchange was acquired, liquidated, or folded are also included. Some of these exchanges remain active as subsidiaries or divisions of other current exchanges (*see current stock exchanges in the Americas*). See *regional stock exchanges* for a related list of American stock exchanges, both active and defunct.

When the SEC formed in 1934, a total of 24 securities exchanges registered with the SEC, while 19 received temporary exemptions from registration. Ten stock exchanges closed after the SEC was created, while others decided to stop trading in securities. The National Stock Exchange ceased trading operations on May 30, 2014, bringing the number of active stock exchanges in the United States to 11. Wrote *Bloomberg*, that left "just one public exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange Inc., that isn't owned Bats, Nasdaq OMX Group or IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc."
