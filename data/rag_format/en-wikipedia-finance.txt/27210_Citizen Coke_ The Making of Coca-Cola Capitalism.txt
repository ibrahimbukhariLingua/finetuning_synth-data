***Citizen Coke: The Making of Coca-Cola Capitalism*** is a 2014 nonfiction book written by Bartow J. Elmore.

## Critical reception

*The New York Times* wrote "'Citizen Coke' began as a dissertation, and its points are lucid and logically presented; the language is accessible, and punchy chapter endings propel the story. But as a narrative, the structure is riddled with redundancies and leads to chronological whiplash."

*Kirkus Reviews* dubbed it "A superb, quietly devastating environmental and business history."

*The Wall Street Journal* wrote "In 'Citizen Coke,' Bartow J. Elmore meets the challenge. He examines an old story in a very new way, offering unaccustomed perspectives on a company whose leading product is a household name around the globe."
