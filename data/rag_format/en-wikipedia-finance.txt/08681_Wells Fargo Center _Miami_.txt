Wells Fargo Center (Miami)


# Wells Fargo Center (Miami)



The **Wells Fargo Center** (previously known as **Met 2 Financial Center**) is part of the Metropolitan Miami complex in the central business district of Downtown Miami, Florida. It was completed in 2010 and is one of the top twenty tallest buildings in Miami.

The Wells Fargo Center is adjacent to the JW Marriott Marquis Miami, a 31-story, 367-foot (112Â m) building which is occupied by a JW Marriott Hotel building. The two structures are connected to each other via a parking garage.

The Metropolitan Miami project gained attention due to NBA star Shaquille O'Neal's involvement in the project. In 2006, he formed the O'Neal Group, a building-development company. The Metropolitan Miami project was the group's first project.
