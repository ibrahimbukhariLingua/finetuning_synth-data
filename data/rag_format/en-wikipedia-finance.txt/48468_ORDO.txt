# ORDO



***ORDO — Jahrbuch für die Ordnung von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft*** (English: *The Ordo Yearbook of Economic and Social Order*, most commonly referred to as *Ordo Yearbook*, or simply as *ORDO*) is a peer-reviewed academic journal established in 1948 by German economists Walter Eucken and Franz Böhm. The journal focuses on the economic and political institutions governing modern society.


## History

The term ordoliberalism was coined echoing the journal's title. Furthermore, the concept of social market economy, being the main economic model used in Western and Northern Europe during and after the Cold War era, has been developed nearly exclusively within *ORDO*.

Today, the journal's mission is to provide a forum of debate for scholars of diverse disciplines such as economics, law, political science, sociology, and philosophy. *ORDO* is published annually. Articles are published either in German or in English. *ORDO* also contains book reviews.
