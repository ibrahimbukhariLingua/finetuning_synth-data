AlertMe


# AlertMe



**AlertMe** was a UK smart Tech company that provides energy and home monitoring hardware and services. AlertMe produces hardware and software to enable users to monitor and control their home energy use.

In 2015 the company was acquired by British Gas Trading Limited for Â£65 million. In April 2016 the limited company was renamed to Centrica Connected Home Limited.

AlertMe used Non Intrusive Load Monitoring to extrapolate trends from customer data, which was then used to make energy saving recommendations.


## Hardware

The AlertMe platform was based on a home hub that connected to cloud servers provided by Amazon Web Services via the home broadband router. The hub communicated via Zigbee to devices in the home, both AlertMe devices and third party enabled devices.


## Software

The AlertMe platform was open and expandable to allow users to add new devices and applications to their personal dashboard or smartphone app. Core applications included electricity monitoring (SmartEnergy), remote heating control (SmartHeating) and home monitoring (SmartMonitoring), but the platform was designed to be extendable.


## Partnerships

AlertMe had strategic partnerships with British Gas in the UK and Lowe's in the USA.
British Gas is the largest domestic energy provider in the UK serving 10 million homes and 15.9 million energy accounts.
Lowe's is the second largest home improvement retailer in the world with 15 million consumers visiting its 1725 stores every week.
