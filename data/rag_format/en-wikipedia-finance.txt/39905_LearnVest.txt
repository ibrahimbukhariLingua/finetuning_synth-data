# LearnVest



**LearnVest** was an American financial planning company founded by CEO Alexa von Tobel. It sold personal finance software.


## History

Alexa von Tobel entered Harvard Business School in the fall of 2008, but took a leave of absence and launched LearnVest. Her inspiration for LearnVest started while she was a senior at Harvard University in 2006.

LearnVest's headquarters are in New York, and they have an Expert Hub in Phoenix. LearnVest was selected as a TechCrunch50 2009 Company and debuted in September 2009 at the TechCrunch50 conference in San Francisco.

On March 25, 2015, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., based in Milwaukee, announced it would acquire LearnVest. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. LearnVest will continue to operate as a separate unit under founder and Chief Executive von Tobel. The deal has been viewed as the latest attempt by traditional financial services firms to adapt to new digital technologies. Northwestern Mutual expects the technology will encourage more adviser-client interaction and ultimately create a more rewarding experience for the customer and adviser. By adding LearnVest’s technology to the insurer’s existing planning platform, those advisers can devote more time to working with customers on carrying out their recommendations. The arrangement also puts customers in more frequent contact with those advisers.

On May 3, 2018, LearnVest discontinued its financial planning offering for consumers, as well as its LearnVest@Work program for businesses.
