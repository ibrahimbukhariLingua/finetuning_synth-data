Small Business first became a separate portfolio in the Unsworth ministry, with the appointment of Deirdre Grusovin who also held the portfolio of Consumer Affairs. In addition to the Office of Small Business, the portfolio was responsible for Small Business Development Corporation which undertook research and investigated matters relating to the small business section of the economy and aimed at expanding the effectiveness of existing government assistance and advisory programs. The portfolio was replaced in the first Grieiner ministry by the portfolio of Business and Consumer Affairs.
