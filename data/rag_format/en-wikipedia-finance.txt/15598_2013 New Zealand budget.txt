# 2013 New Zealand budget



The **New Zealand budget** for fiscal year 2013/14 was presented to the New Zealand House of Representatives by Finance Minister Bill English on 16 May 2013. This was the fifth budget English has presented as Minister of Finance.


## Outline

Budget 2013 "progressed the Government's programme while on track to surplus":

* Forecast economic growth to average between 2 and 3% a year to 2017;
* $100 million per annum on "internationally focused growth and innovation package to boost investment in science, research and development, and tourism."
* $1.5 billion additional of investments from the Future Investment Fund to spend proceeds from the Government's Mixed Ownership Model:
 + $426 million for the redevelopment of Christchurch and Burwood Hospitals. As announced previously, this will be the single biggest hospital investment in New Zealand's history.
 + $50 million to speed up the School Network Upgrade Project, which will see state school local area networks (LAN) upgraded to handle increased digital technology usage and the arrival of fibre optic internet access.
 + $94 million for the fourth year of KiwiRail's Turnaround Plan.
 + $80 million for irrigation projects, as announced previously.
 + Meridian Energy will be the next company to be partially privatised under the "mixed ownership model" plan, in the second half of 2013 pursuant to market conditions.
 + Legislation will be introduced to improve housing affordability by delivering flexible regulatory tools to councils under accords between the Government and councils in areas where housing is least affordable.
 + A memorandum of understanding with the Reserve Bank Governor confirms a range of measures, if required, to protect the economy from periods of excessive growth in credit and asset prices, and to promote financial system stability.
 + A number of revenue measures, including a proposal to allow loss-making start-up companies to claim tax losses on research and development.
* Cuts to Accident Compensation Corporation levies on households and businesses of $300 million in 2014/15, increasing to $1 billion in 2015/16;
* Provides significant extra money to help low-income families through a number of targeted initiatives.
* $5.1 billion of new operating spending in the current year and over the next four years for initiatives across areas such as health, education, welfare, and housing.
* $2.1 billion additional to help rebuild Christchurch, taking the Government's total share of the rebuild to around $15 billion.

(All figures for four years to 2016/17 unless otherwise stated).

The 2013 budget re-iterated the Government's targets – returning to surplus by 2014/15 and bringing net government debt back down to 20% of GDP by 2020:

* Forecasts show an operating surplus before gains and losses of $75 million in 2014/15 – compared to the record $18.4 billion deficit in 2010/11.
* Net core Crown debt is forecast to peak at 28.7% of GDP in 2014/15, before falling to 17.6% of GDP by 2020/21.
* Core Crown expenses are expected to drop below 31% of GDP by 2014/15, down from 35% of GDP two years ago.

Budget 2013 confirmed the Government's decisions to cap and reduce debt:

* The operating allowance is $900 million in Budget 2013, compared with $800 million signalled previously, and $1 billion in Budget 2014, compared with $1.2 billion signalled previously. From 2015 onwards, operating allowances will grow by 2% per Budget.
* The Government intends to delay contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund until net core Crown debt is no higher than 20% of GDP. This is expected in 2020/21.

## Reactions

Business New Zealand welcomed the budget, but also added that it wanted to see "bolder reform in the areas such as retirement savings and age of eligibility for superannuation and interest-free student loans." President of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Helen Kelly said the budget "has not addressed the big issues" and said the budget did nothing to "support struggling families; it does not do enough to alleviate our shocking child poverty and continues to prioritise short-term debt reduction over creating jobs and fairness."
