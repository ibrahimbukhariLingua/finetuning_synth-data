He was succeeded in 1808 by William Coulter as Lord Provost. His term of office saw various extensions agreed to the Second New Town including areas around Calton Hill such as Regent Terrace and Royal Terrace.

In 1831 the bank merged with Thomas Kinnear & Son to form **Kinnear, Smiths & Co**. However the bank closed with huge debts in 1834 due to poor speculation by Donald's brother, James Smith, in London. The assets and partial liabilities were taken over by the Bank of Scotland and British Linen Bank.

Smith's daughter Barbara Smith married Rev Dr James Peddie of the Bristo Chapel in Edinburgh and had nine children including William Peddie.
