**Carlos Manuel Bremer Gutiérrez** (1 June 1960 – 5 January 2024) was a Mexican businessman, partner of the conglomerate Grupo Financiero Value, and general director until his death and philanthropist who participated in international foundations and received some national recognitions.


## Early life

Bremer was the son of Guillermo Bremer and Sarita Gutiérrez, the fourth of their five children. He had three older brothers, Guillermo, Rodrigo, Bernardo, and a younger brother, Alberto. Bremer's grandfather, Eduardo Bremer, was a German migrant doctor who settled in Matamoros and Brownsville to dedicate himself to the pharmacy business. Bremer studied public accounting at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. In 1986, while in Monterrey, he opened 'Botica del León', one of the family's first steps into the business world. His father, following the paths of his grandfather, opened the Casa Bremer.


## Business career

Bremer began his career in the family business, Casa Bremer, which offered diverse ranges of products, from ice cream to sporting goods and pharmaceuticals. At age 12, he began selling pocket calculators to businessmen who were friends of his parents. He acquired these calculators at a cost of 10 or 11 dollars in the United States and resold them in Mexico for 18 dollars. At the age of 14, he started his first significant business organizing trips to Disneyland with his schoolmates. He generated profitability through negotiations with parents and travel agencies. Motivated by the success and profitability of arcades in the United States, Bremer saved money to open his own video game business. However, he faced failure due to the limited ability of the children in his neighborhood. Although he closed the business, he considers this experience crucial, marking him forever with the lesson of always having a contingency plan. Bremer's interest in the financial markets was so strong that by the age of 15 he was already providing investment advice to businessmen friends of his father.

At the age of 19, in September 1979, Bremer joined the Banpaís group brokerage house, which had plans to close operations in December of the same year. Before turning 20, as an investment advisor, he already had 25 clients from whom he charged commissions based on the profits obtained on their investments. Thanks to Bremer's ability to attract customers, the bank not only avoided closure, but recovered and became the city's undisputed leader. In 1985, together with businessman Jorge Lankenau, he founded the Ábaco brokerage house, which was affected by the economic crisis of 1988, leading it to bankruptcy.

In 1993, Bremer founded Grupo Financiero Value, together with Javier Benítez Gómez, a stock brokerage company that brings together Value Casa de Bolsa, Fina Arrenda and Fina Factor. In 2010, he became president of the Board of Directors, which in 2024 was replaced by José Kaún Nader.


## Philanthropy

Bremer organized and supported, with his personal initiative, various philanthropy events in Mexico with the strategy of supporting education through sports. He thus promoted events and conferences on entrepreneurship, finance, business, sports and entertainment, in order to transmit values and discipline. He defined himself as a soldier of education and sports.
