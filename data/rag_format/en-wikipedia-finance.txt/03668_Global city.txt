Global city


# Global city



A **global city** is a city that serves as a primary node in the global economic network. The concept originates from geography and urban studies, based on the thesis that globalization has created a hierarchy of strategic geographic locations with varying degrees of influence over finance, trade, and culture worldwide. The global city represents the most complex and significant hub within the international system, characterized by links binding it to other cities that have direct, tangible effects on global socioeconomic affairs.

The criteria of a global city vary depending on the source. Common features include a high degree of urban development, a large population, the presence of major multinational companies, a significant and globalized financial sector, a well-developed and internationally linked transportation infrastructure, local or national economic dominance, high quality educational and research institutions, and a globally influential output of ideas, innovations, or cultural products. Quintessential examples, based on most indices and research, include New York City, London, Paris, and Tokyo.


## Origin and terminology

The term 'global city' was popularized by sociologist Saskia Sassen in her 1991 book, *The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo*. Before then, other terms were used for urban centers with roughly the same features. The term 'world city', meaning a city heavily involved in global trade, appeared in a May 1886 description of Liverpool, by *The Illustrated London News*; British sociologist and geographer Patrick Geddes used the term in 1915. The term 'megacity' entered common use in the late 19th or early 20th century, the earliest known example being a publication by the University of Texas in 1904. In the 21st century, the terms are usually focused on a city's financial power and high technology infrastructure.


## Criteria

Competing groups have devised competing means to classify and rank world cities and to distinguish them from other cities. Although there is a consensus on the leading world cities, the chosen criteria affect which other cities are included. Selection criteria may be based on a yardstick value (e.g., if the producer-service sector is the largest sector then city X is a world city) or on an imminent determination (if the producer-service sector of city X is greater than the combined producer-service sectors of N other cities then city X is a world city.) Although criteria are variable and fluid, typical characteristics of world cities include:

* The most prominent criterion has been providing a variety of international financial services, notably in finance, insurance, real estate, banking, accountancy, and marketing; and their amalgamation of financial headquarters, a stock exchange, and other major financial institutions,
* Headquarters of numerous multinational corporations,
* Domination of the trade and economy of a large surrounding area,
* Major manufacturing centers with port and container facilities,
* Considerable decision-making power daily and at a global level,
* Centers of new ideas and innovation in business, economics, and culture,
* Centers of digital and other media and communications for global networks,
* The dominance of the national region with great international significance,
* The high percentage of residents employed in the services sector and information sector,
* High-quality educational institutions, including renowned universities and research facilities; and attracting international student attendance,
* Multi-functional infrastructure offering some of the best legal, medical, and entertainment facilities in the country,
* High diversity in language, culture, religion, and ideologies.

Smith, they create the GaWC's biennial categorization of world cities into "Alpha", "Beta" and "Gamma" tiers. The three tiers are further divided into subgroupings using plus and minus signs. The categorization is based upon the author's views of "international connectedness", primarily shown through a regions advanced services firms, such as in accountancy, finance and law).
