# Anti-Money Laundering Office, Executive Yuan



**Anti-Money Laundering Office, Executive Yuan** (**AMLO**; traditional Chinese: 行政院洗錢防制辦公室; simplified Chinese: 行政院洗钱防制办公室; pinyin: *Xíngzhèng Yuàn Xǐqián Fángzhì Bàngōngshì*) is an agency of the Government of the Republic of China to deal with money laundering matters in Executive Yuan.


## History

The office was established on 16 March 2017, five years after the second round of an Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering performance review stated that Taiwan's existing laws regarding money laundering did not conform to international standards. Premier Lin Chuan stated at the opening ceremony that the office will help build a more transparent and orderly financial environment in Taiwan. Deputy Minister of Justice Tsai Pi-chung was appointed as the office's first director.
