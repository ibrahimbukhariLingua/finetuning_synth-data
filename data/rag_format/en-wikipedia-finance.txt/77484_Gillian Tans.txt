## Career

When Tans joined Booking.com in 2002, the company had a small footprint in Amsterdam, and eventually opened up a second office in Barcelona. She was quoted, “In the past, I'd often visit Barcelona and Berlin, as our first office outside of Amsterdam HQ was in Barcelona. Here our entire team worked in an apartment building. I actually created a bedroom within the office, as we were still signing up partners to be sold on Booking.com, so we were very conscious about what we spent. I visited this office for one week every month to get our business started in Spain.”

During her tenure, Booking.com has expanded to more than 10,000 employees in 174 offices worldwide.

Before joining Booking.com, Tans spent four years with the international Golden Tulip Worldwide hotel group, where she served as Product Manager, Marketing Manager and Director of Sales. She also worked for the Intercontinental Hotel Group and with several independent hotels.
