Approved Publication Arrangement


# Approved Publication Arrangement



An **Approved Publication Arrangement (APA)** is an entity authorized under the MiFID II directive to publish trade reports on behalf of investment firms, fulfilling requirements outlined in Article (4)(1)(52). These reports contribute to increased transparency in over-the-counter (OTC) markets by disseminating both pre-trade quotes and post-trade transaction data. The MiFID II directive, which came into force in January 2018, mandates the use of APAs to enhance transparency in OTC markets.

While the term APA technically refers to the organization itself, it is also commonly used to refer to the data they publish.


## Background

APAs, Approved Reporting Mechanisms and Consolidated Tape Providers are new categories of Data Reporting Services Providers (DRSPs) that did not exist under MiFID I.

For the *APA data*, one distinguishes three asset classes: bonds, derivatives of all kind (interest rate/Credit/FX/Commodity/Equity), and Structured Finance. Each APA data record contains information such as

1. **Agreement Time and Date** in the variable `TRADING_DATE_AND_TIME` in ISO 8601 format, e.g. `2019-08-08T03:14:15.926000+00:00`
2. Publication Time
3. ISIN to uniquely identify the financial instrument (if `INSTRUMENT_ID_TYPE` is set to `ISIN`), for instance `INSTRUMENT_ID=HU0000403118` refers to a government bond of Hungary with maturity date 2027-10-27.
4. Name of the financial instrument
5. Price (and currency)
6. Volume
7. Trade type (`INSTRUMENT_ID_TYPE`)
