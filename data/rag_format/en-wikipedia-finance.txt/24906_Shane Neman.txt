## Entrepreneurship

JoonBug

In the early 2000s, before social media platforms like Facebook or tools like Eventbrite existed, Shane Neman founded JoonBug, a software-driven events company that disrupted the traditional hospitality industry. Joonbug was at the forefront of innovation, introducing technologies such as online photo purchasing, social sharing, and location-specific email newsletters, as well as one of the first digital ticketing systems. Neman transformed JoonBug into a multimillion-dollar operation, producing over 300 large-scale events annually with more than 100,000 attendees. By integrating tech into a traditionally offline industry, Joonbug reached over $25 million in annual revenue before being sold to a competitor.

EZ Texting

In 2006, recognizing the declining effectiveness of email marketing, Shane Neman launched EZ Texting, a web-based SMS marketing platform designed to offer businesses direct, efficient communication with consumers. EZ Texting was one of the first platforms to enable businesses to send bulk text messages, alerts, and appointment reminders, helping companies across industries like retail, hospitality, and healthcare increase customer engagement.

The platform rapidly became one of the largest business SMS services in the United States. Neman grew EZ Texting to seven-figure annual revenues, with a customer base of over 50,000 businesses, leading to its acquisition by CallFire in 2013. Following the acquisition, Neman took on key leadership roles, including Chief Product Officer and Director of Corporate Development, where he spearheaded mergers and acquisitions.
