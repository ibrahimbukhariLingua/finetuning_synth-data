## Controversy

His role as a member of Phorm's board was claimed to conflict with his work as a taxpayer-funded advisor on UK internet policy for BERR during the publication of the Digital Britain strategy.

At the same time, the UK Government faced European Commission infraction proceedings, following the covert trials of Phorm's technology by British Telecom in 2006 and 2007.
