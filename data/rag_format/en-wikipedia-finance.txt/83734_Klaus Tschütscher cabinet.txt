The **Klaus Tschütscher cabinet** was the governing body of Liechtenstein from 25 March 2008 to 27 March 2013. It was appointed by regent Alois on behalf of Hans-Adam II and chaired by Klaus Tschütscher


## History

The 2009 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a win for the Patriotic Union. As a result, the Second Otmar Hasler cabinet was dissolved and succeeded by Klaus Tschütscher as Prime Minister of Liechtenstein. The Patriotic Union and Progressive Citizens' Party once again entered into a coalition government.

The government's term in office was marked by an effort to move the country away from being a tax haven. It also included the passing of a same-sex registered partnership and Liechtenstein joining the Schengen Area in 2011.

Tschütscher did not stand for re-election in the 2013 Liechtenstein general election and was succeeded by Adrian Hasler in the First Adrian Hasler cabinet on 27 March 2013.
