43rd government of Turkey


# 43rd government of Turkey



The **43rd government of Turkey** (12 November 1979 – 12 September 1980) was a minority government led by Süleyman Demirel of Justice Party (AP).


## The elections

The 42nd government of Turkey came to an end because of the defeat of Bülent Ecevit's CHP in by-elections. However, CHP was still the largest party in the parliament, and Süleyman Demirel could not found a coalition government. Instead, he asked for the support of the other parties, which were reluctant to participate in the government. Finally, Necmettin Erbakan of the National Salvation Party agreed to support the minority government of AP.
