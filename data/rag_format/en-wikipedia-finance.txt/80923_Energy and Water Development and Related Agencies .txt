Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015


# Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015



The **Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015** (H.R.Â 4923) is a bill that would make appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015. The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is only $50 million less than these agencies currently receive. The appropriations for the United States Department of Energy and the United States Army Corps of Engineers are made by this bill.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.


## Background

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The *fiscal year* is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill.

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law..." This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.

The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. The bill covers appropriations for the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers (Civil), as well as for a variety of related agencies. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.

In 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013 when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation.

## Procedural history

The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 20, 2014 by Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID). It was reported by the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The House was scheduled to debate the bill during the week of July 7, 2014, considering the bill under an open rule that allowed the submission of unlimited amendments. Morning debate was canceled on July 10 due to an asbestos leak on the House side of the United States Capitol building.

On July 9, 2014, President Barack Obama threatened to veto the bill.


## Debate and discussion

President Barack Obama threatened to veto the bill, arguing that "the bill includes objectionable environmental riders that would prevent the use of funds to address known deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations that protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic development."

Some riders on the bill relate to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. For example, the Army Corps of Engineers would be prevented from finalizing a rule regarding "fill material", the waste from mountaintop mining.
