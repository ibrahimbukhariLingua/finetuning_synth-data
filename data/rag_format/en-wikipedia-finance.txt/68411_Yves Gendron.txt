# Yves Gendron



**Yves Gendron** is a Canadian accounting academic at Laval University in Quebec. He is a qualitative researcher, largely known for his studies in corporate governance, social accountability of auditors, and professional legitimacy. He is co-editor-in-chief of *Critical Perspectives on Accounting*.


## Education

Gendron began his university studies in 1982 at Université du Québec where he obtained, in 1985, his Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with a specialization in accounting. He became a CA in 1987. Post-certification, he spent most of 1992 completing propaedeutic courses at Laval University in order to meet the requirements of admission to the PhD program. He completed his PhD in Science Administration at Laval University from 1993 to 1997. His thesis was dedicated to the decision of accepting new clients in audit firms as a result of a compromise between logics of action. Although his thesis was mainly audit-focused, it also addressed professional concerns in relation to the application of accounting standards. Gendron then completed post-doctoral studies at the University of Alberta in 1998.


## Career

Prior to entering academia, Gendron worked as an auditor for Samson Bélair and Deloitte & Touche in Rimouski. Following his PhD, he joined the faculty of the University of Alberta, serving there from 1998 to 2006. Gendron then moved to Laval University, becoming full professor in 2008.

Gendron became co-editor-in-chief of the peer-reviewed accounting journal *Critical Perspectives on Accounting* in January 2014, and is an editor and editorial board member of several other accounting journals.


## Research

Gendron does qualitative research that examines the daily lives of auditors, focusing on how they make decisions or how they handle stress. His work also looks at the legitimization processes that surround public accountants’ claims to expertise, particularly in emerging fields of practice such as performance measurement, online auditing, and consulting.

Gendron has also studied:

* Corporate governance, focusing on the role of audit committees and compensation committees
* The relationship between research and practice
* The emergence of interpretive accounting research
* Performativity pressures in academia
