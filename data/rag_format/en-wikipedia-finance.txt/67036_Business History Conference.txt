Business History Conference


# Business History Conference



The **Business History Conference** (BHC) is an academic organization that supports all aspects of research, writing, and teaching about business history and about the environment in which businesses operate. Founded in 1954, the BHC supports ongoing research among its members and holds conferences to bring together business and economic historians. It also publishes a quarterly academic journal, *Enterprise & Society*, along with selected papers from its annual meetings via *BEH On-Line*.


## History

The BHC was founded in 1954 as a series of meetings held at Northwestern University. Richard C. Overton, an American railroad historian, was the first president of the BHC. As cliometricians began dominating economic historian with quantitative methods, other scholars sought to retain the atheoretical, qualitative take on scholarship. The group of economic and business historians met again in 1956, 1958, and 1971, transforming itself into a full professional organization. According to Naomi Lamoreaux of Yale University, the BHC today is composed mainly of historians, while the Economic History Association of economists.

Today, approximately 30 percent of its membership resides outside North America. This reflects the increasingly global nature of the work of business history.
