## History

*MPS Banca per l'Impresa* was a merger of the two subsidiaries of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena: MPS Merchant and *MPS Banca Verde* (ex-Istituto Federale di Credito Agrario per la Toscana or Istituto Nazionale di Credito Agrario S.p.A. (INCA)) in 2004. The history of MPS Merchant – Banca per Piccole e Medie Imprese (found 2001) could be traced back to Mediocredito Toscano, found 1954. In 2007 the bank received a division of MPS Finance and renamed into *MPS Capital Services Banca per le Imprese*.


### Mediocredito Toscano

*Mediocredito Toscano* was a bank established in 1954 to provide medium term loan to small and medium companies of Tuscany region, as a statutory corporation. 18 other Mediocredito were also established in the 1950s for the 19 regions of Italy. Due to legal changes from the Legge Amato the bank became a limited company (Italian: *Società per Azioni*), which Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) owned 74% stake. The Mediocredito also merged with *Istituto Nazionale di Credito per il Lavoro Italiano all'Estero S.p.A.* that year.

In 1995 MPS also became a limited company (formation of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena). In 2000 the Mediocredito was owned by Banca MPS (80.454% stake) and *Banca Toscana* (11.676% stake), a subsidiary of Banca MPS (57.278% stake plus 4.983% via Banca Agricola Mantovana (BAM); Banca MPS owned 51.487% stake of BAM). The two banks (BAM and Banca Toscana) were absorbed by Banca MPS in the 2000s.
