## History

In 1993, Euro Foods (UK) was founded by Shelim Hussain. It has food processing units in Newport, Barking and Sunderland. It has a plant and four factories in Bangladesh, and a subsidiary in New York City. It has three factories abroad and a site in the centre of Birmingham to produce ready meals. In 2009, the company spent £650,000 on a new warehouse. The company has opened five Asian food stores in Wales – called Masala Bazaar.

In 2012, to support the continued growth of the company, it acquired a site in Hayes, west London and a second centre in Wolverhampton after another business went into administration. The pair of sites cost the company a total of just more than £5m. A further depot was also acquired on lease in Wolverhampton to better service the group's customers in the Midlands region. In April 2014, the company bought packaging firm Brown Bear Food.


## Performance

Euro Foods made £100m worth of cost savings ahead of the economic downturn during the 2008 recession, during which sales increased.

It employs around 200 people in Wales, 280 in England and nearly 2,000 employees across the world. The firm markets predominantly Asian cuisine and in 2010 embarked upon a retail development plan.
