# Moore Global



**Moore Global** (officially **Moore Global Network Limited**) is a global accountancy, advisory and consulting network of independent firms with its headquarters in London. Moore Global is ranked by the International Accounting Bulletin (IAB) as the 11th largest accountancy network in the world. The Moore Global Network consists of over 37,000 people across 116 countries.


## History

The Moore Global network traces its origins back to a small auditing, tax consulting and insolvency practice set up by Harold Moore and Albert Partridge in 1907. **Moore, Partridge & Co** occupied a building not far from the Guildhall in the heart of the City of London, evolving steadily until the outbreak of war in 1914. By the end of the conflict, Albert Partridge had left and the business entered a new phase of growth.

In 1918 Harold Moore formed **Moore, Stephens & Co** with John Robinson Stephens, who had managed the firm while his new business partner served in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War. The name was shortened to **Moore Stephens** in 1986, then evolved again when the global network rebranded as **Moore** in 2019.

In 1921, the firm opened an office in Glasgow and established Moore, Cross & Co. in Brazil a year later. Shortly afterwards, the firm started to develop close relations with the Greek shipping community, which continue to this day. The initial international push revolved the need to meet specific shipping client requirements. Over time, these offices diversified to offer services to a wide range of industries.

In 1968 the Moore Stephens International network was formally established and by 1979 there were member firms in most of the world’s main economies.

A third generation of the Moore family, Richard, took on the task of developing the network, becoming chairman of Moore Stephens International in 2004. He stepped down at the end of 2019, having seen through the successful transition to the **Moore Global network** in 2019.
