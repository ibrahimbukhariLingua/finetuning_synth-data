## Global and regional forum events

The EMF commissions policy experts to write background papers, which provide a starting point for forum discussions. Participants come from both the private and public sectors to engage in open dialogue and implement solutions that will benefit emerging market economies.

Past events have taken place in Jakarta, Vietnam, Mumbai, Hanoi, Bogota, Montevideo, Oxford, Switzerland, Morocco, South Africa, and other locations.
