# Factorial (software company)



**Factorial** is a technology company that provides human resources software as a service. Founded in 2016 by Jordi Romero, Bernat Farrero, and Pau Ramon Revilla, the company has offices in Barcelona, Miami, São Paulo, and Mexico City.

Factorial's software includes Absence management features, a Document management system, and built-in analytics.


## History

Factorial was founded in 2016. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Factorial made its software available for free for a period of time while restrictions were in place. This led to new interest from companies that had never used cloud-based services before, and had previously only used manual methods for document management and other HR processes.

Factorial received a Series B investment round of $80 million, followed by a Series C investment round of $120 million in 2022, raising the company's valuation to $1 billion and granting it unicorn status.


### Mexico City Office

Factorial opened its Mexico City office in June, 2021.


### Miami Office

In 2023, Factorial opened its office in Miami. The choice of location in North America was part of the process of expanding in the US and Canadian markets with products that are localized for these markets. The office is located in the Latitude One office building in Brickell.


## Software

The software is made up of a section for time off management with a team calendar where all absences and upcoming days off are collected and shared with the team, an employee self-service area which is a custom portal where employees can update their personal information, documents, holidays, documents, and events, and a separate dashboard for talent management.
