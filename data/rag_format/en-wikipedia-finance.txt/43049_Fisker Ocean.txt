Fisker Ocean


# Fisker Ocean



The **Fisker Ocean** is a battery electric mid-size crossover SUV that was manufactured and marketed by Fisker, which filed for bankruptcy protection in June of 2024. Released in 2023, the Ocean was intended to be the first of three models in a lineup of mass-market all-electric vehicles designed by Henrik Fisker.


## Overview

On October 15, 2020, Fisker announced it would outsource production of the Ocean to Magna Steyr, an Austrian-based contract manufacturer, in order to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Fisker utilised Magna's electric vehicle platform, and gave Magna a stake of up to 6% of Fisker equity. In June 2021, Fisker finalised its manufacturing deal with Magna Steyr, with production on the Fisker Ocean to begin in November 2022 at Magna's facility in Graz, Austria.

In November 2021, Fisker and Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) announced a deal for CATL to supply two different battery packs for the Fisker Ocean SUV. The primary high-capacity pack uses a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide cell chemistry, and the second pack uses CATL's cells based on lithium iron phosphate chemistry.

The Fisker Ocean was presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2022.

On June 1, 2023, the Ocean Extreme was reported to achieve an EPA range of 360 miles (579 km). It was offered in both front and all-wheel drive.

The Ocean has experienced more than 100 loss-of-power incidents as well as other technical problems after delivery, resulting in three National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigations into different issues and multiple recalls.

In March 2024, due to the financial difficulties faced by Fisker Inc, production of the Ocean was paused for six weeks in order for the company to "align inventory levels and progress strategic and financing initiatives.” The company warned that bankruptcy was imminent and could occur within weeks. In June 2024, the company announced it had filed for bankruptcy and was indefinitely suspending production of the Ocean.


## Pre-orders

In October 2020, Viggo, a newly founded Danish ride-hailing service, ordered 300 Fisker Oceans, to be delivered in late 2022. In March 2021, Fisker announced an agreement with Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance (of Crédit Agricole Group) on the potential supply of Fisker Ocean SUVs to the European banking group. In May 2021, Fisker announced an agreement with UK electric car subscription service Onto to supply the company with up to 700 Fisker Ocean SUVs in 2023.

As of February 2022, the company announced that it has over 30,000 reservations for the Fisker Ocean SUV and over 55,000 by August 2022. At the end of 2022, the Ocean had 63,000 preorders.


## Deliveries

Fisker delivered its first Ocean One customer vehicle on May 5, 2023, in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Fisker made its first deliveries to customers in the United States with the delivery of 22 Oceans on June 23, 2023.

Only 10,000 were built, with less than half delivered.
