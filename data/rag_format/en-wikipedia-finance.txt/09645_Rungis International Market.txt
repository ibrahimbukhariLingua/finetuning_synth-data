Rungis International Market


# Rungis International Market



The **Rungis International Market** (French: *Marché International de Rungis*, pronounced [maʁʃe ɛ̃tɛʁnɑsjɔnal də ʁœ̃ʒis]) is the principal wholesale market of Paris and mainly deals in food and horticultural products. It is located in the commune of Rungis, in the southern suburbs. It is the second largest wholesale food market in the world (after Central de Abasto in Mexico City, which has an area of 327 hectares (810 acres)).


## History

From its origins in the 10th century to the mid-20th century, the central market of Paris was located in the centre of the city, in a 10-hectare (25-acre) area named Les Halles. That became too small to accommodate all of the business demand, and, in 1969, the market was transferred to the suburbs. Rungis was selected because of its easy access by rail and highway and its proximity to Orly International Airport.

On 25 September 2022, the market caught fire.


## Ownership

The market is the property of the French State and administered by the Semmaris (*Société d'Economie Mixte d'Aménagement et de gestion du marché d'intérêt national de Rungis*).
