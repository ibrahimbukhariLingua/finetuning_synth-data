From 1990 to 1992, as deputy director of the economic advisers of the Prime Minister, he prepared the first Belgian convergence programme designed to introduce the euro. In 1993, he was appointed director of the Federal Planning Bureau by the Government and took part in the group of experts designated by the Government to prepare the Social Pact that would lead the government to adopt the "Global Plan for employment, competitiveness and social security" which aimed to restore the Belgian economy after the sharp crisis in 1993. Henri Bogaert has also been member and chairman of the European Economic Policy Committee as well as, from 2000 to 2010, Chairman of the Working Group on ageing of population and fiscal sustainability.
