Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)


# Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)



**Trianon** is a 45-storey, 186 m (610 ft) skyscraper in the Westend-Süd district of Frankfurt, Germany, completed in 1993. For several decades until 2024, it served as the headquarters for DekaBank; other tenants are Deutsche Bundesbank (since 2015) and Franklin Templeton. Atop the building is an inverted pyramid suspended from the three corners. As of 2023, the tower is the eighth-tallest skyscraper in Frankfurt and also in Germany.

The Trianon's layout is roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, the corners of which are formed by three-sided towers. The end is an inverted three-sided pyramid on the roof. It is the first structure in Germany to use high-strength concrete.


## Ownership

In 2007, DekaBank sold the building to the Morgan Stanley European Office Fund (MSEOF). A 57% interest in the building was later transferred to the real estate investment fund Morgan Stanley P2 Value.

In June 2015, Morgan Stanley and Madison Real Estate sold the building to the US investor NorthStar Reality Europe for the equivalent of US$540 million. In November 2018 NorthStar Reality Europe sold Trianon to the South Korean financial consortium IGIS Asset Management and Hana Financial Investment for US$758 million.

In June 2024, Trianon's owner Geschaeftshaus am Gendarmenmarkt filed for insolvency in a Frankfurt court.
