## History

Soon after the online casino was launched, Boss Media launched Casino.com as a casino news portal and the company started receiving requests from investors and companies interested in purchasing Boss Media's casino software as a white label. Boss Media's main focus thereby transferred to the creation of complete white label Internet casino solutionsᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ for clients and began to sell licenses at around 300,000 US dollars plus a revenue share.

During the years following,ʷʰᵉⁿ? Boss Media was a dominant player in the global online casino software market alongside Microgaming, CryptoLogic and later Playtech amongst others.

During the boom in US online gambling prior to its US ban in 2004, Boss Media was supporting some 32 or more licensees with its software.

Boss Media's corporate focus later shifted to the creation of customised e-gaming systems for several gaming corporations. Boss Media sold its Internet casino in February 2004 to focus entirely on the e-gaming solutions it develops for clients. Boss Media then provided e-gaming solutionsᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ for online casino operators including bwin and Sportingbet.
