## Early life and education

Born in November 1951, McWilliams was educated at Stonyhurst College and the University of Oxford, gaining his first degree in philosophy, politics and economics and then graduating with a MPhil in economics.


## Career

McWilliams became Chief Economist for IBM (UK) and then was Chief Economic Adviser to the Confederation of British Industry from 1988 to 1992. In that year, he won the *Sunday Times* Golden Guru Award for best United Kingdom economic forecaster and founded the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). He was the Gresham College Professor of Commerce in 2012–14,

McWilliams's book *The Flat White Economy* (2015) details the digital sector, which he saw as driving the British economy, and rose to first position in the Amazon Business and Law Best Seller List. His *The Inequality Paradox* (2018) argues against Thomas Piketty's conclusion that increasing economic inequality is the result of exploitation. *Driving the Silk Road* (2020) is about his experience of driving a classic Bentley S1 on the Peking to Paris Endurance Rally of 2019 and his perceptions of economic conditions in the countries of Asia and Europe he drove through.
