## Career

Aguzin joined J.P Morgan Chase in 1990 in Buenos Aires as a financial analyst. Between 1990 and 2005, he held a variety of roles in New York and Buenos Aires including Head of the Investment Banking Division in Latin America. In 2005 he was appointed as CEO of Latin America.

On 9 February 2021 HKEX announced that it had appointed Aguzin as chief executive officer, effective 24 May 2021 for a term of three years, until 23 May 2024. The appointment of a non-Chinese person as CEO of HKEX was reportedly unexpected by market observers, who noted Aguzin will have to balance the demands of authorities in Beijing with those of Hong Kong's trading community.

In December 2023, HKEX announced that Aguzin informed the board that he will not seek reappointment at the end of his contract in May 2024. His term was marked by difficulties which included regulatory crackdowns, COVID-19 pandemic and a decline in profits leading to the HKEX share price plunging 42%. Aguzin left his role two months early at the end of February 2024 and was succeeded by Bonnie Chan.
