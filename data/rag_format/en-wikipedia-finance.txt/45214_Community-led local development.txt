Community-led local development


# Community-led local development



The **community-led local development** (**CLLD**) funding approach is a European Union initiative to support the decentralised management of development projects, primarily in rural, but also in coastal and urban areas, by involving relevant local actors, including local organizations and associations, as well as individual citizens. At first it was limited to the rural areas under the name **LEADER** (the acronym standing for French: *Liaison entre actions de développement de l'économie rurale*, English: Links between actions for the development of the rural economy). The approach is regularly evaluated, and also discussed widely in academic literature on local economic and social development.


## Operation and objectives

CLLD projects are managed by local action groups (LAGs). Members of LAG may be public authorities (such as municipalities or other local or regional public bodies), public-private entities, associations, NGOs, companies, citizens and many more types of players. Decisions are taken in executive committees in which private players must have at least 51% of the votes, thus avoiding public-sector control.

Projects are implemented as part of local development strategies (LDSs), which include in-depth assessments of the area, objectives and expected results. A new LDS is developed for each programming period, allowing new challenges and opportunities to be addressed. As the LDSs present the main backbone of a LEADER area, they are (in most cases) developed in close cooperation with local and regional stakeholders, such as citizens, members of the LAG and other private or public partners (bottom-up approach). Each LDS must involve a relatively small area, with a population of between 10,000 and 100,000 inhabitants.

LEADER is funded by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) investment pillar (Pillar II) and is implemented by the Member State's CAP Strategic Plans during the 2023-2027 programming period.

In France, the whole country is eligible with the exception of urban areas with over 50,000 inhabitants. France has 140 local action groups. In Luxembourg, all of the country's rural municipalities are eligible (with one exception). Luxembourg has 5 LAGs.
