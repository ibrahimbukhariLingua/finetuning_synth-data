It was then known as the College of Administration, and was situated on Western the campus of Achimota School with the old Department of Commerce of the Kumasi College of Technology, which became the nucleus of KNUST. The School was renamed the School of Administration in 1962, and eventually, the University of Ghana Business School (UGBS) in 2004.
