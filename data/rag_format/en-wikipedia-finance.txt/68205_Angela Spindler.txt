## Career


### Early years

Spindler attended the Victoria University of Manchester and Harvard Business School.

Spindler started her career in 1983 as a graduate trainee at Cadbury Schweppes. She then moved to Pedigree Petfoods, gathering experience in sales, marketing and human resources. In 1997, she joined Asda as a unit director and climbed her way through the ranks until November 2005, when she became managing director of George Clothing, Asda's clothing department that is stocked in Asda's and Walmart's in several countries worldwide.


### Debenhams

Spindler left her role at George Clothing in August 2007, to become managing director of Debenhams, a high street clothing retailer in the UK, with franchises around the world. She left this role in January 2009, to take an opportunity that she described as “simply too good to miss", which was joining the Factory Shop Group.


### The Factory Shop Group Limited

Spindler is the former CEO of The Factory Shop Group Limited

Whilst at the Factory Shop, Spindler oversaw a large expansion scheme and increased sales and profitability. In September 2012, The Telegraph reported that the chain's year-on-year sales had increased almost 6% and its pre-tax profits were up 30% in the prior six months. Spindler has always attributed the chains' success to having quality products at reduced prices and opening stores in 'under-served' areas.

Spindler referred to the company as “one of retail’s best kept secrets”, and claimed she had not heard of the company prior to accepting the job. Spindler is married and resides in Yorkshire, but will be relocating to Cheshire.
