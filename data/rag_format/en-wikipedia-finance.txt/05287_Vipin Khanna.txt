## Early life and military career

Vipin Kumar Khanna was born on 14 December 1930 in Lahore, Punjab Province, British India. Khanna was born into a Punjabi family. He was the son of businessman Shanti Lal Khanna, also known as S.L. Khanna. His father Shanti Lal was also a Freemason. His brothers were Ravi and Vinod. Khanna, along with his family, fled Lahore during the partition of India in 1947, and migrated to Delhi, India. According to claims from his son, Arvind Khanna, he was from a wealthy family in Lahore, but the family lost their wealth when they fled the city during the Partition, and had to start anew after migrating to Delhi.

In 1950, Khanna was commissioned into the Indian Army after graduating from the National Defence Academy, which at the time was known as the Joint Services Wing, and was part of the Indian Military Academy, in Dehradun. He was commissioned into the Brigade of the Guards regiment. During his service in the army, Khanna was part of the Indian contingent of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), which was formed in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, and was deployed to Egypt.

During his time in the UNEF, Khanna was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General E. L. M. Burns, who was the first Force Commander of the UNEF. While serving with the United Nations (UN), he traveled extensively to foreign countries. During his travels, Khanna established connections with various individuals, which later contributed to the development of his international network in his business career.

When he returned to India, Khanna became an instructor at the College of Combat, Mhow, which is now known as the Army War College, Mhow, for three years. Khanna eventually rose to the rank of Major; however, he voluntarily retired from the Indian Army in 1965. His retirement came into effect on 17 July 1965. Khanna stated that his reasons for seeking premature retirement were that he saw no future prospects for himself within the army and that he had domestic concerns.


## Business career


### Early career

Khanna started his business career after voluntarily retiring from the Indian Army in 1965. He began his career by joining Delhi Small Scale Industries, a textile manufacturing and import-export company founded in the 1950s by his father, Shanti Lal. In 1966, Khanna and his brother, Vinod, founded Amarjyothi, a company established to receive commissions from foreign companies for business assistance in India. In 1967, Khanna and Vinod were involved in the Lok Sabha's Committee of Privileges inquiry due to allegations of using improper influence and misleading officials in business dealings related to the import of sulfur by Amarjyothi.

The parliamentary inquiry arose from concerns that Khanna and Vinod leveraged their political influence, connections within the State Trading Corporation of India, and provided inaccurate information to parliamentary officials to benefit Amarjyothi and its foreign partners. However, in 1969, the Committee of Privileges found insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations of misconduct or improper influence against both brothers, and concluded that Amarjyothi's business dealings were conducted legally and did not breach any regulations or ethical standards.


### Dynamic Sales Service International

In 1967, Khanna founded Dynamic Sales Service International (DSSI), which initially started as a commodities trading and marketing company. In 1971, the company started importing newsprint from Canada to India. In the 1970s, Khanna, through his company DSSI, also developed business relationships with companies in the United States (US). Officials from the United States Embassy in New Delhi and representatives from both the United States Department of Commerce and United States Department of State would meet and communicate with him as well. Also during the 1970s, Khanna, according to his own statements in communication documents to the United States Department of State, had developed connections within the Government of India and the Indian bureaucracy. According to the communication documents from Khanna to the US Department of State, these included connections with then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, members of various cabinet committees, and the executives of public sector undertakings (PSUs).

DSSI's commodities trading and marketing business expanded to include commodities from the metals and mining, agriculture, steel, coal, fertilizers, and oil and gas industries. The company facilitated the import of commodities from foreign multinational companies, which included Cargill, Nova Chemicals, Husky Energy and Mobil, before its merger with Exxon. These imports were primarily for PSUs and Indian government cooperatives, among which were Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, MMTC and Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative. DSSI facilitated both the import and export of commodities for companies which included BHP, Louis Dreyfus Company, Tate & Lyle, Phillips Petroleum, National Aluminium Company, Steel Authority of India and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam.

DSSI, through its engineering support division, facilitated imports from several foreign companies, including Nortel, STC, Loral Corporation, Harris Corporation, and General Electric. The company's engineering support division supplied telecommunications equipment from foreign companies to Indian government departments, and also supplied products from foreign companies to Indian Railways and the Airports Authority of India. DSSI's engineering support division collaborated with HMT to establish Indian Railways' first wheel and axle factory, developed the Oil & Natural Gas Corporation's first subsea production system in collaboration with Engineers India, and set up power plants for National Fertilizer's Bhatinda and Panipat facilities as well. The company also entered the shipbroking industry. In 1990, DSSI established DSSI Exports. DSSI Exports entered the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry and, in the 1990s, the company also manufactured and exported textiles.

By 2002, DSSI was a diversified business group, and the company's annual sales exceeded $800 million. DSSI also had offices in London and Singapore, and Khanna's youngest child, Aditya Khanna, led DSSI's international businesses, which included entering into the oil field exploration industry. DSSI also established DSSI Foods and further expanded in the FMCG industry. DSSI Foods was initially started as a brand under DSSI Exports before being set up as a company in 2004. The company sold tea products, roasted coffee beans, spices and cashews.

In 1997, Khanna entered the drinks and alcohol industries through his company Clan Morgan, which was based in Alwar, Rajasthan. The company had its distilleries and bottling plants located in Rajasthan. Clan Morgan also had a joint venture with Allied Domecq, and initially owned 50% of the joint venture. The joint venture was called Allied Domecq Spirit & Wine India. The joint venture introduced and established the whiskey brands, Teacher's and Old Smuggler in the Indian market. The company also bottled Allied Domecq's other international brands. Later, Allied Domecq increased their shareholding in the joint venture to 74%, and in 2005, bought out Clan Morgan's 26% share in Allied Domecq Spirit & Wine India.

In 2009, Khanna entered the software industry through his company V4 Security Service, which was based in Delhi.

Kaupthing Bank, which was an Icelandic bank, acquired 20% of FiNoble Advisors in 2007.

During his business career, Khanna developed various international connections. In 1985, during a visit to India, United States Senator Richard Lugar met with Khanna to examine US foreign policy in India and South Asia. From 1996 to 2005, he served as the Honorary Consul of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in New Delhi. During his tenure as Honorary Consul, Khanna supported the idea that India would benefit if Luxembourg established banks in the country. In 2006, amid an investigation into Khanna's alleged business dealings, the Indian Government asserted that he was powerful enough to influence global investigative agencies.


## Controversies


### Arms dealer allegations

Khanna and his family faced allegations of being one of the largest and most powerful arms dealers in India. Khanna was allegedly one of the three largest arms dealers in India, along with Sudhir Choudhrie and Suresh Nanda. In 2006, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) claimed that the Khanna family, the Nanda family and the Choudhrie family had been controlling business in the defence industry of India even prior to the Bofors Scandal in the 1980s, and allegedly, their commissions from defence deals were possibly as much as 15%. Before the ban on lobbying for arms deals following the Bofors Scandal in the 1980s, the Ministry of Defence maintained a list of arms agents that was reviewed annually, and Khanna's name appeared on the list every year. In 2012, the Enforcment Directorate (ED) claimed that Khanna and his family's network in the Indian defence industry grew more powerful after the Bofors Scandal.

Khanna was allegedly an influential figure in the Indian defence industry and reportedly, played an instrumental role in the approval of defence deals in India. Allegations against Khanna suggested that he could influence deals in the defence procurement process by leveraging his network within the Indian bureaucracy and allegedly paying large bribes to politicians, military officials, and bureaucrats involved in the process. Khanna was allegedly linked to various foreign defence companies and was allegedly involved in various arms deals in India. However, the allegations levelled against him were never proven, and the investigations and cases against Khanna were dropped.


#### Allegations of links to foreign defence companies

In 1986, officials from the Ministry of Finance conducted an investigation into Khanna for allegedly being an arms agent for Saab, a Swedish defence and aerospace company. However, the officials from the ministry later dropped the investigation into him. In 1987, Khanna was once again investigated by the Ministry of Finance for his alleged links to Saab, however, before the investigation could progress further, the officer in charge of the investigation was transferred. Khanna was reported in 1986 to have allegedly been the arms agent for Hughes Helicopters, an American helicopter manufacturer that became McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems in 1984 and later MD Helicopters in 1999. In 1999, it was alleged that Khanna was the arms agent for Thomson-CSF, a French defence, aerospace and electronics company that was rebranded as Thales Group in 2000. It was also alleged in 1999 that Khanna was the arms agent for British Aerospace, a British aerospace and defence company that became BAE Systems in 1999, and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, an Israeli defence and aerospace company.

In 2001, Khanna's name appeared in Operation West End, a sting operation that was organised and carried out by Tehelka, an Indian news magazine. During the sting operation, Tehelka met Lieutenant Colonel V.K. Berry, a retired Indian Army officer, and had discussions with him about middlemen in the Indian defence industry. Berry claimed that Khanna was allegedly the arms agent for several Israeli defence companies, among which were Elbit Systems, Elisra, Tadiran Communications and Symtech. Berry also claimed that he had worked for Khanna for 3 years and had met these companies during that time. Berry made a further claim that Khanna facilitated a deal in which Tadiran Communications supplied communications equipment to the Cabinet Secretariat and that Khanna received a 12% commission for facilitating the deal. However, Berry later stated that what he had said regarding the communications equipment deal was untrue, and Khanna, under oath, denied that Berry had ever worked for him.

In 2024, it was reported that in 2005, Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace manufacturer, had an agreement with a UK-based company stipulating that Khanna would receive a 9% commission on the total value of defence contracts secured from the Indian Air Force (IAF).


#### Allegations of involvement in arms deals

In 1999, it was alleged that Khanna was involved in the deal signed by the Indian government in 1996 to procure the avionics package for the MiG-21, a Soviet fighter aircraft designed by Mikoyan, a with avionics equipment manufactured by various Israeli defence and aerospace companies, for which he was allegedly the arms agent.

In 2005, Khanna was accused for allegedly facilitating the arms deal that involved the sale of 1,200 anti-material rifles from Denel, a South African aerospace and defence company, to the Indian Army. The anti-material rifles deal between Denel and India was completed in 2003. The CBI and the ED claimed that Khanna allegedly used Varas Associates, an offshore company with offices in the Isle of Man and Berne, Switzerland, to receive a commission of 12.75% for securing the order for Denel. The CBI also claimed that Khanna allegedly influenced the Price Negotiation Committee of the Ministry of Defence. The CBI and ED eventually dropped the case against Khanna due to lack of evidence.

In 2007, Khanna was accused by the CBI for being involved in the Barak Missile scandal. In 2000, the Indian Navy signed a contract to purchase seven Barak anti-missile defence systems and 200 Barak missiles from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), an Israeli defence and aerospace company. The allegations of corruption in the missile deal caused the Barak Missile scandal. During the investigations into the scandal, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Khanna in 2007 for allegedly receiving vast kickbacks for securing the contract for Israel, and the CBI also confiscated his passport. The CBI stated that Khanna was a very influential and highly connected person, who was powerful in both India and internationally. The CBI further claimed that due to these reasons, releasing Khanna's passport would adversely impact the investigation into him. It was also alleged by the CBI that Khanna had routed his payments from the deal through his various businesses and companies based in Mauritius. The case against Khanna was eventually dropped due to lack of evidence.

In 2016, the CBI launched a probe into the purchase of three airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft from Embraer. Khanna was accused of swinging the aircraft deal, which was signed in 2008, in favour of Embraer by influencing the IAF and the Defence Research Development Organization (DRDO). The first information report (FIR) filed by the CBI mentioned that Khanna used an offshore company named Interdev Aviation Services Pte Ltd, located in Singapore, to channel payments from Embraer into India to use for kickbacks. Allegedly, the payments were also routed through Austria and Switzerland. In 2023, the CBI dropped the legal proceedings against Khanna due to his death in 2019.


### Oil-for-Food scandal

In 2005, it was alleged that Khanna and his son Aditya were beneficiaries of corruption in the UN's Oil-for-Food Programme. Reportedly, Natwar Singh, the then-Minister of External Affairs and a family relative of Khanna's, received kickbacks, parts of which allegedly went to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. It was also reported that Natwar Singh allegedly helped procure oil contracts for some companies owned by Khanna and his son, Aditya. Although Khanna was investigated for the allegations, the investigations primarily focused on his son Aditya, who was later cleared of all accusations by the Pathak Inquiry Authority, which had been formed to investigate the alleged scandal.


### Alleged links to offshore companies

Between 2006 and 2007, Khanna was connected by the CBI and ED to a network of offshore companies based in London, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The CBI and ED claimed that Khanna owned numerous offshore companies, and was allegedly disguising and routing his vast commissions from defence deals through these offshore companies. Khanna denied any links to all offshore companies and financial transactions, and Gopal Subramaniam, an Additional Solicitor General of India, stated to the Supreme Court of India that both the CBI and the ED had found no material evidence linking Khanna to offshore companies and the transactions. In 2007, the CBI claimed that Khanna owned or had business interests in various companies in the UK and other countries. The CBI eventually dropped the case against Khanna due to lack of evidence.


### Securency bribery scandal

In 2007, Securency, a Reserve Bank of Australia subsidiary, was involved in bribing overseas officials so that Australia could win lucrative polymer banknote printing contracts. It was reported that David Twine, who was at the time Austrade's Asia regional director and one of Australia's senior most foreign trade promotion officials, met with Khanna to discuss work for Securency and to help the company secure government related contracts. The investigation into Securency was, at the time, Australia's largest foreign bribery scandal and investigation. It was also reported that Khanna's son, Aditya, and his company, DSSI, were hired by Securency to assist in circulating its polymer banknotes in India.
