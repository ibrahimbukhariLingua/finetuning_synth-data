**HEC Montréal** (French: *Hautes études commerciales de Montréal*; English: *High Commercial Studies of Montreal*) is a bilingual public business school located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Founded in 1907, HEC Montréal is the graduate business school of the Université de Montréal and is the first established school of management in Canada.

HEC Montréal offers undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate programs, including Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Master of Science in Administration (MSc), Master of Management (MM), Master of Business Administration (MBA), and PhD in Administration, in addition to a joint Executive MBA program with McGill University.


## History

HEC Montréal was founded in 1907 by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal. Its initial building in Viger Square is now called the Gilles Hocquart Building.

In 1988, a group of HEC students established Jeux du Commerce, where more than 1300 students from 14 universities in Eastern Canada gather annually for academic, social, and sports events. A similar competition has been established in Western Canada called JDC West.

As of 2021, the centenary of the HEC Montréal Alumni Association, the school had over 100,000 alumni.

## Buildings


### The Decelles Campus: 1970–today

In 1970, Robert Bourassa inaugurated the Decelles building of HEC Montreal, also known as "the School on the Mountain." The students sometimes use the expression "Bunker" to refer to it due to the use of concrete for the exterior façade and the absence of windows.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1976, the PhD program was proposed in collaboration with McGill University. The MSc program was created in the same year.

Under the presidency of Pierre Harvey, the 75th anniversary of the school was celebrated in 1982 with René Lévesque, then Premier of Quebec, in attendance. The 7th floor of the Decelles building was inaugurated on this occasion.

Between 2010 and 2012, the 3rd and 4th floors were renovated.


### The Côte-Sainte-Catherine Campus: 1996–today

HEC Montréal's main building was constructed in 1996 and has since won an award for "institutional architecture." The building was designed by Dan Hanganu and Jodoin, Lamarre, Pratte, and Associates and is situated at 3000 Côte-Sainte-Catherine (Map), next to the Université-de-Montréal Metro Station. The former main building at 5255 Decelles (Map) is now used as a secondary building. The first building used by HEC Montréal was located in downtown Montreal but is no longer used by the school.

The trading floor of the school was inaugurated in 1997, and it was conceived to be usable in case the Montreal Stock Exchange ever had significant engineering problems. Now known as the Salle des marchés Financière Banque Nationale, it was renovated in 2007 to remain technologically current.
