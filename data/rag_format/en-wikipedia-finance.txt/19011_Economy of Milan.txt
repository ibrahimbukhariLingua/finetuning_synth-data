## Economic history

Since the late 12th century, Milan has been a wealthy and industrious city with the production of armours and wool.
During the Renaissance, Milan was a center of production of luxury goods, textiles, hats and fabrics, along with Venice, Rome and Florence. The English word *millinery*, referring to women's hats in the 19th century, came from the word *Milan*.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
Towards the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Milan became a major European industrial centre for the automotive industry, chemicals, textiles, tools, heavy machinery and book and music publishing, with thousands of companies already headquartered in the city.
After the city's World War II bombings and the opening of the Milan camp for refugees, the city witnessed an "economic miracle", with new buildings being built (such as the Pirelli Tower), more industries opening up and hundreds of thousand of immigrants from Southern Italy migrating to the city.
Beginning in the 1980s the city experienced a strong flow of immigrants, and became a major international and cosmopolitan centre for expatriate employees.
A study showed that by the late-1990s, more than 10% of the city's workers were foreigners.
According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), 181,393 foreign-born immigrants lived in the city in January 2008, representing 13.9% of the total population.


## Production and sectors

Milan had a strong industrial and economic production after the war, however, it fell slightly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially with the tangentopoli political scandal. However, from 2004 onwards, economic growth started to increase again, with an average of 1%, below Lombardy (whose growth rate was 4.6%) and the Italy's 2004 6% average, and a significant reduced production in some industries: footwear (-11.4%), textiles (-6.1%) and clothing (-5%). The bulk of the plastic (-2%), chemicals (-1.8%) and mechanics (-1.6%) industries show a downward trend. Publishing production decreased by -2.6%, while the wood-processing industry production decreased by -1.2%. In contrast, despite an industrial decrease in production, Milan has had a rapid and strong growth in the tertiary and quaternary sectors, with logistics and transport (+6.8%) and food (+1.7%). Milan also has an important role in book production and publishing. It is the most important city in the nation for publishing.


## Banks and other services

Banks throughout Italy went through many changes in the late 1800s to early 1900s. One of the Milanese banks, the SBI, had many issues resolving its resources. It did not have support from foreign banks nor enough savings domestically. Other banks during this time in Italy, specifically during the 1907 international crisis, had high liquid assets and would have had to go bankrupt without the help from Banca d'Italia. A group of industrialists and bankers from Milan transformed the banking institute Figli di Weil Schott e C. into the Società Bancaria Milanese.

Most traditional industries have relocated to other locations other than cities or have even closed down since the late 1970s in Italy. However, Milan, became Italy's most successful postindustrial city. Milan's service sector has benefited from the efficiency of the city's banks and the stock market, the Borsa Italiana located in Piazza degli Affari in the centre of the city. The majority of the services revolve around the Fashion industry, but the city is also a world centre of design at whole.
