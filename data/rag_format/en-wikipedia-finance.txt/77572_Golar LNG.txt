# Golar LNG



**Golar LNG** owns and operates marine LNG infrastructure. The company had developed Floating LNG liquefaction terminal (FLNG) and Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) projects based on the conversion of existing LNG carriers. Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies have now been completed for a larger newbuild FLNG solution. Golar is also collaborating with another industry leader to investigate solutions for the floating production of blue and green ammonia as well as carbon reduction in LNG production.


## History

The company was founded in 1946 as **Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Company**. In 1970 the company entered the LNG segment.

In 1973, the Gotaas-Larsen oil tanker SS Golar Patricia exploded and sank off the Canary Islands. With gross register tonnage of 98,894 and deadweight tonnage of 216,326 long tons (242,285 short tons; 219,797 t), it was at the time the largest ship ever lost at sea.

The Singapore-based Osprey Maritime bought the company in 1997. In 2000 the John Fredriksen-controlled World Shipholding started a take-over of Osprey, completed in 2001 when the LNG segments of Osprey were transferred to Golar LNG. It was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 2001 and NASDAQ in 2002, 30 August 2012 it was delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange.

In June 2015, Golar LNG announced a joint venture with Stolt-Nielsen to pursue production and distribution opportunities. The latter also made a strategic investment in the former, acquiring a 2.3 percent stake.

Golar LNG Partners LP operates the world's first regasification vessel *Golar Spirit* converted from an LNG carrier.
