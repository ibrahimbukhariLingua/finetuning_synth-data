Moroccan rial


# Moroccan rial



The **rial** was the currency of Morocco between 1880 and 1921. It was subdivided into 10 *dirham*, each of 50 *mazunas*.


## History

The rial was introduced when Morocco adopted a modern style coinage in 1882. It replaced a system consisting of copper falus, silver *dirham* and gold *benduqi*.

In Spanish Morocco, the rial was replaced by the Spanish peseta in 1912 at a rate of 1 rial = 5 pesetas. In French Morocco, the rial was replaced in 1921 by the franc at a rate of 1 rial = 10 francs.


## Coins

In 1882, silver 1⁄2, 1, 21⁄2 and 5 dirham and 1 rial coins were issued whilst, in 1902, bronze 1, 2, 5 and 10 mazunas were introduced. Although there were several design changes, these denominations remained otherwise unchanged until 1921.


## Banknotes

The only paper money issued denominated in rial were issued by the State Bank of Morocco between 1910 and 1917. These were also denominated in francs, with denominations of 4 rials (40 francs) and 20 rials (200 francs).
