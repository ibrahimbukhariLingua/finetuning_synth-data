Bolsa Institucional de Valores


# Bolsa Institucional de Valores



The **Institutional Stock Exchange** (Spanish: *Bolsa Institucional de Valores*), commonly known as **BIVA**, is Mexico's second stock exchange, based in Mexico City. BIVA began operations on 25 July 2018 and trades the same instruments as the other exchange in Mexico, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores: equities, debts, warrants and some Mexican-specific instruments such as CKDs and FIBRAs.


## History

On 29 August 2017, President Enrique Peña Nieto presented Santiago Urquiza Luna Parra, president of BIVA's parent company Cencor, with the concession to open and operate a new stock exchange in Mexico, the Bolsa Institucional de Valores (BIVA). The concession itself was published the same day in the *Diario Oficial de la Federación*.

The stock exchange commenced operations on 25 July 2018, ending the 43-year monopoly of the BMV in the Mexican stock exchange market. The exchange's first opening bell was rung in a ceremony at the Altar de la Patria in Mexico City.
