Jordan Investment Commission


# Jordan Investment Commission



**Jordan Investment Commission** (JIC), previously **Jordan Investment Board**, is the national investment promotion agency of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.


## History

The Jordan Investment Board was founded in 2014, the year the Investment Promotion Law was introduced.

In 2014, to fight off the corruption factors facing foreign investors, Abdullah II of Jordan passed a new investment law that unified all bodies concerned with investment in the newly formed Jordan Investment Commission. In September 2015, the Kingdom signed a $7 billion investment deal agreement with China, and put the JIC in charge of fully enabling those investments in Jordan.

In September 2017, the Abdullah II of Jordan visited the JIC and reminded its strategic role in the Jordan Economic Growth Plan 2018-2022. In October 2017, the JIC signed a cooperation deal with the UAE's Ministry of economy for a protocol on technical cooperation regarding company registration.

### Jordan Investment Map

The Investment Map Project is an initiative that provides investors with 150 project ideas, and pre-feasibility studies for 75 of them in thirteen sectors including: Agriculture, Apparel and Textiles, Chemicals, Construction, Education, Energy and Utilities, Food and Beverage, Health, Information and Communication Technology, Mining and Processing, Pharmaceutical products, and Tourism.

Project concepts were derived from an extensive study of more than 30 sectors and sub sectors of Jordan during an analysis of the country's economy. Thirteen sectors were then selected and assessed, followed with an integrated selection framework to choose the most promising sectors in terms of growth, sustainability and potential returns. Project concepts were born from a value chain analysis and workshops with industry experts and leaders.


### One-Stop-Shop

Once an investor decides to proceed with their investment they could visit JIB's One-Stop-Shop, an approach to full service assistance for investors consisting of licensing and registration services. Through this service an investor can register and license his/her project in Jordan at one place within 14 days.


### Development Zones

In order to encourage investors to focus on areas which should serve as enabling platforms for specific sectors the several so called “Business/Development Zones” were created. These areas offer particular advantages from industry specific infrastructure; proximity to necessary human resources, as well was raw materials and attractive tax breaks. By enacting these laws the Government of Jordan provides the robust legal foundation to ensure a business friendly investment and operating environment.
