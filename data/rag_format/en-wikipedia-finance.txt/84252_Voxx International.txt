In 2020, Voxx International Corporation announced the change of name Klipsch Holding, LLC, which became *Premium Audio Company, LLC*. Premium Audio Company, LLC consists of two subsidiaries: Klipsch Group, Inc (brands: *Klipsch, Jamo, Energy*, *ProMedia*) and 11 Trading Company, LLC.

In May 2021, Voxx International and Sharp Corporation began negotiations with Onkyo to purchase its home audiovisual division. Voxx's subsidiary Premium Audio Company (PAC) entered a joint venture with Sharp to acquire the business, which includes the Onkyo and Integra brands, for $30.8 million. PAC would own 75% of the joint venture and Sharp 25%.
