# Malachy Postlethwayt



**Malachy Postlethwayt** (5 May 1707–13 September 1767) was a British economist and lexicographer, famous for his publication of the commercial dictionary titled *The Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce* in 1757. The dictionary was a translation and adaptation of the *Dictionnaire universel du commerce* of the French Inspector General of the Manufactures for the King, Jacques Savary des Brûlons.

Postlethwayt also wrote several works defending the slave trade and advocating for its expansion. He was a lobbyist for the Royal African Company and asserted that slave trade was central to British Empire's economic interests. In his first pamphlet, *The African Trade, the Great Pillar and Support of the British Plantation* (1745), Postlethwayt stated that “our West Indian and African Trades are the most nationally beneficial of any we carry on”. In reaction to those who denounced slave trade, he answered: “Many are prepossessed against this Trade, thinking it a barbarous, inhuman, and unlawful Traffic for a Christian Country to trade in Blacks” but Africans would be better off to “live in a civilized Christian Country” than among “Savages.”


## Life

Born 5 May 1707, Postlethwayt was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 21 March 1734. In 1743 he secured a position with the Royal Africa Company, and elected to its Court of Assistants (governing board) 17 January 1744. He wrote in the company's defence over the next two years.

Postlethwayt died suddenly on 13 September 1767 aged 60. He was buried in the Old Street churchyard, in Clerkenwell, north London.


## Works

Postlethwayt spent 20 years preparing *The Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce,* London, 1751 (3rd edit. London, 1766; 4th edit. London, 1774), a translation, with large additions, from the French work of Jacques Savary des Bruslons. Postlethwayt drew on Savary's work and Richard Cantillion as well as other writers of the day, and clarified how economic theory applied to economic and political issues current then.
