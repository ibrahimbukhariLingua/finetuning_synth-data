The Business (Tiësto song)


# The Business (Tiësto song)



"**The Business**" is a song by Dutch DJ and producer Tiësto, with uncredited vocals from James "Yami" Bell. It was released on 25 September 2020 as the lead single from his seventh studio album *Drive*.

At the APRA Music Awards of 2022, the song was nominated for Most Performed International Work.


## Music video

The music video premiered on Tiësto's official YouTube channel on 24 September 2020. Directed by Christian Breslauer, it features US dancers Casey Frey and Kyla Bullings. According to Jason Heffler from edm.com, Frey's "intoxicating dance interpretation is a fantastic accompaniment to the haunting sonic flair".
International airings of the music video remove the segment in which Frey's character is run over, thereby also removing the second refrain from the song.


## Cover art

The cover art was made by the visual artist Victor Scorrano.


## Remixes

A remix by British DJ and producer 220 Kid was released on 11 December 2020, which premiered on Tiësto's YouTube channel. There is also another version, titled "The Business Part II", which is a collaboration with US hip-hop/R&B artist Ty Dolla Sign, released on 21 January 2021. Another version of this song was released by The Marshall Project titled "Let's Get Down To Business" in 2021.
