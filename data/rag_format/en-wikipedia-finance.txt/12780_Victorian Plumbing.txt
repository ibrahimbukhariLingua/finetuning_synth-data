## Overview

At the time of their initial public offering, the company claimed that 86% of its sales came from retail customers.


## History

Mark Radcliffe founded the company in 2000. He began his career selling mobile phone accessories on eBay, and claims to have started the business from his parents' shed after setting up a website for his father, who restored Victorian bathrooms for recreational purposes. The organisation employs approximately 540 people across its headquarters in Leyland and Skelmersdale, Lancashire and its premises in Birmingham.

The company claims that it raised £11.6 million in new money to cover most of the costs of the IPO. JPMorgan is believedᵇʸ ʷʰᵒᵐ? to be among the group's largest non-family shareholders post-IPO.

In May 2024, Victorian Plumbing acquired its competitor Victoria Plum for £22.5 million, just over six months after Victoria Plum's pre-pack administration sale.

In late 2024, Victorian Plumbing began operations from its new administration and distribution facility in Farington Moss, Leyland.
