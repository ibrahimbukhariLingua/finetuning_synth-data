NextPage was created in 2013 when three strong regional print providers, Mail Print, L & L Manufacturing and Graphic Services, merged to form one company. NextPage is owned by Eric Danner, Gina Danner and Larry Wittmeyer, Jr. who had previously worked together on projects over twenty years. NextPage's offices and operational facility are located in the Hunt Midwest Subtropolis, an underground business complex.

### Innovations

In 2001, NextPage publicly launched their "Marketing Communications Portal," an online marketing asset management and ordering system for use by organizations and franchises to create and execute direct marketing materials. Early users of the system include Reece & Nichols Realtors, a real estate brokerage with more than 60 locations and 2,000 sales agents.

NextPage began using the Hewlett-Packard line of Indigo digital presses in 2002, which allowed for variable data print personalization by integrating database information during the digital printing process. As an early adopter of the technology, NextPage served as a HP test site.

In 2007, NextPage introduced a marketing automation tool that delivered a stream of automatic sales touches on a salesperson's behalf. The automated campaigns could be initiated to a single prospect or mailing list.

Other proprietary marketing systems include "Oyster," a user interface and database for creating and producing Personalized URLs.
