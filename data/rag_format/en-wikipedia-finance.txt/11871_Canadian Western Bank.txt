# Canadian Western Bank



**Canadian Western Bank** (**CWB**; French: *Banque canadienne de l'Ouest*), also operating as **CWB Financial Group**, was a Canadian bank based in Edmonton, Alberta. The bank serves clients both in Western Canada and in other provinces. It was announced on June 11, 2024 that it would be acquired by National Bank of Canada in 2025.

The CWB Financial Group is made up of 10 banking, lending, wealth and trust companies.

Its loan book is almost equally represented across BC, Alberta and Ontario. As part of its expansion plans, CWB has opened a branch in Mississauga, Ontario, just west of Toronto and a regional office in Downtown Toronto.


## History

Canadian Western Bank was formed through the 1988 merger of two banks: the Bank of Alberta (founded 1984), and the Western & Pacific Bank of Canada (founded 1982). It was led by Bank of Alberta co-founders Charles Alexander Allard and Eugene Pechet.

In 1993, it acquired Western Canadian branches of Metropolitan Trust. In 1994, Canadian Western Bank and North West Trust Company merged into Canadian Western Bank. In 1996, it acquired BC Bancorp (chartered in 1967), and purchased the Aetna Trust Company, which was renamed Canadian Western Trust Company. In 2001, it acquired the Kelowna and Regina branches of the Laurentian Bank of Canada.
