## Occupations

Mumbai has traditionally owed its prosperity largely to its textile mills and its seaport until the 1980s. These are now mostly replaced by industries employing more skilled labour such as engineering, diamond polishing, healthcare, pharmaceutical marketing and information technology. Mumbai is today India's primary financial centre, housing both major Indian stock exchanges (the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange, which are the 9th and 10th largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization), brokerages, asset management companies (including the majority of Indian mutual funds), the headquarters of most Indian state-owned and commercial banks, as well as the financial and monetary regulatory authorities of India (the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India) and many other institutions.

As Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra, government employees make up a large percentage of the city's workforce. Mumbai also has a large semi-skilled labour population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics and other such proletarian professions. The port of Mumbai and shipping industry too employs many residents directly and indirectly. Like most other metropolitan cities, Mumbai also has a large influx of people from rural areas looking for employment.
