# Ministry for Business and Made in Italy



The **Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy** (*Ministero delle imprese e del made in Italy*), commonly known under the shortening of its pre-2022 name, **MISE**, is a government ministry of the Italian Republic. It deals with production, economic activities, energy and mineral resources, telecommunications, consumers, tourism, internationalisation and business incentives. It was formed in 2006 after the reorganization of the Ministry of Productive Activities (called Ministry of Industry, Trade and Handicraft until 2001) to which were merged the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of International Trade in 2008.

The current minister is Adolfo Urso, appointed on 22 October 2022 by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The headquarters is located in Palazzo Piacentini, via Vittorio Veneto, Rome.


## History


### Kingdom of Italy

Since the Italian unification in 1861, policies related to productive activities were made by the **Ministry for Agriculture, Industry and Trade**, which was eliminated by the Depretis II Cabinet in 1877 and restored by Cairoli I Cabinet in 1878. In 1916, with the Boselli Cabinet, competences on labour and social security were added while the one on agriculture was removed: the dicastery became then the **Ministry for Industry, Trade and Labour**. In 1920, the Nitti II Cabinet established the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, maintaining the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

Several transformations occurred during the Mussolini Cabinet: the Ministry of National Economy was established in 1923 with the merger of the Ministries of Labour and Social Security, of Industry and Trade and of Agriculture, but it was later abolished in 1929 and its competences on agriculture were given to the reconstituted Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and those related to industry, trade and labour were transferred to the existing Ministry of Corporations. With the fall of Fascism, the Badoglio I Cabinet abolished the last one and recreated the Ministry for Industry, Trade and Labour.


### After World War II and republican period

During the second post-war period, the Parri Cabinet subdivided again in 1945 the competences between the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, while the De Gasperi II Cabinet spun off also the Ministry of Foreign Trade in 1946. In 1966, with Moro III Cabinet, the competence on handicrafts was added and the Dicastery was renamed in Ministry of Industry, Trade and Handicraft.

In order to reduce the number of Ministries, the Bassanini reforms issued between 1997 and 1999 and further implementing decrees determined the creation of the Ministry of Productive Activities, after the merging between the Ministries of Industry, of Foreign Trade and Communications. However, the last one was maintained autonomous by the Berlusconi II Cabinet in 2001.

In 2001, with the Prodi II Cabinet, the Department for Development and Economic Cohesion was incorporated into the Ministry of Treasury, Budget and Economic Planning (renamed later as Ministry of Economy and Finance) and the new Ministry of International Trade was established in 2006, along with the Ministry of Economic Development.

Only in 2008 the Bassanini reform was re-established and the MiSE included the functions of the Ministries of Communication and International Trade, which ceased to exists with the Berlusconi IV Cabinet. The last modification occurred in 2013 with the spun off of the Department for Development and Economic Cohesion and the creation of the new Agency for Territorial Cohesion under MiSE.

In 2022, the Ministry of Economic Development (*Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico*) was renamed to Ministry for Business and Made in Italy.
