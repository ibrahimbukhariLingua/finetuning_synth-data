In 2005, EcoSecurities Group Plc was listed in the London Stock Exchange, raising capital for an expansion drive that resulted in offices in 33 countries run by over 350 employees. This enabled the company to develop over 700 CDM projects located in 45 countries and using 50 technologies. These projects resulted in the largest carbon credit portfolio worldwide, worth over USD 4 billion, giving the company a significant global market share.

In June 2007, the company raised an additional €150 million to expand into new markets, with Credit Suisse becoming a major investor. Its trades in the international carbon market were valued at USD 41 billion in the first six months of 2008.

In 2009, the company was acquired by U.S. investment bank JP Morgan, when the company subsequently delisted from the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. In 2012, Eco Securities was sold to Swiss trader Mercuria Energy Group.

In 2019, former ecosecurities manager Pablo Fernandez and BVRio (an environmental markets NGO created by ecosecurities co-founder, Pedro Moura Costa) acquired the company and reactivated its project pipeline, contracts book, and alumni network, to participate in a new phase of carbon and environmental markets.
