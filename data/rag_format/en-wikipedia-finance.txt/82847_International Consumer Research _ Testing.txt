International Consumer Research & Testing


# International Consumer Research & Testing



**International Consumer Research & Testing (ICRT)** is a global consortium of more than 40 consumer organisations dedicated to carrying out joint research and testing in the consumer interest.

ICRT's principal objectives are to facilitate co-operation between its members and to promote research and testing in the field of consumer goods and services.


## ICRT Tests

ICRT members co-operate in a programme of continuous testing on a wide range of popular consumer products such as digital cameras, mobile phones, television sets, cars, washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners and light bulbs.

In addition, there are numerous other smaller collaborative tests, on a whole range of consumer products from anti-wrinkle creams to athletic shoes.

Safety has always been a topic of concern to consumer organisations. ICRT members have played a key role in promoting higher safety standards for consumer goods.

ICRT also facilitates information exchange and testing between members in areas such as food, health, the environment and financial services.

ICRT members join forces with motor clubs with the aim of testing cars, tyres and infant car seats. ICRT is a key player in European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) and a similar programme in Latin America.


## ICRT Members

All ICRT member organisations act exclusively in the consumer interest. They do not accept advertising and are independent of commerce, industry and political parties. Werner Brinkmann is the German member of the board of ICRT. ICRT works closely with the two other international campaigning consumer organisations, to which many ICRT members also belong:

* BEUC - The European Consumer Organisation
* CI - Consumers International

Member organisations range in size from the largest consumer organisations worldwide with memberships between 200,000 and 7 million to smaller organisations with less than 10,000 members.

ICRT's major members are: Which? (United Kingdom), Consumer Reports (United States of America), Stiftung Warentest (Germany), Association des Consommateurs *Test Achats* (Belgium), Union Fédérale des Consommateurs Que Choisir (France), Consumentenbond (Netherlands). ICRT has member organisations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa.
