# J. Michael Harrison



**John Michael Harrison** (born 1944) is an American researcher, known for his contributions to the theory of operations research, in particular stochastic networks and financial engineering. He has authored two books and nearly 90 journal articles.

He obtained a B.S. in industrial engineering from Lehigh University (1966), a M.S. from Stanford University (1967), and a Ph.D. in operations research (1970) also from Stanford University.

He then worked at the same place, in the Stanford Graduate School of Business, as assistant professor, promoted to associate professor (1973) and full professor (1978).
He is currently the *Adams Distinguished Professor of Management* at Stanford University.

His research focused on stochastic modelling for business and led to influential results in option theory (with David M. Kreps, 1980).
Later he studied Brownian network models for logistics and models for optimizing telephone call centers. More recently he has studied dynamic pricing and revenue management.

In 2008, Harrison was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for fundamental contributions to stochastic networks and financial engineering.
