## Climate Change Inaction

Wirth's company, Chevron, is responsible for one of the highest total carbon sequestration of any private company worldwide. Despite these practices, Wirth's company has been involved in several greenwashing tactics, and was found by a Federal Trade Commission to be misleading its customers on its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In response to CNBC host Jim Cramer asking if Chevron had considered calls to invest in alternative energy, Wirth responded that Chevron would rather the money “go back to our shareholders and let them plant trees, go invest in a wind and solar developer and have the right to do that with a growing dividend that comes out of our company.”

Wirth moved to Houston, Texas in 2024 as part of Chevron's corporate headquarters relocating to avoid high labor costs and other staffing issues in California.
