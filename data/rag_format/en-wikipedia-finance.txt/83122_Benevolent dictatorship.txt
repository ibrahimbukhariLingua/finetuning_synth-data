Benevolent dictatorship


# Benevolent dictatorship



A **benevolent dictatorship** is a government in which an authoritarian leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with regard for the benefit of the population as a whole. It stands in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator, who focuses on their supporters and their own self-interests.


## Characteristics

A benevolent dictator may allow for some civil liberties or democratic decision-making to exist, such as through public referendums or elected representatives with limited power and can make preparations for a transition to genuine democracy during or after their term.‚Åø·µâ·µâ·µà êû•·µò·µí·µó·µÉ·µó‚Å±·µí‚Åø ·µó·µí ·µõ·µâ ≥‚Å±·∂† ∏ Mancur Olson characterized such dictators as "not like the wolf that preys on the elk, but more like the rancher who makes sure his cattle are protected and are given water", arguing that they have an incentive to provide public goods at the same time they extract the largest possible surplus for themselves.

Economist William Easterly, using the term "benevolent autocrat", identifies two versions of the concept; one that argues that autocrats in general are simply superior to democratic leaders at producing rapid economic growth, and one that argues that the highest-quality autocrats are better at producing growth than the very best democratic leaders. Easterly says that both versions are unsupported by the available evidence, with leaders generally having no measurable effect on growth, and that the reason they have nonetheless persisted is because of their psychological appeal, which has allowed them to claim credit for natural growth that they had no hand in creating. He reports that this rhetoric, using economic development as a justification, was popular in the early 20th century as a support for colonial rulings. The British colonial official Lord Hailey said in the 1940s: "A new conception of our relationship...may emerge as part of the movement for the betterment of the backward peoples of the world".


## Leaders sometimes referred to as benevolent dictators


## In popular culture

In the Spanish language, the pun word *dictablanda* is sometimes used for a dictatorship conserving some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy. The pun is that, in Spanish, *dictadura* is "dictatorship", *dura* is "hard" and *blanda* is "soft". Analogously, the same pun is made in Portuguese as *ditabranda* or *ditamole*. In February 2009, the Brazilian newspaper *Folha de S.Paulo* ran an editorial classifying the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964‚Äì1985) as a "*ditabranda*", creating controversy.
