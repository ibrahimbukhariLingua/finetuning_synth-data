**Danske Bank A/S** (pronounced [ˈtænˀskə ˈpɑŋˀk], lit. 'Danish Bank') is a Danish multinational banking and financial services corporation. Headquartered in Copenhagen, it is the largest bank in Denmark and a major retail bank in the northern European region with over 5 million retail customers. Danske Bank was number 454 on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2011. The largest shareholder with 21% of the share capital is A.P. Moller Holding, the investment holding company of the Maersk family.

It was founded 5 October 1871 as *Den Danske Landmandsbank, Hypothek- og Vexelbank i Kjøbenhavn* ("The Danish Farmers' Bank, Mortgage and Exchange Bank of Copenhagen"), and was commonly known as *Landmandsbanken* ("the Farmers' Bank"). In 1976, the bank changed name to *Den Danske Bank* ("The Danish Bank"), and the current name was adopted in 2000.

Danske Bank was at the heart of what has been described as possibly the largest money laundering scandal in history when in 2017–2018 it was revealed that €800 billion of suspicious transactions had flowed through the Estonia-based bank branch of Danske Bank from 2007 to 2015. The bank was investigated by authorities in multiple countries. In 2022, Danske Bank pled guilty and agreed to a $2 billion fine in a case from the United States Department of Justice.

In Denmark, the major expansion occurred in 1990 after the merger with Kjøbenhavns Handelsbank and Provinsbanken. Most of the international operations were established by a series of acquisitions: of Östgöta Enskilda Bank in Sweden in 1997, of Fokus Bank in Norway in 1999, of Northern Bank in Northern Ireland in 2004, and of Sampo Bank in Finland, the Baltic countries, and Russia in 2007.

Danske Bank's Irish subsidiary was formerly known as the National Irish Bank, and was originally the Republic of Ireland branch network of Northern Bank, the oldest 'joint stock' bank in Ireland (dating back to 1824).

In 1988 the Republic of Ireland operation was renamed National Irish Bank Limited whilst Northern Bank Limited remained the name of the Northern Ireland operation. Nonetheless, a single management team continued to run both banks, which shared many services and back office functions. During this era, the logo of the National Irish Bank was that of the National Australia Bank (at the time), except that the red star had been recoloured green, and "Irish Bank" was added alongside the word "National". The original Northern Bank logo had been the Midland Bank griffin.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Controversies


### Money laundering scandal

Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, France, and the United Kingdom have launched investigations related to large-scale money laundering through Danske Bank. In 2018, the bank also faced a criminal investigation from the United States Department of Justice into the affair that saw €200bn of non-resident money flow through its branch in Estonia, which was under the supervision of the Financial Supervisory Authority of Denmark (due to location of headquarter) and the Financial Supervisory Authority of Estonia (due to location of branch). Danish prosecutors filed four preliminary charges in November 2018. As a consequence of the money laundering scandal Danske Bank was named as 2018's most corrupted actor by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. A Danish woman was remanded in custody in relation to the scandal in December 2021. In December 2022, Danske Bank pled guilty and agreed to a $2 billion fine in a case from the United States Department of Justice.


### Losing customers' debt records

On 30 August 2020, TV 2 and Berlingske released a report detailing how Danske Bank lost track of over 100,000 customers' accounts, which resulted in customers overpaying their debts. The issue was caused by a 2004 IT system migration, as well as several other database and accounting errors that have existed since 1979. Danske Bank issued an apology, calling the case "deeply regrettable," and offered compensation for account holders that the bank confirmed were affected by the issue. In a press release, the bank estimated that the total compensation for customers would be 80-100 million DKK (approximately US$13–16 million). The incident also raised questions on if the bank misled the Financial Supervisory Authority, which may result in fines or disciplinary actions.


### Shareholder Activism & Buyback

The Danske Bank share price dropped more than 70% following the disclosure of the Estonian money laundering scandal and the company was subsequently targeted by activist shareholders. Michael Strabo of Strabo Investments Limited publicly argued the Board of Directors should consider selling the company and implement a share buyback program in order to create shareholder value. In February 2024 Danske Bank announced a share buyback worth DKK 5.5 billion, representing 60bp of CET1 and management expressed the intention to increase the size of the buyback going forward.
