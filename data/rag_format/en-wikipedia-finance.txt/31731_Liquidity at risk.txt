Liquidity at risk


# Liquidity at risk



The **Liquidity-at-Risk** (short: **LaR**) is a measure of the liquidity risk exposure of a financial portfolio.

It may be defined as the net liquidity drain which can occur in the portfolio in a given risk scenario. If the Liquidity-at-Risk is greater than the portfolio's current liquidity position then the portfolio may face a liquidity shortfall.

Liquidity-at-Risk is different from other measures of risk based on total loss, as it is based on an estimate of cash losses, or liquidity outflows, as opposed to total loss.


## Definition

The **Liquidity-at-Risk** of a financial portfolio associated with a stress scenario is the net liquidity outflow resulting from this stress scenario:

The liquidity shortfall in a stress scenario is thus given by the difference between the Liquidity-at-Risk associated with the stress scenario and the amount of liquid assets available at the point where the scenario occurs.

The concept of Liquidity-at-Risk is used in stress testing. It is a conditional measure, which depends on the stress scenario considered.

By analogy with Value-at-Risk one may also define a statistical notion of Liquidity-at-Risk, at a given confidence level (e.g. 95%), which may be defined as the highest Liquidity-at-Risk that may occur across all scenarios considered under a probabilistic model, with probability higher than the confidence level.

This statistical notion of Liquidity-at-Risk is subject to model risk as it will depend on the probability distribution over scenarios.


## Relation with other risk measures

Liquidity-at-Risk is different from other measures of risk based on total loss, such as Value-at-Risk, as it is based on an estimate of cash losses, or liquidity outflows, as opposed to total loss.
