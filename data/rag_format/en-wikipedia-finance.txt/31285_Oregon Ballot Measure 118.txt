Oregon Ballot Measure 118


# Oregon Ballot Measure 118



**Oregon Ballot Measure 118**, the Corporate Tax Revenue Rebate for Residents Initiative, was a proposed Oregon state initiative that was decided by voters as part of the 2024 Oregon elections on November 5, 2024.

If accepted, the measure would have increased the state corporate minimum tax to 3% on businesses with sales of more than $25 million, and then used those funds to give a tax rebate of $1,600 to all Oregonians regardless of their income level.

The measure received overwhelming opposition from Oregon politicians across the political spectrum (including Governor Tina Kotek and State Treasurer Tobias Read), public policy organizations, and businesses. Opponents of the measure believe that an increased sales tax would be passed on to consumers through price increases, and criticized the tax rebate for its lack of income or age test (i.e. that even Oregon billionaires like Phil Knight or Tim Boyle would receive an annual check). The primary donors who supported the bill are Californian residents who wish to promote the idea of a universal basic income.
