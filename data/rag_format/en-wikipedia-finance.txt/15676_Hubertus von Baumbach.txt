**Hubertus von Baumbach** (born 1967) is a German businessman who is the chairman and CEO of Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany's second largest pharmaceutical company.


## Early life and education

The son of Erich von Baumbach and Ulrike Boehringer, Hubertus von Baumbach is also a great-grandson of the company's founder Albert Boehringer.


## Career

Baumbach joined Boehringer Ingelheim in 2001.

In November 2015, it was announced that Baumbach, who had been CFO, was appointed as chief executive, succeeding Andreas Barner in June 2016. At the time, this made him the first member of the family at the helm in 25 years. Within his first six months, he launched the biggest acquisition in the company's history (an asset swap deal with French rival Sanofi), followed by a reorganization to give the group a more decentralized divisional structure.

In his capacity at Boehringer Ingelheim, Baumbach was part of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s delegation on three state visits to China.
