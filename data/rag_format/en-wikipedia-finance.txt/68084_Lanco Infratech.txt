Lanco Infratech was created in 2006 to consolidate the 1960-founded Lanco Group's diverse operations under one brand. Initial growth was driven by large contracts primarily in construction. Later, other infrastructure areas such as power generation, transportation were also added. In 2017 the company became insolvent.

## Real estate

In 2012, Lanco Infratech obtained around 100-acre (0.40 km²) of land through bidding by the Andhra Pradesh government at ₹ 4.27 crore per acre for its ₹ 5,500 crore township project in Manikonda in Western Hyderabad.


## Debt restructuring

In December 2006, the company won a large contract citing collaboration with Singapore firm Globeleq. In 2007, after winning the bid for the 1000 MW Anpara-C power plant, Lanco requested that the power output be re-negotiated. Some competing firms protested since the re-negotiation made the initial bidding meaningless. However, Lanco managed to retain the Anpara project.

In June 2013, Lanco had won a contract for setting up two 300 MW power plants in Gujarat. However, the contract was cancelled in October 2013, when the company failed to put up the 10% guarantee required in the contract.
By July 2013, the company had filed for debt restructuring, citing a business slowdown. In September,ʷʰᵉⁿ? it was revealed that the company had reduced its workforce by nearly half.

Repeatedly tarnished by charges of corrupt practices the company ran into financial trouble and filed for corporate debt restructuring in
July 2013. In late 2017 the company faced insolvency proceedings, with the National Company Law Tribunal suspending the board.


## Liquidation

In August 2018, Hyderabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordered the liquidation of Lanco Infratech.
