## Controversy

Latitude 360 is currently under criminal investigation for bouncing employees' final paychecks. The employees were also affected when they attempted to collect unemployment benefits. The company had not been reporting these employees to the state or paying any of the associated payroll taxes collected from employees. The company currently has $88 million in current liabilities as filed in August 2015. The current market cap is less than $1M USD. On February 10, 2016, Florida's Action Jax News reporter Jenna Bourne found out from insiders that there was a substantial amount of money missing from the company.

On January 26, 2022,
Brent Brown, the former CEO of Latitude 360, was arraigned (News4Jax) in federal court on 17 counts of failing to pay the IRS payroll taxes from his employees.


## Locations

On January 7, 2016 it was announced that the Indianapolis, Indiana and Jacksonville, Florida locations were closed due to the settlement of an eviction suit from the landlord. The company had been behind on rent since December 2012, and at the time of the suit owed $6 million dollars in rent and associated fees. As part of the rapid closure, the employees were not paid their final paychecks. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania location was closed in March, 2016. The establishment failed to pay its Allegheny County drink tax, and on February 29, 2016, a judge ruled that the company could be evicted from its premises in 30 days.

The Albany, New York location at Crossgates Mall was never opened; it was replaced by a Lucky Strike Lanes location.
