## Admissions


### Undergraduate

Prospective Stern undergraduate candidates apply in their senior year of high school either through the Early Decision I (EDI), Early Decision II (EDII), or Regular Decision (RD) process. Unlike many other undergraduate business programs where students transfer in after their first or second year, Stern applicants apply specifically for Stern during their senior year of high school. These candidates are then grouped with a pool of Stern applicants separate from those applying to the New York University’s other colleges, such as the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), Tisch School of Arts, and Tandon School of Engineering.

At the time of applying, prospective students must also indicate their program of choice: BTE, BPE, or BS in Business.
