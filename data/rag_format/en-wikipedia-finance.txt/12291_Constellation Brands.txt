In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000. The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973. Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.

## Controversies

In 1991, the company reached a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to change the packaging and marketing of Cisco wine after the FTC alleged that Cisco's marketing was deceptively similar to wine coolers despite Cisco having a much higher alcohol content.

In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers, including Constellation, for selling fake pinot noir wine to US buyers in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.

In 2018 Constellation Brands was involved in a water rights dispute over a proposed manufacturing facility in the desert city of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. The water was from the Colorado River, which not only supplies the water for Mexicali and the agricultural valley but is also piped to the mountain and coastal cities of Tijuana, Tecate, Rosarito and some areas of Ensenada.

In 2021, AB InBev sued Constellation Brands after the company launched two new Modelo-branded beers on the US market, arguing that the first beer illegally used the term "tequila" to describe the barrels where the beer was aged, and that the second beer was inappropriately using the term "bourbon" to describe the barrels where the beer was aged because bourbon has nothing to do with Mexico.
