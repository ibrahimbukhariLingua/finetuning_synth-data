**Zhao Xiao** (Chinese: 赵晓; pinyin: *Zhào Xiǎo*; born March 1967) is a Chinese economist who has gained attention for arguing that China’s economy would benefit from the spread of Christianity.

In 2002 he published a paper entitled "Market Economies With Churches and Market Economies Without Churches", which argued that the key to America's commercial success was its churches.

Zhao began to study the Bible with the intent of proving there was no truth in it, but after three months, he “admitted defeat” and converted to Christianity.
