## Career

Narasimhan succeeded Rakesh Kapoor as CEO of Reckitt Benckiser in September 2019, formulating a turnaround plan which was intended to rejuvenate the company "following a series of missteps and lacklustre growth that marked the final years of his predecessor". In September 2022 the company unexpectedly announced his resignation, explaining that he had "decided for personal and family reasons to relocate back to the United States and has been approached for an opportunity that enables him to live there."

In September 2022, Starbucks announced that Narasimhan would become the company's next CEO. He succeeded Howard Schultz, who had been interim CEO since Kevin Johnson resigned in March 2022.
