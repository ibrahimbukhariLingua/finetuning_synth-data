## History

Rayonier was founded in 1926 as the **Rainier Pulp and Paper Company** in Shelton, Washington, with a headquarters office in San Francisco, California. Its name was inspired by Mount Rainier in Washington state. Its first mill opened the next year in Shelton Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The mill used *Tsuga heterophylla* (western hemlock) trees to create a premium bleached paper pulp.

In September 1930, Rainier Pulp and Paper began working with the DuPont chemical company to produce hemlock pulp for the manufacture of rayon. Two additional pulp mills were constructed and began operation in the state of Washington at Hoquiam, Washington and Port Angeles, Washington.

Rainier Pulp and Paper changed its name to Rayonier, a portmanteau of the words *rayon* and *Rainier*, in 1937, when it became a publicly traded company. The following year, the company acquired timber stands in the southeastern United States, and began construction of a Fernandina Beach, Florida, pulp mill, which began production in 1939.

In 1944, the company moved its offices to New York City. As World War II ended, Rayonier began making large land purchases in the Pacific Northwest. The Rayonier Foundation was created in 1952 to provide assistance to charitable, civic and education organizations in the communities where Rayonier did business.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Rayonier opened international sales offices in Europe and Asia during 1954. That same year, another pulp mill in the southeast was constructed at Jesup, Georgia. High demand prompted the facility to double its capacity by 1957.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

ITT purchased the company in 1968 and the name changed to ITT Rayonier.

The Jesup mill grew larger in 1974, becoming the largest pulp mill on earth.

Company headquarters were moved again in 1978; this time to Stamford, Connecticut.

Diplomatic relations with China were restored in 1979. The following year, Rayonier received orders for pulp and logs. It took almost five years to receive permission to open an office in Beijing in 1985.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

A log-trading office was opened in New Zealand during 1988. The New Zealand government sold Rayonier 250,000 acres (1,000 km²) of timberland in 1992.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The company was spun off from ITT in 1994 with the company name reverting to Rayonier and shares again traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Rayonier purchased 969,000 acres (3,920 km²) of timberland in Florida, Georgia and Alabama in 1999, then relocated the corporate offices to Jacksonville, Florida, to be closer to company employees and properties.

Rayonier converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) on January 1, 2004.
TerraPointe LLC was established in 2005 to manage properties with development potential.

In March 2008, the company purchased 56,300 acres (228 km²) for $215 million in southwest Washington state from Sierra Pacific

In March 2013, the company sold its wood products division, including its mills in Baxley, Swainsboro, and Eatonton, Georgia, to British Columbia-based International Forest Products (Interfor) for $80 million.

In May 2014, Rayonier named David L. Nunes as post-separation president and CEO for Rayonier.

A class action against members of the former management team by certain shareholders was launched for the period from October 26, 2010, to November 7, 2014, claiming over-harvesting while communicating publicly harvesting below a sustainable rate.
On October 5, 2017, the court entered orders approving the settlement and a plan of distribution terminating these class actions.

In June 2014, Rayonier spun off its performance fibers business into an independent, publicly traded company, Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM). Shareholders of Rayonier received one share of the new Rayonier Advanced Materials company for every three shares of Rayonier on June 27, 2014.
