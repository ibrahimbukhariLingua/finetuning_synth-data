S&R Membership Shopping


# S&R Membership Shopping



**S&R Membership Shopping** is a membership-only retail warehouse club chain in the Philippines.


## History

S&R Membership Shopping was established in 2001 as S&R PriceSmart, a franchise of the American membership-only warehouse club chain PriceSmart. The name "S&R" stands for American businessmen Sol and Robert Price, founders of Price Club and PriceSmart. PriceSmart was the first major foreign retailer to enter the Philippine market since the passage of the Retail Trade Act of 2000, which liberalized the retail sector. In November 2001, PriceSmart opened its first branch on a 5,000 m² (0.50 ha) property in Bonifacio Global City, then known as The Fort.

In 2005, PriceSmart sold its share in the joint venture and was acquired by the Co family in 2006, and the retail chain was renamed as S&R Membership Shopping. The Co family's operations over S&R is taken care of by Kareila Management, Inc. which also operates the Puregold Price Club.

The chain opened three more branches in Metro Manila before opening its first branch outside of Metro Manila and Luzon in Mandaue, Cebu in 2010.

In 2012, Puregold and Kareila underwent a merger. The former bought all the stakes of Kareila Management over S&R.

In 2014, S&R opened its first standalone membership-free S&R New York Style Pizza restaurant in Fairview Terraces in Quezon City.
