Committee on Fuel Poverty


# Committee on Fuel Poverty



The **Committee on Fuel Poverty** (CFP) is an advisory non-departmental public body of the government of the United Kingdom, sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. Its role is to advise on the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing fuel poverty, and encourage greater co-ordination across the organisations working to reduce fuel poverty.

The Committee on Fuel Poverty replaced the former Fuel Poverty Advisory Group (FPAG). This follows a triennial review of FPAG which took place during 2014.

The former FPAG was established in 2001. The Triennial Review of FPAG in 2014 concluded that FPAG performed an important function as an expert advisory group and that it should continue in this role as an advisory Non-Departmental Public Body. It also recommended ways to improve the way in which it operates, to enhance its ability to provide independent, expert advice. The Department of Energy and Climate Change proceeded to reform the group during 2015, including transitioning the group's composition from organisational representatives to independent expert members, leading to the establishment of the CFP in place of the former FPAG.
