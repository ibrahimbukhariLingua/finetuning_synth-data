GMDC also owns and runs Akrimota Thermal Power Station, a 250 MW (2x125 MW) lignite-based thermal power plant located in village Nanichher in Lakhpat Taluka, Kutch District.


## Product range

The company has grown in strength since its inception over the years. In 1963 the company commenced its operation with small silica sand quarry. In 1964 it started with bauxite mines in Kutch and now operates six bauxite mines. In 1971, a beneficiation plant was commissioned by GMDC to process 500 M.T of fluorspar ore and to produce calcium fluoride used for the manufacture of Hydro-fluoric acid and as flux in metallurgical industries. A captive mine at Ambadungar was established also to feed the plant. In 1976 lignite was discovered in Gujarat and GMDC started its first lignite mines at Panadhro. In 1980, a captive refining plant with copper mines was set up by GMDC near Ambaji. In 1983, another lignite mine was discovered & started by it at Rajpardi near Bharuch.
