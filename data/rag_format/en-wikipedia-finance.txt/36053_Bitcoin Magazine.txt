***Bitcoin Magazine*** is one of the original news and print magazine publishers covering Bitcoin and digital currencies. *Bitcoin Magazine* began publishing in 2012. It was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Matthew N. Wright, Vladimir Marchenko, and Vicente S. It is currently owned and operated by BTC Inc in Nashville, Tennessee.


## History

Vitalik Buterin became interested in Bitcoin in 2011, and co-founded the periodical *Bitcoin Magazine* with Mihai Alisie, who asked him to join. Alisie was living in Romania at the time, and Buterin was writing for a blog. Buterin's writing captured the attention of Alisie, and they subsequently decided to start the magazine. Buterin took the role of head writer as a side project while attending university.

In 2012, *Bitcoin Magazine* began publishing a print edition from its base in South Korea and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies. Buterin noted he spent 10-20 hours per week writing for the publication.

In early 2015, *Bitcoin Magazine* was sold to its current owners, BTC Inc.

A physical copy of a 2014 edition of *Bitcoin Magazine* was displayed in the Smithsonian Museum as part of the Value of Money exhibit.

In September 2021, *Bitcoin Magazine* announced the launch of their Eastern European bureau based in Kyiv.

In December 2021, New England Patriots quarterback Mac Jones partnered with *Bitcoin Magazine* to gift both Bitcoin and *Bitcoin Magazine* subscriptions to his offensive line.
