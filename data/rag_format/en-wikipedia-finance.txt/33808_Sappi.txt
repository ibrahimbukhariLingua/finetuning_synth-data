## Global acquisitions and closures

In 1990, Sappi purchased the paper mills of UK Dickinson Robinson Group â€“ Nash Mills, Keynsham Paper Mill and Fife Paper Mills from the asset-stripper Roland Franklin (Pembridge Investments). These mills were subsequently closed by Sappi as were all other acquisitions (Kymmini Oy, Blackburn Mill and Wolvercote Mill) they had made in the UK.

The company's existing kraft pulp plant in Cloquet, Minnesota was replaced by a new mill which began producing dissolving pulp in June 2013.


## Price fixing controversy

In 1996, Sappi along other 10 main producers of carbonless paper was investigated by the European Commission for illegal price fixing in various countries in the EU. Although found guilty of earning millions by fixing the price of printing paper, Sappi was granted full immunity from the fine due to its cooperation with the EC's cartel investigating unit. Other companies implicated were fined a total of $145 million.
