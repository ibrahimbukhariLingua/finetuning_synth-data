Clark Construction


# Clark Construction



**Clark Construction**, also referred to as **Clark Construction Group, LLC**, is a construction firm headquartered in McLean, Virginia, and founded in 1906. The company had 2018 annual revenue of more than $5 billion, and is one of the largest commercial and civil contractors in the country. Some projects include Capital One Arena and L'Enfant Plaza.


## History

The company traces its founding to the George Hyman Construction Company, an excavating company, in 1906. Business boomed, as it initially had the only steam shovel in Washington. The company began doing construction work in 1923; its first such contract was with Wheatley Junior High School. The company was involved in numerous military construction projects during World War II.

Hyman died in 1970 and was succeeded by his nephew Benjamin Rome.

In 1969, A. James Clark bought the company from the Hyman family and oversaw major growth including one of its earliest projects L'Enfant Plaza in Washington. Clark formed a separate company in 1977 for non-union projects in the Washington area (Hyman legally could not bid on such projects). In 1995, Clark merged construction companies of Hyman, Shirley Contracting Company, Guy F. Atkinson Construction and OMNI to form Clark Construction.

In 2016, a year after Clark died, firm management bought the company from its parent Clark Enterprises, leaving the parent to concentrate on its private equity, financial and real estate markets.
