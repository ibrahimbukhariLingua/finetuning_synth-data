## Controversies

On 5 January 2022, Carrie Lam announced new warnings and restrictions against social gatherings due to a potential new round of COVID-19 outbreak. One day later, it was discovered that Hung's 53rd birthday party hosted 222 guests. At least one guest was tested positive with COVID-19, therefore many attendees had to be quarantined, including several principal officials of Hong Kong.
