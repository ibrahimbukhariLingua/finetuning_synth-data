## History

ABB traced its origins to the former Australian Barley Board. Due to the company's expanded operations into different areas, it demutualised to become ABB Grain on 1 July 1999. In 2004, the company merged with the South Australian storage and handling company AusBulk and the holding company United Grower Holdings. This brought about the control of the two major grain handlers, along with several of AusBulk's divisions.

Ater its merger with AusBulk, ABB's supply chain involved operations in storage and handling and logistics, including a significant network of silos and export shipping terminals in South Australia and the eastern states of Australia, and incorporating joint ownership of Australian Bulk Alliance, or ABA, with Japanese trading company Sumitomo.

The company also provided rural services including fertiliser and agrichemical supply and wool and livestock activities. The latter were supported by the acquisitions of the Adelaide Wool Company, Wardle Co and Stawool in 2007.

ABB had significant operations in New Zealand focused on the trading and distribution of grains and proteins. In 2007, the company established a joint venture in Ukraine with French malting company Soufflet to accumulate grain, manage supply chain activities and market grain.

On 19 May 2009 it was announced that ABB would be acquired in September 2009 by Viterra, the largest grain handler in Canada, if voted ahead by the shareholders. The head office would be relocated to Regina, Saskatchewan, with the worldwide malting headquarters remaining in Adelaide. The two companies together were responsible for 37 per cent of the world's exports of wheat, canola and barley. Shareholders approved the merger on 9 September.
