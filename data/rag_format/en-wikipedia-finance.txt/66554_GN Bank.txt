In 2019 the bank of Ghana revoked the licenses of 23 savings and loans companies and finance house companies which included the GN bank.

A statement issued by the BoG on Friday, 16 August 2019 said the revocation of the licences of the institutions had become necessary because they were insolvent even after a reasonable period within which the Bank of Ghana had engaged with them in the hope that they would be recapitalized by their shareholders to return them to solvency.
