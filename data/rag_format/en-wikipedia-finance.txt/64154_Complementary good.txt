Complementary good


# Complementary good



In economics, a **complementary good** is a good whose appeal increases with the popularity of its complement.ᶠᵘʳᵗʰᵉʳ ᵉˣᵖˡᵃⁿᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Technically, it displays a negative cross elasticity of demand and that demand for it increases when the price of another good decreases. If {\displaystyle A} is a complement to {\displaystyle B}, an increase in the price of {\displaystyle A} will result in a negative movement along the demand curve of {\displaystyle A} and cause the demand curve for {\displaystyle B} to shift inward; less of each good will be demanded. Conversely, a decrease in the price of {\displaystyle A} will result in a positive movement along the demand curve of {\displaystyle A} and cause the demand curve of {\displaystyle B} to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. This is in contrast to a substitute good, whose demand decreases when its substitute's price decreases.

When two goods are complements, they experience *joint demand* - the demand of one good is linked to the demand for another good. Therefore, if a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and *vice versa*. For example, the demand for razor blades may depend on the number of razors in use; this is why razors have sometimes been sold as loss leaders, to increase demand for the associated blades. Another example is that sometimes a toothbrush is packaged free with toothpaste. The toothbrush is a complement to the toothpaste; the cost of producing a toothbrush may be higher than toothpaste, but its sales depends on the demand of toothpaste.

All non-complementary goods can be considered substitutes. If {\displaystyle x} and {\displaystyle y} are rough complements in an everyday sense, then consumers are willing to pay more for each marginal unit of good {\displaystyle x} as they accumulate more {\displaystyle y}. The opposite is true for substitutes: the consumer is willing to pay less for each marginal unit of good "{\displaystyle z}" as it accumulates more of good "{\displaystyle y}".

Complementarity may be driven by psychological processes in which the consumption of one good (e.g., cola) stimulates demand for its complements (e.g., a cheeseburger). Consumption of a food or beverage activates a goal to consume its complements: foods that consumers believe would taste better together. Drinking cola increases consumers' willingness to pay for a cheeseburger. This effect appears to be contingent on consumer perceptions of these relationships rather than their sensory properties.


## Examples

An example of this would be the demand for cars and petrol. The supply and demand for cars is represented by the figure, with the initial demand {\displaystyle D\_{1}}. Suppose that the initial price of cars is represented by {\displaystyle P\_{1}} with a quantity demanded of {\displaystyle Q\_{1}}. If the price of petrol were to decrease by some amount, this would result in a higher quantity of cars demanded. This higher quantity demanded would cause the demand curve to shift rightward to a new position {\displaystyle D\_{2}}. Assuming a constant supply curve {\displaystyle S} of cars, the new increased quantity demanded will be at {\displaystyle Q\_{2}} with a new increased price {\displaystyle P\_{2}}. Other examples include automobiles and fuel, mobile phones and cellular service, printer and cartridge, among others.


## Perfect complement

A *perfect complement* is a good that *must* be consumed with another good. The indifference curve of a perfect complement exhibits a right angle, as illustrated by the figure. Such preferences can be represented by a Leontief utility function.

Few goods behave as perfect complements. One example is a left shoe and a right; shoes are naturally sold in pairs, and the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1.

The degree of complementarity, however, does not have to be mutual; it can be measured by the cross price elasticity of demand. In the case of video games, a specific video game (the complement good) has to be consumed with a video game console (the base good). It does not work the other way: a video game console does not have to be consumed with that game.


### Example

In marketing, complementary goods give additional market power to the producer. It allows vendor lock-in by increasing switching costs. A few types of pricing strategy exist for a complementary good and its base good:

* Pricing the base good at a relatively low price - this approach allows easy entry by consumers (e.g. low-price consumer printer vs. high-price cartridge)
* Pricing the base good at a relatively high price to the complementary good - this approach creates a barrier to entry and exit (e.g., a costly car vs inexpensive gas)

## Gross complements

Sometimes the complement-relationship between two goods is not intuitive and must be verified by inspecting the cross-elasticity of demand using market data.

Mosak's definition states "a good {\displaystyle x} is a gross complement of {\displaystyle y} if {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f\_{x}(p,\omega )}{\partial p\_{y}}}} is negative, where {\displaystyle f\_{i}(p,\omega )} for {\displaystyle i=1,2,\ldots ,n} denotes the ordinary individual demand for a certain good." In fact, in Mosak's case, {\displaystyle x} is not a gross complement of {\displaystyle y} but {\displaystyle y} is a gross complement of {\displaystyle x}. The elasticity does not need to be symmetrical. Thus, {\displaystyle y} is a gross complement of {\displaystyle x} while {\displaystyle x} can simultaneously be a gross substitutes for {\displaystyle y}.


### Proof

The standard Hicks decomposition of the effect on the ordinary demand for a good {\displaystyle x} of a simple price change in a good {\displaystyle y}, utility level {\displaystyle \tau ^{\*}} and chosen bundle {\displaystyle z^{\*}=(x^{\*},y^{\*},\dots )} is

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f\_{x}(p,\omega )}{\partial p\_{y}}}={\frac {\partial h\_{x}(p,\tau ^{\*})}{\partial p\_{y}}}-y^{\*}{\frac {\partial f\_{x}(p,\omega )}{\partial \omega }}}

If {\displaystyle x} is a gross substitute for {\displaystyle y}, the left-hand side of the equation and the first term of right-hand side are positive. By the symmetry of Mosak's perspective, evaluating the equation with respect to {\displaystyle x^{\*}}, the first term of right-hand side stays the same while some extreme cases exist where {\displaystyle x^{\*}} is large enough to make the whole right-hand-side negative. In this case, {\displaystyle y} is a gross complement of {\displaystyle x}. Overall, {\displaystyle x} and {\displaystyle y} are not symmetrical.
