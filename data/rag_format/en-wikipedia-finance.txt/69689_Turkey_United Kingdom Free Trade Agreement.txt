Turkey–United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement


# Turkey–United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement



The **Turkey–United Kingdom free trade agreement (TUKFTA)** is a proposed free trade agreement which began negotiations on 14 March 2024.

## History

From 31 December 1995 until 30 December 2020, trade between Turkey and the United Kingdom was governed by the European Union–Turkey Customs Union, while the UK was a member of the European Union. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK and Turkey signed a continuity trade agreement on 29 December 2020, based on the EU free trade agreement; the agreement entered into force on 1 January 2021.


## Negotiations

The UK opened up a trade consultation from 2 November 2023 and close on the 5 January 2024. Trade negotiations formally opened on 14 March 2024. The practical negotiations are scheduled for after the UK general election on 4 July.
