## Early life and education


### Early years

Blair Hull was born in 1942, the son of Marson Hull and Jean Matlock Hull, and raised in Los Gatos, California—near what would later be called Silicon Valley. After completing high school, Hull went to work on the assembly line of a cannery factory to help support his family, ultimately joining Union Local 679 and earning himself a union card by the age of 19.

During the Vietnam buildup, Hull served six years in the United States Army. After reaching the rank of lieutenant and completing his military service, Blair Hull turned to the classroom, teaching high school level math and physics before becoming a student again himself and going on to higher education with the GI Bill, as his father had done before him.

He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, his MBA from Santa Clara University and graduated from the Harvard *Owner/President Management* Program.

While working full-time at a manufacturing company, Hull tested his mathematical and analytical skills at the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, where he proved to be a skilled and disciplined player. Hull took his accumulated winnings to the Pacific Stock Exchange, then to the Chicago financial exchanges. Once there, he established himself as a pioneer in the trading industry, revolutionizing the financial markets through the use of innovative models and state-of-the-art technology.

As Founder of Hull Trading Company, Blair Hull built a business from scratch in Illinois, created hundreds of jobs, and grew his company into one of the most successful trading firms in the country.


## Blackjack

In 2022, Blair Hull was inducted into the Blackjack Hall of Fame, an organization that honors
the greatest blackjack experts, authors and professional players in history. Hull was a big player in Al Francesco’s blackjack team in the mid-’70s, is responsible for the Hall of Fame’s success in forming its own 501-C3 Charitable Foundation, and is also the recipient of the first “Ed Thorp Lifetime Achievement Award.”

Trained in mathematics and computer science, Blair Hull first applied his skills and training to advantage play in blackjack, and then went on to develop an empirical model independent of Black–Scholes to use on the financial markets. Throughout the 1970s, Hull honed his system on the casino floors. As one of the “Big Players” on Al Francesco’s storied blackjack team, Blair beat the odds, or rather, beat the house by shifting the edge in his favor. By utilizing mathematical systems - first Edward O. Thorp's 10 Count Card system, and later Lawrence Revere's Advanced Point Count system - Hull and a team of skilled card players were able to determine when they gained an advantage over the dealer, and how best to bet to exploit that advantage. They consistently turned a profit, and their story is outlined in the book "The Big Player" by Ken Uston.

Hull left the blackjack tables with $25,000 and took his winnings to the markets—first leasing a seat on the Pacific Stock Exchange, then starting a firm on the Chicago financial exchanges.

Hull's candidacy brought a unique background to the crowded Democratic field.

2004 United States Senate election in Illinois Democratic primary
| Party | | Candidate | Votes | % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Democratic** | **Barack Obama** | **655,923** | **52.8%** |
| Democratic | Daniel W. Hynes | 294,717 | 23.7% |
| Democratic | M. Blair Hull | 134,453 | 10.8% |
| Democratic | Maria Pappas | 74,987 | 6.0% |
| Democratic | Gery Chico | 53,433 | 4.3% |
| Democratic | Nancy Skinner | 16,098 | 1.3% |
| Democratic | Joyce Washington | 13,375 | 1.1% |
| Democratic | Estella Johnson-Hunt (write-in) | 10 | 0.0% |
| Total votes | | | **1,242,996** | **100.0%** |

Hull was unique among the candidate field: he was an Army veteran, had been a card-carrying union member, had taught students as a high school math teacher, and was a successful businessman who had built a business and created jobs in Illinois.
During the campaign, Hull railed against the corporate special interests and their influence in Washington. He advocated universal healthcare, greater efficiency in government, campaign finance reform, and re-importation of prescription drugs.

Hull garnered nationwide attention for inviting scores of prescription-drug dependent senior citizens aboard his campaign buses to travel across the US/ Canada border into Windsor, Ontario where they could purchase their medications at dramatically lower prices. The trips served to focus media attention on the rising costs of American healthcare, and to frame the debate as the campaign moved forward.

Hull largely self-funded his campaign for Senate, spending $29 million of his own money on the race. His early start, compelling profile, considerable fortune, and heavy campaign advertising on television ensured that Hull led the crowded Democratic field for much of the primary race.
While Hull topped the polls till the final weeks of the campaign, Barack Obama succeeded in winning the election. Blair Hull finished third. Hull's numbers dropped late in the race following allegations of marital issues. Hull held the record on the most money self-funded by a candidate in a U.S. Senate primary election until 2024, when U.S. representative David Trone gave his campaign over $40 million during the primary of the 2024 United States Senate election in Maryland. Hull remains active in Democratic politics, both as an activist and a donor.
