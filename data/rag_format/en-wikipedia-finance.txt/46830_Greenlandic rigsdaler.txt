Greenlandic rigsdaler


# Greenlandic rigsdaler



The **rigsdaler** was the currency of Greenland until 1874. It was equal to the Danish rigsdaler which circulated in Greenland alongside distinct banknotes from 1803.


## History

Before 1813, the *rigsdaler courant* was subdivided into 96 *skilling*. In 1813, the rigsdaler courant was replaced by the *rigsbanksdaler* at a rate of 6 rigsdaler courant = 1 rigsbanksdaler, with the rigsbanksdaler subdivided into 96 *rigsbank skilling*. In 1854, the names were changed to the *rigsdaler* and *skilling rigsmønt*. In 1874, the kroner was introduced, at a rate of 2 kroner = 1 rigsdaler. See Danish rigsdaler for a more detailed history.


## Banknotes

In 1803, the *Kongelige grønlandske Handel* introduced notes in denominations of 12 and 24 skilling, 1⁄2 and 1 rigsdaler courant. The next year, the *Handelsstederne i Grønland* took over the issuance of paper money and introduced notes for 6 and 12 skilling, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1 and 5 rigsdaler courant.

In 1819, following the currency reform, notes were introduced in denominations of 6, 12 and 24 skilling and 1 rigsbankdaler. These were replaced in 1856 by notes for the same amounts but in the new denominations of skilling rigsmønt and rigsdaler.
