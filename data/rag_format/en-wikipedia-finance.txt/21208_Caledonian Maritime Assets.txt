Caledonian Maritime Assets


# Caledonian Maritime Assets



**Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited** (usually shortened to **CMAL** or **CMAssets**; **Stòras Mara Cailleannach Earr** in Scottish Gaelic) owns the ferries, ports, harbours and infrastructure for the ferry services serving the west coast of Scotland, the Firth of Clyde and the Northern Isles.

CMAL is a wholly owned public corporation of the Scottish Government, with Scottish ministers as sole shareholders.


## History

Until 1 October 2006 Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd, which was wholly owned by the Scottish government, provided the majority of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services and owned the associated vessels and a number of the ports and harbour facilities that the vessels used. These services required an annual revenue deficit grant from the then Scottish Executive to maintain lifeline service levels.

To comply with European guidelines on State Aids in Maritime Transport, an open public tender was deemed necessary in respect of these ferry services and the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services (CHFS) was tendered as a single bundle, with the exception of the Gourock-Dunoon service.

In recognition of the uniqueness of the fleet and to ensure a level playing field for all bidders, on 1 October 2006 Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd was split into:

* An asset-owning company, Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL)
* A new operating company, CalMac Ferries Ltd (CFL).

This was done by Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd transferring its operations—but not its assets—to CFL. The operation of the lifeline ferry service was then put out to open competitive tender.

CMAL now owns all vessels, the majority of land-based assets (ports, harbours, etc.) and the Caledonian MacBrayne brand, and makes them available to an operator through an open tendering process. CFL continues to operate the services after winning the tendering process and holds the Public Services Contract (PSC) until 30 September 2013. Under the terms of the tender, CFL is bound to use the vessels of CMAL.


## Business

CMAL's responsibilities include:

* Maintaining, improving and enhancing assets such as vessels and the land and property around piers and harbours
* Seeking extra investment to invest in ferries and harbour facilities
* Working with stakeholders within Scotland and the wider maritime community to be acknowledged as the principal provider of the most cost-effective, innovative ferries and port infrastructure to the benefit of local communities

## Ferries

CMAL currently owns 37 ferries, of which 32 are operated by CalMac Ferries on routes to the islands and peninsulas of the west of Scotland. In April 2018 it was agreed that the five vessels operated by NorthLink Ferries on routes to the Orkney and Shetland islands would also join the fleet. Many ferries are specially built for the ports they serve yet are still interchangeable and able to serve different crossings and can carry from one to 143 cars. The total fleet value was estimated at £130m in 2017. The newest vessel in the fleet, MV Glen Sannox, was handed over to CalMac on 21 November 2024, and entered service on the Troon-Brodick route on 12 January 2025.


### Clyde and Hebrides Islands ferries (Caledonian MacBrayne)


### Northern Isles ferries (NorthLink Ferries)


### Former vessels

MV Raasay and MV Eigg ceased operation with Caledonian MacBrayne in early 2018, and are now no longer part of the fleet. MV Hebridean Isles was withdrawn from service in November 2024, and spare parts which could be used for maintaining other vessels are currently being removed for storage. She will later be taken to a shipbreakers for final disposal.


## Harbours

CMAL is Harbour Authority at 24 locations across Scotland and owns the associated port infrastructure and properties at each of these locations. Additionally, CMAL owns and leases a number of properties at various locations associated with the delivery of Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services.

As Statutory Harbour Authority for a number of these harbours, CMAL's responsibilities and duties include:

* A duty of care to all port users
* An obligation to conserve and promote the safe use of the harbours
* Responsibility for efficiency, economy and safety of operation, in respect of the services and facilities provided.

## Completed projects


### Hybrid ferries project

On 17 December 2012, the world's first seagoing roll-on/roll-off vehicle and passenger diesel–electric hybrid ferry was launched by CMAL on the Clyde. MV Hallaig incorporates a low-carbon hybrid system of diesel electric and lithium-ion battery power. The 135-tonne ferry is nearly 150 feet long and can accommodate 150 passengers, 23 cars or two heavy-goods vehicles. She began service between Sconser on Skye and Raasay in the summer of 2013. A second hybrid ferry, MV Lochinvar, was launched in May 2013 and initially operated on the Tarbert (Loch Fyne) - Portavadie route, currently operating on the Lochaline - Fishnish route. A third, to be named MV Catriona, was launched in spring 2016 and operates on the Claonaig - Lochranza route, additionally to Tarbert (Loch Fyne) and Portavadie in the winter.


### Brodick terminal redevelopment

CMAL completed the redevelopment of Brodick ferry terminal. The redevelopment included an entirely new pier with linkspan and airbridge, a second berth with concrete ramp, a new two-storey terminal building with bus station and car marshalling space. The old linkspan was removed and the causeway transformed into an outdoor seating area.


### Sustainable ferries study

CMAL was commissioned to carry out a feasibility study for Scottish Enterprise to evaluate the technical and commercial possibilities of using hydrogen fuel cells to enable the development of zero-emission ferries. Along with Orkney Islands Council, Ballard Power Systems, Kongsberg Maritime and others, CMAL are part of the HySeas III consortium hoping to demonstrate that fuel cells can be integrated with a marine hybrid electric drive system. The project hopes to develop a vessel to operate between Kirkwall and Shapinsay. The project was completed in June 2022.


## Current projects


### Dual-fuel ferries

In September 2015, it was announced that CMAL would order two ferries from Ferguson Marine Engineering (FMEL). The vessels will be able to operate on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and marine diesel, future-proofing them for tighter sulphur emissions regulations. They will be the largest commercial vessels to be built on the Clyde since 2001. The first, named MV Glen Sannox, was due to enter service at Ardrossan in 2018, with the second, named MV Glen Rosa, following a few months later. Both vessels have been delayed, with the shipyard going into administration in August 2019. The 'ferry fiasco' is an ongoing political scandal in Scotland, exposing management failures across all parties involved.

MV Glen Sannox was handed over to CalMac on 21 November 2024, and is now undergoing crew familiarisation and harbour berthing trials. She is due to enter service on the Troon-Brodick route in early 2025. The expected delivery date for MV Glen Rosa is May 2025.


### LNG facilities

At Uig and Ardrossan for the dual-fuel vessels under construction.


### Small vessel replacement programme

This project is to replace the oldest of the Loch class, in two phases over ten years. The new vessels would be more environmentally friendly and meet higher regulatory standards. The first phase will be for the building of seven new vessels for the following routes. The procurement process began in July 2024, with an invitation to tender expected to be issued around September 2024, and a contract expected to be awarded in March 2025.

1. Colintraive – Rhubodach, replacing MV Loch Dunvegan
2. Sconser – Raasay, replacing MV Hallaig (to be cascaded, probably to Cumbrae, to replace MV Loch Riddon as second summer vessel, with a possibility for a higher passenger capacity)
3. Iona – Fionnphort, replacing MV Loch Buie
4. Tarbert (Loch Fyne) - Portavadie, replacing MV Isle of Cumbrae
5. Lochaline – Fishnish, replacing MV Lochinvar (to be cascaded elsewhere in the network)
6. Tobermory – Kilchoan, replacing MV Loch Tarbert
7. Tayinloan – Gigha, replacing MV Loch Ranza

The second phase began initial design and port feasibility studies in August 2024. The following routes are in scope for this phase:

1. Barra – Eriskay, replacing MV Loch Alainn
2. Berneray – Leverburgh, replacing MV Loch Portain
3. Mallaig – Armadale, replacing MV Loch Fyne

### New Islay ferries

This project is to replace MV Hebridean Isles and MV Finlaggan (to be cascaded elsewhere in the network). On 3 October 2022 the first steel was cut for the first vessel, named MV Isle of Islay*,* at Cemre Shipyard, Turkey. On the week of 13 January 2023 the first vessels' keel was laid and the second vessels' first steel was cut. Voting for the names of the two vessels was launched on 24 April 2023, where the public was asked to pick two names, with the following options:

* Isle of Islay—the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.
* Pioneer—a ferry built in 1974 serving West Loch Tarbert and Port Ellen on Islay. She was the longest vessel to operate this far up the loch.
* Loch Gruinart—a sea loch on the north coast of Islay.
* Loch Indaal—a sea loch south of Loch Gruinart, and inspiration for the folk song “The Lights of Lochindaal” by Iain Simpson.
* Laggan Bay—home to ‘The Big Strand’, a five-mile-long beach, located on the southeast entrance to Loch Indaal.
* Machir Bay—a small bay on the west coast of Islay.

The names MV Isle of Islay and MV Loch Indaal were selected. On 24 May 2023 the keel for *Loch Indaal* was laid. The vessels utilise Voith Schneider Propulsion and bow thrusters. *Isle of Islay* is expected to be delivered during the first quarter of 2025, with *Loch Indaal* expected to be delivered in the second quarter of the year.


### New Little Minch ferries

This project is to replace MV Hebrides (to be cascaded elsewhere in the network) and split the routes in the summer, having one vessel going to Lochmaddy and the other to Tarbert, giving more resilience to the fleet and the Outer Hebrides. The two vessels,will be of the same design as MV Isle of Islay and MV Loch Indaal. All four of these vessels will be built at the Cemre Shipyard in Turkey.

CMAL confirmed on 19 May 2023 that the first steel for the first vessel will be cut on 24 May 2023. On 20 September 2023, the keel was laid for the first vessel, while the first steel was cut for the second vessel. A public vote to select the names for the two vessels began on 30 November 2023, with voting closing at midnight on Monday 18th December. The names MV Claymore and MV Lochmor were selected: MV *Claymore* is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2025 with MV *Lochmor* expected to be delivered by the end of 2025.


### Gourock ferries and terminal redevelopment

Replacements for the three passenger-only fleet serving Dunoon and Kilcreggan. This project also includes the redevelopment of all three terminals and related infrastructure. This project is currently at the design phase, with construction due to begin in 2025/26.


### New Lochboisdale ferry and Gasay Ferry Terminal

A new vessel will be constructed to replace MV Lord of the Isles on the Mallaig-Lochboisdale (South Uist) service. This also includes a new terminal at Gasay, near Lochboisdale, as the current pier is getting to the end of its life. This project is currently at the design phase, and as of February 2024 a date for procurement was still to be confirmed.


### Future Mull ferries

The CMAL Corporate Plan for 2024-2027 envisages the start of the design phase for two new major units to replace MV Isle of Mull and MV Loch Frisa on the Oban-Craignure service. As of August 2024 this project had yet to commence.


## Criticism and Future

CMAL has come under significant criticism for its handling of procurement, particularly in relation to the building programme of MV Glen Sannox and MV Glen Rosa, both under construction at Ferguson Shipyard in Port Glasgow. The function and future of CMAL is currently under consideration by the Scottish Government via Project Neptune which is considering the management and delivery of Scottish ferry services. The future of CMAL is subject to a number of proposals being made including re-merging CMAL and Caledonian MacBrayne as was the case previously or indeed CMAL being absorbed into the function of Transport Scotland. A Scottish Parliament committee was critical of CMAL and ultimately has considered the proposals outlined in Project Neptune, recommending CMAL be abolished and a new public division of Transport Scotland established called Ferries Scotland. There have been numerous calls such as that from Kenny MacLeod, Chairman of Harris Development Trust, to scrap CMAL and reintegrate the organisation as an internal organ of Caledonian MacBrayne. These comments were also echoed in the media by the RMT Union. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
