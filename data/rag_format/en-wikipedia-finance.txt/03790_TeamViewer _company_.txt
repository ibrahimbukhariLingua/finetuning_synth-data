## History


### Start-up and growth phase

TeamViewer was founded following the release of the first version of the TeamViewer software in 2005. The TeamViewer software was developed to reduce travelling to customers. It became the core product of the newly founded *TeamViewer GmbH*, which today operates as *TeamViewer Germany GmbH a*nd belongs to TeamViewer SE. The company's business model allowed private users to use the software free of charge, while companies had to purchase a license.

In 2010, TeamViewer GmbH was acquired by GFI Software. In 2014, British private equity firm Permira acquired TeamViewer and helped the company develop an international customer base and expand the scope of its products.

### Initial public offering

From the beginning of 2018, the company changed its business model from the previous sale of licenses to subscriptions. This followed a general trend in the IT industry and helped TeamViewer to grow further. In preparation for an IPO, a new corporate structure was created in 2019.

With an issue volume of €2.2 billion, it was the largest IPO of a German technology company since 2000 and the largest IPO in Europe in 2019.
