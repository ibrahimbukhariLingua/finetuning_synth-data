## Career

Ba was a trainee inspector in Diourbel in 1989, then Chief Inspector of the first division of value-added tax at the General Directorate of Taxes and Estates (DGID) in Dakar. In 1991 he undertook further training at the Institut international d'administration publique in Paris and in Baltimore.

From 1990 to 1992, Ba was Head Inspector for Dakar-Plateau, then held the position of Controlling Commissioner of Insurance at the Directorate of Insurance until 1994, and then Verifying Inspector at the Directorate of Verification and Fiscal Investigations.

After more training in 2001 at the École nationale des impôts [fr] in Clermont-Ferrand, Ba became head of the Centre for Large Enterprises in the Directorate of Taxes in 2002. In 2004 he was Director of Taxes for a year. In November of the same year, he was named Director-General of Taxes and Estates. During his tenure, a new Code général des impôts [fr] was begun, which entered into force in January 2013.

Alongside these roles, Ba taught at ENAM in the taxes and estates department from 1992 and at COFEB/BCEAO from 1995 to 2000.

When Aminata Touré became prime minister on 2 September 2013, Ba was appointed Minister of Finance and Economy, replacing Amadou Kane. He retained this position when Mohammed Dionne took over as prime minister in 2014. He was appointed as prime minister by president Macky Sall on 17 September 2022, re-establishing the position of prime minister following its abolition in April 2019.


### Presidential campaign

On September 9, 2023, he was chosen by President Macky Sall to be the candidate of the United in Hope coalition for the 2024 presidential election.

Ba resigned as prime minister on 6 March 2024 to contest the election and sought to represent continuity and stability. He vowed to continue the legacy of Macky Sall with a positive investment climate and said a vote for him is a vote for "greater peace and prosperity". He hit out at opposition candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye and PASTEF leader Ousmane Sonko, saying their proposals are radical and labelling them "bandits". He argued his ministerial track record proves he will oversee development and create one million jobs in five years.
