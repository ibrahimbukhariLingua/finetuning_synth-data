### Adams Outdoor

Adams Outdoor was founded in 1983 with the acquisition of Central Outdoor Advertising, located in Michigan. Over the next five years, Adams pursued a rollup of billboard and other outdoor advertising assets into additional medium-sized markets, primarily through the acquisition of existing outdoor advertising businesses in selected midwest, southeast and mid-Atlantic states (examples being Central Outdoor in Michigan, Creative Displays in the Lehigh Valley, Schloss Outdoor in North Carolina, and Turner Outdoor in Atlanta, Georgia). Today the company is privately held, however in its final year of reporting public financials, 2000, the company had approximately $80 million of revenue.
