Quita Sueño Bank


# Quita Sueño Bank



**Quita Sueño Bank** (claimed as **Quitasueño**) is a reef formation of Colombia which was once claimed by the United States, located 110 km north-northeast of Providencia Island.


## History

In 1869, James Jennett claimed the bank for the United States under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. In 1972, the United States and Colombia signed a treaty (ratified in 1981) that abandoned the U.S. claim to the reef. Unlike some islands included in the treaty ceded to Colombia, the United States regarded Quita Sueño Bank as having no emergent land and thus ineligible for the basis of a sovereignty claim. Rather than being ceded to any particular nation, the claim was simply abandoned, and American fishing rights were retained. Colombia, which had also made previous claims on the reef, considers the bank to be a part of its San Andres and Providencia Department.

In the northern part of the eastern reef is Quita Sueño Light. The location is named *Cayo Quitasueño* on the official nautical chart at 14°28′57.2298″N 81°7′39.7632″W﻿ / ﻿14.482563833°N 81.127712000°W﻿ / 14.482563833; -81.127712000, but no emergent land is indicated around the lighthouse. The light is erected on top of a square platform. This lighthouse had originally been established by the United States in 1919. The current structure is from 1977. It is now called *Faro Quitasueño Norte* since in 2008, a second lighthouse *Faro Quitasueño Sur* was established in the southern part of the reef at 14°09′17″N 81°9′40″W﻿ / ﻿14.15472°N 81.16111°W﻿ / 14.15472; -81.16111.

Nicaragua also had a claim to the bank. On November 19, 2012, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled the bank is a part of Colombia. The ICJ found that only one of the 54 features identified by Nicaragua in Quitasueño is an island at high tide and thus eligible for a sovereignty claim.
