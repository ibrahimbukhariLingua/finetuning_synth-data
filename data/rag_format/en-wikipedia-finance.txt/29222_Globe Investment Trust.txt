Globe Investment Trust


# Globe Investment Trust



**The Globe Investment Trust plc** was a very large British investment trust. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The trust's portfolio included a mix of large, medium, and small-cap stocks across a range of sectors and regions. It was suitable for investors who are looking for international diversification and a long-term investment horizon.


## History

The Company was founded in 1873 as an investment trust dedicated to international equities. It was managed by Charterhouse Group.

In July 1990 the British Coal Pension Fund launched a hostile and ultimately successful takeover bid paying Â£1.1bn for what was at the time the United Kingdom's largest investment trust.
