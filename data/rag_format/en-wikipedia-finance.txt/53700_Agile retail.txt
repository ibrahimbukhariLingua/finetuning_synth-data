## History

The Agile ideology can be traced back to the Lean manufacturing principles developed at Toyota in the 1950s. Lean manufacturing focuses on eliminating waste in the manufacturing process. The basic intention is to maximize efficiency during manufacturing with a view to enhance productivity and lower costs. Back then, the Agile retail concept was applied mainly to the manufacturing of hard goods such as automobiles.

In recent years Agile retail, especially in the fashion industry, capitalizes on many of the principles that have made other stalwart tech companies successful in their respective industries.

In a traditional fashion company, a designer creates an entire collection usually based on his or her inspiration. The Germany-based online retailer Lesara has been using the concept of agile retail in the fashion industry.
