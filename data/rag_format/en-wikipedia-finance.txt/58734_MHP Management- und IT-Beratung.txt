# MHP Management- und IT-Beratung



**MHP Management- und IT-Beratung** (MHP) is a global consultancy based in Ludwigsburg, Germany, specializing in IT and process consulting in the automotive and manufacturing sectors. Porsche has held an equity stake in the firm since 1999, starting at 49% and increasing over time to the current 100%. MHP has experienced sustained growth since its inception in 1996.


## History

The firm was initially established in May 1996 by Ralf Hofmann and Lutz Mieschke. The idea was to provide consulting services combining both business process optimization as well as IT services, with SAP software being the primary concentration of the IT services offering. In January 1999, Porsche AG began its equity investment at 49% and MHP became their primary IT service partner. At this point the company is known as "MHP - A Porsche Services Company". In March 2002, Porsche increased its stake to 51% and MHP became a subsidiary of Porsche AG. In June 2003, Porsche further increased its investment to 74.8% and once again in 2011 to 81.8% and in 2023 to 100%. CEO Dr.-Ing Hofmann sold the remaining 18.2% ownership stake to Porsche in 2023.
