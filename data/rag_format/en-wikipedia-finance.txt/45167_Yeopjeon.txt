Yeopjeon


# Yeopjeon



A ***yeopjeon*** (Korean: 엽전; Hanja: 葉錢; "leaf coin") was a Korean brass coin with a square cut out which was first issued in 1678 and continued until the final years of the Chosun Dynasty. Coins with a similar design had been unsuccessfully used during the earlier Goryeo period as well.

The Sangpyeong Tongbo [ko] (常平通寶) cash coins were known as *yeopjeon* because of the way that these cash coins resembled leaves on a branch when they were being cast in the casting mould. In the western world all coins with this design are commonly called "cash coins".

In 1908 the value of a *yeopjeon* was set at 0.2 chon (or 1⁄500 won).


## Modern influence

* At the Tong-in Market (통인시장), a small market that was established in 1941 during the Japanese occupation period for Seoul's Japanese residents outside of the Gyeongbok Palace, people can purchase token coins shaped like *yeopjeon* at shops which are members of the "Dosirak Café" (도시락) project to spend at around 70 food stores and restaurants. The shops where these *yeopjeon* tokens can be spend have a sign stating "通 도시락 cafe" and these tokens can be bought in strings of 10 *yeopjeon*. A single one of these *yeopjeon* tokens cost ₩500 in 2014.
