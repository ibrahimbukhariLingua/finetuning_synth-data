**Wafi Energy Pakistan Limited**, doing business as **Shell**, is a Pakistani oil marketing company based in Karachi. It is a subsidiary of Wafi Energy Holding, a Saudi Arabian oil and gas company. Previously, it was a part of Shell plc.


## History

Wafi Energy Pakistan's origins date back to 1899 with the establishment of Asiatic Petroleum, a joint venture between Shell Transport Company and Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, which initiated kerosene oil imports from Azerbaijan into the region. A significant historical marker from this period is a storage tank from 1898. The company's documented presence in the Indian subcontinent began in 1903 when The Shell Transport & Trading Company and the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company formed a partnership to supply petroleum to Asia.

In 1928, Royal Dutch Shell merged its marketing interests in India with those of Burmah Oil Company Limited, creating the Burman Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Company of India.

After Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the company was renamed as Burmah Shell Oil Distribution Company of Pakistan.

During the 1950s, Shell Pakistan, then known as Burman Shell, employed notable strategies for promoting kerosene oil, featuring popular singers such as Mohammed Rafi in their advertisements.

In 1965, Shell sold half of its stake in Burman Shell operating in East Pakistan. Later, a new company was formed for East Pakistan named Burman Eastern Limited which was listed on the stock exchange and the majority of its shareholding was held by Pakistanis.

In 1970, it was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange and the company was renamed as Pakistan Burmah Shell (PBS) Limited. The Shell and Burman Groups retained a 49 percent share, split evenly while National Investment Trust, a state-owned fund, owned a majority stake.

In February 1993, during a period of economic liberalization, Burmah divested from PBS, allowing Shell Petroleum to increase its stake to 51 percent. Over time, Shell Petroleum further increased its share to 77.42 percent in the early 2000s. In 2024, Asyad Holding, a Saudi based group through UAE-based Wafi Energy Holding Limited acquired 77.42 percent shareholdings and control of Shell Pakistan Limited.
