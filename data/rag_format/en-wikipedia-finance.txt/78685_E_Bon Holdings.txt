## History

In 1976, the first retail shop 'Sunny' was established at Lockhart Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong, mainly selling imported ceramic tiles and subsequently architectural hardware to retail customers. As growing in scale, E. Bon acquired an office at First Commercial Building, Causeway Bay in 1981 and later a warehouse in Aberdeen in the 1980s.

In the early 1990s, E. Bon established showrooms in Macau, Richmond, Beijing, Taipei, Shanghai and Shantou to seek international opportunities, and has eventually become one of the leaders in the industry after years of development. To enhance competitiveness, the Group launched modernisation programmes and intended an Initial Public Offer in the early 2000s for better corporate governance.

On 12 April 2000, the holding company of the Group, E. Bon Holdings Limited, was officially listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited.
