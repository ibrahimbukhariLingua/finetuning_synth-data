# Swappie



**Swappie** is a Finland based startup that buys, refurbishes, and resells iPhones. The company was founded in 2016 and is active across Europe.


## Business model and company structure

The company buys, inspects, refurbishes and resells used iPhones with a warranty of 12 to 36 month. According to CNN, the company is taking up ideas from the right to repair movement in this way.

The used devices are bought directly from end consumers (C2B), Swappie also buys iPhones from companies (business phones) or from intermediaries (B2B). In some cities there are devices that work like reverse vending machines. People can drop in their used iPhones and have them valued. If the price offered is accepted, Swappie transfers the money to the seller's bank account. In Sweden, Swappie has set up such devices in ICA branches, for example in Stockholm, Uppsala, Sundsvall, Helsingborg or Malmö.

The inspection and refurbishing process consists of more than 50 steps. It is carried out in two workshops located in Helsinki and Tallinn (Estonia) respectively. The company headquarters is also located in Helsinki. The fulfillment for Central Europe is handled in Leipzig, Germany.

The company is active across Europe. Finland, Sweden, Italy and Germany are considered the company's largest markets. Competitors differ from country to country. They include, for example *Refurbed*, *Back Market*, *Mint+*, Telia and Apple's own refurbed online store.

Swappie focuses its business exclusively on iPhones.
