Industry of Iran


# Industry of Iran



According to a report by *The Economist*, Iran has been ranked 39th for producing $23 billion of industrial products in 2008. From 2008 to 2009 Iran has leaped to 28th place from 69th place in annual industrial production growth rate.

The government of Iran has plans for the establishment of 50–60 industrial parks by the end of the fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan by 2015. Iranian contractors have been awarded several foreign tender contracts in different fields of construction of dams, bridges, roads, buildings, railroads, power generation, and gas, oil and petrochemical industries. As of 2011, some 66 Iranian industrial companies are carrying out projects in 27 countries. Iran has exported over $20 billion worth of technical and engineering services over 2001–2011. The availability of local raw materials, rich mineral reserves, experienced manpower have all collectively played crucial role in winning the international bids.


## Ministry of Industries and Mines

Ministry of Industries and Mines is in charge of facilitating the expansion and promotion of industrial and mineral policies. The Ministry is also in charge of centralization and integration of policy making in the industrial and mining sector. Finally, this Ministry regulates all strategies, policies and plans relevant to the industrial and mining sector in Iran. The Department for High Technology Industries, also known as the High Tech Industries Centre (HTIC) is active in promoting research activities and in supporting the emergence of high tech firms. As of 2014, Iran has 930 industrial parks and zones.


### Small and medium enterprises

As of 2014, 81,000 small industrial units employed more than 1 million workers in Iran. Small industries constitute 92 percent of Iranian industries, 45 percent of the country's industrial employment, and 17 percent of the country's production. In Iran, because of its weakness or absence, the support industry makes little contribution to the innovation/technology development activities. Supporting the development of small and medium enterprises will strengthen greatly the supplier network in Iran. Difficulty in accessing financing is also a major concern for small and medium enterprises. In 2016, Iran had nearly 3,000 knowledge-based firms accounting for 70,000 jobs and $6.6 billion in revenue.

As of 2019, 43,650 SMEs were based in over 800 industrial parks in Iran, of which nearly 78 percent or 33,800 were active (1,100 of those SMEs are exporting domestic products to global markets).

A 2003-report made by United Nations Industrial Development Organization regarding the state of SME's in Iran identified these causes as the ones impeding Iran's industrial development: lack of monitoring institutions, inefficient banking system, lack of sufficient R&D, shortage of managerial skills, corruption, inefficient taxation, socio-cultural apprehensions, absence of social learning loops, lack of familiarity with international markets necessary for global competition, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, shortage of skilled labor, lack of intellectual property protection, shortage of research centers, lack of social capital, social learning, social responsibility and socio-cultural values.

Despite these problems, recent studiesᵇʸ ʷʰᵒᵐ? reveal that over the past few yearsʷʰᵉⁿ? Iran has progressed rapidly in various scientific and technological fields. Major advancements have taken place in the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aerospace, defense, and heavy industry sectors. Even in the face of U.S. economic sanctions, Iran appears to be emerging as an industrialized country.


## Production statistics

Tehran is the economic centre of Iran. About 30% of Iran's public-sector workforce and 45% of large industrial firms are located in Tehran and almost half of these workers work for the government.

## Food industry

The sector also employs approximately 328,000 people or 16.1% of the entire industry sector's workforce. Iran exported $736 million worth of foodstuffs in 2007 and $1 billion (~600,000 tonnes) in 2010. Soft drinks, mineral water, biscuit, chocolate, confection, edible oil, dairies, conserved foods and fruits, jam and jelly, macaroni, fruit juice and yeast were among the main exports to Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and other Central Asian countries, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Syria, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Canada, Venezuela, Japan, South Korea and Turkey. As of 2015, Swiss-based Buhler Group is a leading supplier of industrial equipment to Iran's food industry.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Retail industry

At present the Iranian retail industry is largely in the hands of cooperatives, many of them government-sponsored, and of independent retailers in the bazaars. The bulk of food sales occur at street markets, where the Chief Statistics Bureau sets the prices.

Behpakhsh Co., Golrang Pakhsh and Ghasem Iran are the largest distribution companies in Iran. Ghasem provides more than 80,000 retailers with their requirements of consumer goods within the territories of Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

Iran has 438,478 small grocery retailers. These are especially popular in cities other than Tehran where the number of hypermarkets and supermarkets is still very limited. More mini-markets and supermarkets are emerging, but these are mostly one-off, independently owned operations. The most significant chains are the state-owned *Etka*, *Refah*, *Shahrvand* and Carrefour-owned Hyperstar Market, all of which are gearing up for expansion. Migros Turk has also announced that it intends to invest in Iran's lucrative retail market. In 2010, a state-linked technology group (the Rouyesh Technical Centre) established the country's first online supermarket.

Imports still account for a considerable proportion of consumer goods consumption in Iran, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates-based companies meet much of the demand; they re-export from Western and Asian countries, making Iran the UAE's most important re-export market. In 2012, Iranians spent $77 billion on food, $22 billion on clothes and $18.5 billion on outward tourism. In 2015, overall consumer expenditures and disposable income are respectively projected to be $176.4 billion and $287 billion.

Before the revolution in 1979, Iran was a major importer of Western apparel and foreign-manufactured consumer goods. Even now Iran is no stranger to Western retail influences, with numerous brands and goods available in shopping centers and outlets on Kish Island. Latest major shopping centers constructed in Iran as of 2017 are:

1. Isfahan City Center (5 million square feet) with 750 units;
2. Persian Gulf Complex (4.8 million square feet) with 2,500 units;
3. Iran Mall (21
4. million square feet);
5. Tehran Mall (1.6 million square feet) with 500 units;
6. Atlas Mall (1.5 million square feet) with 308 units;
7. Palladium Mall (1.1 million square feet) with 105 units;
8. Laleh Park Shopping Center (985,000 square feet) with 126 units;
9. Arg Complex (840,000 square feet) with 200 units;
10. Oxin City Center (540,000 square feet) with 100 units.

The Supreme Leader of Iran has repeatedly urged Iranians to consume more domestically produced goods over imported ones to support the resistance economy and import substitution industrialization.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Hamshahri and Donya-e-Eqtesad newspapers and Movafaqiyat magazine were selected as the best press.


## Automotive industry

Iran's automotive industry is the second most active industry of the country, after its oil and gas industry. Iran's automobile production crossed the 1 million mark in 2005. Iran Khodro is the largest car manufacturer in the Middle-East and also tractor sazi Tabriz is biggest tractor manufacturer

in middlest . It has established joint-ventures with foreign partners on 4 continents. Iran is the 12th largest automaker in the world.


## Defense industry

The Iranian defense industry has taken great strides in the past 25 years, and now manufactures many types of arms and equipment, including its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, guided missiles, radar systems, guided missile destroyer, military vessels, submarines, and a fighter plane. According to Iranian officials, the country sold $100 million worth of military equipment in 2003, including NATO members, and as of 2006 had exported weapons to 57 countries.

In a conference, Iran's Deputy Minister of Defense said: Iran's military products exports from March 2022 to March 2023 have reached about one billion dollars.


## Construction industry

Construction is one of the most important sectors in Iran accounting for 20–50% of the total private investment. The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes. The housing industry is one of the few segments of the Iranian economy where state capital shares as little as two per cent of the market, and the remaining 98 per cent is private sector investment. There is little red tape or hurdles and, as a result, through launching mass development projects, the use of new technologies and fast-pace project execution, a larger portion of the housing market is accessible.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This is also true for new construction materials and technological advances.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Mining and metals

Iran is one of the most important mineral producers in the world, ranked among 15 major mineral-rich countries. The country holds 68 types of minerals, including chrome, lead, zinc, copper, coal, gold, tin and iron.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Textiles and apparel industry

Textile mills, based on domestic cotton and wool such as *Tehran Patou* and *Iran Termeh*, among others, employed about 400,000 people in 2000 and are centered in Tehran, Isfahan and along the Caspian coast. Iran, with a population of 70 million, requires 1.4 billion square meters of textiles annually. Overseas companies smuggle illegal textiles and apparel into Iran at a rate that is decimating Iran textile manufacturers and costing Iranian jobs. The annual textile production has been restricted to 800 million square meters.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
