1st BRIC summit


# 1st BRIC summit



The inaugural **BRIC summit** took place in Yekaterinburg, Russia on June 16, 2009. The four heads of government from the BRIC countries attended.


## Overview

The acronym **BRIC** (for **B**razil, **R**ussia, **I**ndia, **C**hina) was first used in a Goldman Sachs thesis projecting that the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China is such that they may become among the five most dominant economies by the year 2050. Today, the four countries produce about 15 percent of the world’s gross domestic product and hold about 40 percent of the gold and hard currency reserves.

Political dialogue between the BRIC countries began in New York in September 2006, with a meeting of the BRIC foreign ministers. Four high-level meetings have followed, including a full-scale meeting in Yekaterinburg, Russia, on May 16, 2008.
