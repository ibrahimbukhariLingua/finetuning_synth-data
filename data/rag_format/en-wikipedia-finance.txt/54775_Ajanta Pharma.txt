### History

In the early 2000s, Ajanta was noted as a major source of foreign currency, alongside Reddy Labs, arising from sales in Southeast Asia. In particular, in 2003, a joint-venture between Ajanta and the Ministry of Health in Turkmenistan accounted for fully half of the pharmaceutical needs of the country. The company had made several other joint-ventures with regional governments, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrygyzstan and Tajikistan, which it severed in the 2010s due to their being unprofitable.

The company experienced an enormous loss in 2005 in terms of diminution of the value of investments, amounting to four times the year's profits. That same year, the company was noted as having the highest sales in India for any Indian pharmaceutical company, with sales of â‚¹13.56 billion.

In 2015, the company was highlighted as having had exceptional stock appreciation over the preceding four years, and the listing of the stock on the BSE 500 was noted. By 2019, the stock was listed on the S&P BSE 200 index.


## Manufacturing facilities

Ajanta Pharma operates seven manufacturing facilities in India. Six facilities manufacture finished formulations, including Dahej and Paithan plants which is approved by the US FDA and Guwahati plant which caters to domestic and emerging markets. Another plant manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) primarily for captive consumption.


## Legal proceedings

Bayer filed suit before the Delhi High Court accusing Ajanta of patent infringement on the erectile dysfunction treatments vardenafil and vardenafil hydrochloride. Ajanta argued that Bayer was not using its patent in India for the benefit of India, which led the court to provide partial relief to an injunction granted to Bayer, allowing Ajanta to manufacture but not sell the product, in January 2017. Bayer and Ajanta reached an unspecified agreement after mediation was ordered by the court in February 2017.
