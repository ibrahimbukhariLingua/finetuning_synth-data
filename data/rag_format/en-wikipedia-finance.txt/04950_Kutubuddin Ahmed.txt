## Early life and education

Ahmed was born on 21 January 1956 in Dhaka. He graduated in mechanical engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).


## Business career

Ahmed began his career at Janata Bank, but resigned in 1983 to start his own business. Raising the BDT 10 lakh (US$37,500 in 1984) initial capital for what is now known as the Envoy Group proved difficult. In the end, Ahmed took out a bank loan with his father's house as collateral and brought in a partner, Abdus Salam Murshedy, a striker for Mohammedan Sporting Club who had gained fame in 1982 by scoring a league-record 27 goals, but who had no previous business experience.

In 1984, the partners set up a small factory in the Khilgaon Thana area of Dhaka, equipped it with 46 sewing machines, and hired 200 garment workers. Initially the company sub-contracted for other garment manufacturers. They were early participants in a sector that would become a powerhouse of the Bangladesh economy, but orders were sporadic at first, and the factory was idle for long spells. Sometimes they had to borrow from banks to meet payroll. The turning point came when they received their first order as a primary contractor, 6,500 trousers for a Swedish retailer.

The agent who placed the order was impressed with their work and directed more business their way. In the next 16 months, Envoy Group recorded a BDT 1 crore (US$385,000 in 1985) profit. They paid off their debt and bought two more garment factories, building on the experience gained running their first.

Through expansion, by attracting investment and purchasing existing businesses, Ahmed led the company as it grew over the years into a large manufacturing and exporting group.

Ahmed completed a term as president in Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), Dhaka and Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers & Exporters Association (BGMEA) in 2001 and 2002.

He received the "Arthakantha Business Award-2002" by a national financial fortnightly of Bangladesh. He served as president (2004–2005) of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), Dhaka, Bangladesh He received an outstanding achievement award from International Islamic University Chittagong in 2008.

In 2014, Envoy Group had grown to include manufacturers and exporters garments, textiles, real estate, freight forwarding, information technology and computer systems operations. At that time the company was employing about 20,000 people, and had received several awards, including the President's Export Trophy, and the National Export Trophy. In 2015, Ahmed was named a "commercially important person" by the government of Bangladesh.
