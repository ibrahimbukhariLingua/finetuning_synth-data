# Centre of Planning and Economic Research



The **Centre of Planning and Economic Research** (KEPE) was established in 1959 as a research unit, under the title "Centre for Economic Research", to study the challenges faced by the Greek economy and encourage economic research in Greece and further cooperation with other scientific institutions.


## History

In 1964, KEPE acquired its present name and organizational structure along with the additional charges of preparing development plans, analyzing contemporary developments in the Greek economy, engaging in short and medium-term forecasts, formulating proposals for development policies and training young economists in the fields of planning and economic development.

Today, KEPE is a leading economics research institute in Greece. It focuses on applied research projects concerning the Greek economy, and provides expert advice to the Greek government on economic and social policy issues. In April 2019, the Greek government formally appointed KEPE as the National Productivity Board for Greece.


## Board of Directors & Research Fellows

KEPE is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Development and Competitiveness.
Research Fellows at KEPE concentrate on four areas of empirical research: (a) macroeconomic analysis and projections, (b) fiscal and monetary policy, (c) human resources and social policies, and (d) sectoral analysis and policy.
