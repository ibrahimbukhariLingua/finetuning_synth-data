## History

The company was founded by Dr. Steven Ritter, William S. Hadley, John R. Anderson, and Kenneth Koedinger, researchers in cognitive science, computer science, and education, in 1998 as a research project at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

Carnegie Learning's initial focus was on developing intelligent tutoring systems for mathematics education, leveraging cognitive science and computer technology to provide personalized and adaptive learning experiences for students. Their work was influenced by research on cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and education.

The company gained recognition for its innovative approach to math education and its use of technology to enhance learning outcomes. Over the years, Carnegie Learning has expanded its offerings and now provides comprehensive math curricula for schools, blending traditional classroom instruction with technology-based resources and assessments.

As the company has expanded, its K-12 education portfolio has extended beyond math and now includes ELA, world languages, professional learning, and tutoring.
