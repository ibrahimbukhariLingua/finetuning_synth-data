## History

In 1957, the company was founded in Milwaukee by Max H. Karl, a real estate attorney who noticed that his clients were having trouble paying for their new homes. Karl invented modern private mortgage insurance and secured US$250,000 from investors, including friends and business associates, to open MGIC. In 1982, Karl sold the company to Baldwin United for $1.2 billion. In 1983 Baldwin United filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and in 1985 MGIC was liquidated and its assets sold to Northwestern Mutual for $775 million. That same year, Karl and others set up a new company with the same name. In 1987, Bill Lacy was appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the company. Lacy died in 2016. In 1995, the founder of the company, Max H. Karl, died.

MGIC's four-story headquarters is located at 250 Kilbourn Avenue in downtown Milwaukee.
