## Early life and education

He was born on April 16, 1862, to John Baxter Barbour Sr. and Isabella F. McKelvy in Pittsburgh.

## Business career


### Stocks and exchanges

After learning stenography, in the spring of 1881 he became bookkeeper for Thomas J. Watson, at that time the leading oil broker in Pittsburgh. While the speculative craze in oil was at its height during 1882 and after this time, Barbour was at the head of the office affairs for Watson, and it is due to his clear- headed judgment that important enterprises were carried to a successful issue. Subsequently, he formed a connection with another broker, James S. McKelvy, with whom he remained until January i, 1890. He then became the local exchange representative of Rea Brothers & Company, stock and grain brokers, and upon their retirement in 1892 Barbour succeeded to their business. The business was a general one in stocks, bonds and grain, and Barbour made a specialty of local and investment securities.


### Oil Exchange

So pronounced and widely recognized was the business and executive ability of Barbour, that he was honored with election to membership in the old Oil Exchange when he was but nineteen years of age. and he is now one of the oldest members of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, of which he was one of the organizers and a charter member. He was its first secretary and treasurer, and served one term as vice-president. Later Barbour served five successive terms as treasurer, and after that served three terms as vice-president and then became president in 191 1, and later declined reelection on account of ill health. He was for several years director and chairman of the two most important of its committees, namely, on securities and law and offenses, and on May 3, 1916, was again elected president. As a representative of James S. McKelvy at the time of the great Penn Bank Syndicate in 1883-84, Barbour was a member of the New York Petroleum Exchange. As treasurer of the Pittsburgh Petroleum, Stock and Metal Exchange he served two terms.

At the time of his death, he was a member of the John B. Barbour Investment and Security Company.


## Political career

Until the James G. Blaine campaign of 1884 Barbour was a staunch supporter of Democratic principles. At that time, however, he became convinced that the country was in better hands when the Republican party held the reins, and he transferred his allegiance, in which he has never wavered, to that party. He has served as delegate to a number of conventions.
