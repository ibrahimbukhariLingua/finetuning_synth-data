# Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry



The **Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry** (**SCCCI**; traditional Chinese: 新加坡中華總商會; simplified Chinese: 新加坡中华总商会; pinyin: *Xīnjīapō Zhōnghuá Zǒngshānghuì*) is a business chamber located in Singapore.

The chamber was originally created to protect and promote the commercial interests of the Chinese community in Singapore, but it also played a role in the social, cultural and educational spheres to protect Chinese customs and values. It has raised funds to build schools and provided assistance to the community in times of crisis.

The organization has a membership of more than 4,000 companies and over 150 trade associations in Singapore as of 2016.


## History

The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) was first established in 1906 as the **General Chinese Trade Affairs Association** by prominent members of the Chinese community. Its original purpose was to look after the trading interests of the Chinese business community, resolve and mitigate differences among the different clans and champion the Chinese community in Singapore. The first president was Goh Siew Tin.

In 1912, it was renamed as **Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce** when the Republic of China was formed.

In 1951, the chamber lobbied the British colonial government to grant citizenship to Chinese immigrants who had stayed in Singapore for eight years and in 1957, the government approved the proposal.

In February 1962, remains belonging to civilian victims of the Japanese occupation were unearthed in areas like Siglap, Changi and Bukit Timah. The chamber undertook the responsibility of gathering the remains. It also helped in establishing the Civilian War Memorial at Beach Road in 1967.

In 1962, the Chamber started constructing their building at Hill Street and the building was officially opened on 20 September 1964 by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

In 1966, the Chamber set up the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce Foundation to provide financial assistance to the needy and scholarships to deserving students, and to support cultural activities and public educational political campaigns.

In 1977, it added the “& Industry” to its original name as “Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry”, to reflect its expanded scope of both commerce and industry.

In 1991, the SCCCI organised and held the inaugural World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention (WCEC) in Singapore which was attended by more than 700 delegates from 30 countries.

During the second WCEC in 1993, Singapore's prime minister Lee Kuan Yew suggested an Internet enabled network of ethnic Chinese businesses worldwide accessible to the various Chinese chambers of commerce in the world. With the help of Institute of Systems Science and Netcentre and a financial grant from the National Science and Technology Board, the SCCCI created the World Chinese Business Network (WCBN). The WCBN was launched on 8 December 1995.
