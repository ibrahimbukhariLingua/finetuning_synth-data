In September 2005, Connaughton was appointed by Governor Mitt Romney to the board of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.

In January 2010, Connaughton announced the commencement of her campaign for Massachusetts State Auditor as the Republican candidate. The seat was to be vacated by Joe DeNucci (D), who announced he would retire at the end of his term.
