**The Information and Communications Technology Council** was founded in 1992 as the Software Human Resources Council one of 31 sector councils funded in part by the Government of Canada's Sector Council Program.

Over the years the Software Human Resources Council evolved, and once the Canadian Government began to stop funding the sector councils, the organization re-branded to become the Information and Communications Technology Council.
