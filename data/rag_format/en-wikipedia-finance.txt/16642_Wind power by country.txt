Wind power by country


# Wind power by country



The worldwide total cumulative installed electricity generation capacity from wind power has increased rapidly since the start of the third millennium, and as of the end of 2023, it amounts to over 1000 GW. Since 2010, more than half of all new wind power was added outside the traditional markets of Europe and North America, mainly driven by the continuing boom in China and India. China alone had over 40% of the world's capacity in 2023.

Wind power is used on a commercial basis in more than half of all the countries of the world. Denmark produced 58% of its electricity from wind in 2023, a larger share than any other country. Latvia's wind capacity grew by 75%, the largest percent increase in 2022.

In November 2018, wind power generation in Scotland was higher than the country's electricity consumption during the month. Wind power's share of worldwide electricity usage in 2023 was 7.8%, up from 7.3% from the prior year. In Europe, wind was 12.3% of generation in 2023. In 2018, upcoming wind power markets rose from 8% to 10% across the Middle East, Latin America, South East Asia, and Africa.


## Generation by country

The following table lists these data for each country:

* total generation from wind in terawatt-hours,
* percent of that country's generation that was wind,
* total wind capacity in gigawatts,
* percent growth in wind capacity, and
* the wind capacity factor for that year.

Data are sourced from Ember and refer to the year 2023 unless otherwise specified. The table only includes countries with more than 0.1Â TWh of generation.
