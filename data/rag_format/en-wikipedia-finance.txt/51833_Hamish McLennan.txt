## Rugby Australia

In May 2020, it was announced that McLennan would join the board of Rugby Australia and would assume the role of chair. In November 2021, under McLennan's guidance, Australia was named the preferred host for the 2027 Rugby World Cup.

In June 2022, New Zealand news website Stuff described McLennan as the "pantomime villain who understands where NZ Rugby's faultlines lie", amid heightened tensions between NZ Rugby and RA. "McLennan has a singular focus on getting the best financial return for Rugby Australia. That’s it – that’s the game," according to the article. "He can be charming, erudite and interesting, but there is clearly a huge drive to win that means some people get run over along the way. For a NZ Rugby that is starting to find its feet but has had a rocky year or two, he’s an adversary they could do without."

In January 2023, with less than eight months until the 2023 Rugby World Cup, McLennan made the call to sack coach Dave Rennie, who still had a year left on his contract, and replace him with recently sacked England coach Eddie Jones. At the World Cup Australia was eliminated in the first round, their worst ever result at a World Cup, and on 29 October 2023 Jones resigned as coach of Australia.

On 29 November 2023, McLennan was sacked as chairman of Rugby Australia. He subsequently resigned from the board, and was replaced by Daniel Herbert.
