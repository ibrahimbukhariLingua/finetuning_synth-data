Pricing schedule


# Pricing schedule



A **pricing schedule** is a function that maps the quantity of a good purchased to the total price paid.


## Types of pricing schedules

* **Linear Pricing Schedule** - A pricing schedule in which there is a fixed price per unit, such that where total price paid is represented by *T(q)*, quantity is represented by *q* and price per unit is represented by a constant *p*, T(q) = pq
* **Nonlinear Pricing Schedule** - Nonlinear pricing is a pricing schedule in which quantity and total price are not mapped to each other in a strictly linear fashion
 + **Affine Pricing** - An affine pricing schedule consists of both a fixed cost and a cost per unit. Using the same notation as above, T(q) = k + pq, where k is a constant cost.
