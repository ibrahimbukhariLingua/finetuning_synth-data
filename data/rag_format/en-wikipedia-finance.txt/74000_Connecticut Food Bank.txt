Connecticut Food Bank


# Connecticut Food Bank



**Connecticut Foodshare** is a nonprofit organization based in Wallingford, Connecticut. It serves as the sole food bank for all of Connecticut.

As a member of Feeding America, Connecticut Foodshare secures food donations from a national and regional network of food donors, retail partners, manufacturers, wholesalers and farms. Connecticut Foodshare supplies food to a network of local agencies and programs (such as soup kitchens, food pantries, and emergency shelters). It serves more than 380,000 Connecticut residents (1 in 10) who struggle with hunger.

Business.org ranks Connecticut Foodshare as the "Best Charity for Your Money in Connecticut" based on an analysis of data collected by organizations in every state by Charity Navigator.


## History and Merge

The organization that is now Connecticut Foodshare started in 1982, when Mark Patten, a volunteer at Community Soup Kitchen in New Haven launched Connecticut Food Bank with a desk and chair supplied by Christian Community Action. It became an affiliate of Feeding America (then called America's Second Harvest) two years later.

On Jan. 27, 2021, the Wallingford-based Connecticut Food Bank merged with the Bloomfield, CT-based Foodshare, Inc. The new entity was renamed Connecticut Foodshare. Board of directors for each organization voted to approve the merge after Connecticut Food Bankâ€™s chief executive, Valarie Shultz-Wilson, left her job in February 2020 and the position remained unfilled for several months. As of early 2021, Connecticut Foodshare had 115 paid employees, a $110 million annual budget, and more than 8,000 volunteers. Its headquarters is in Wallingford, CT.


## Leadership

Connecticut Foodshare is led by Jason Jakubowski, a veteran nonprofit executive and a nationally recognized community leader. Jakubowski has been the President & CEO of Connecticut Foodshare since the two organizations merged in January of 2021. Before joining Connecticut Foodshare, Jakubowski was Vice President of External Relations at the Hospital for Special Care, and Director of Corporate & Community Development at Charter Oak State College.

Jakobowski has been a vocal advocate for increased state funding for nonprofit organizations. While on the NBC Connecticut program *Face the Facts* in February of 2024, he said many Connecticut nonprofits are still reeling from approximately 15 years of flat funding. At the same time, families who can no longer avail themselves of the enhancements offered during the pandemic are struggling in the faces of inflation and high prices. "They just can't find a way to make ends meet," he said.


## Programs


### Statewide Food Distribution

According to the Candid database (formerly Guidestar), Connecticut Foodshare distributed enough food in 2022 to provide nearly 37 million meals to its constituents.


### Mobile Food Pantry

The Mobile Pantry program aids underserved communities, including those in "food deserts," by delivering food to those most vulnerable. These individuals may lack direct access to a supermarket or food pantry, or they might face challenges in reaching resources outside of their neighborhood due to a lack of transportation or physical limitations. With over 100 locations across Connecticut, Mobile Pantries offer produce and shelf-stable items, serving as a vital resource for thousands of community members.


### SNAP Assistance

Connecticut Foodshare provides state residents with assistance in applying for the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). Increasing SNAP enrollment affords community members the ability to choose their own groceries at the store and reduces reliance on food assistance from charitable sources.


### Retail Rescue

Connecticut Foodshare works with more than 300 food retailers to arrange food donations to nearby food pantries. The program helps build local relationships and allows the organization to more efficiently use its trucks and warehouse space.


### "Thanksgiving For All" Turkey Giveaway

In November of 2023, Connecticut Foodshare announced that it planned to provide 50,000 turkeys to people in need in Connecticut. "We're seeing longer lines than we've seen in a long time at our pantries and mobile sites," CEO Jason Jakubowski told CT Insider.


## UConn Support

In September of 2023, University of Connecticut basketball star Paige Bueckers teamed up with education company Chegg to donate $50,000 to the Connecticut Foodshare-affiliated pantry located on the UConn campus.
