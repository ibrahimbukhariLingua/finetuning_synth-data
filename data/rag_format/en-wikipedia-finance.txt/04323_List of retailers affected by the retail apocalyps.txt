# List of retailers affected by the retail apocalypse



The following retailers have all either closed or announced plans to close large numbers of retail locations, since 2010, during a time period labelled a "retail apocalypse" by media, accelerated by both the increase in online shopping and then by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Retailers 0-9

* 7-Eleven closed 444 stores in 2024, indicating that the decline in business was due to slower foot traffic as consumers skipped on discretionary purchases.
* 99 Cents Only Stores announced on April 4, 2024 that its 371 locations in the Western United States would begin to close. The COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and shrink were cited as major reasons for the closure. The company had considered filing for bankruptcy prior to the announcement. Later, in May 2024, it was reported that Dollar Tree had acquired the leases of at least 170 former 99 Cents Only Stores locations, which would reopen as Dollar Tree stores beginning in the fall of the same year.

* Bebe announced plans to close all stores and focus solely on online sales. At its peak, Bebe operated a total of 312 stores, but by March 2017, this was down to 172.
* Bed Bath & Beyond announced in April 2019 that it would close 40 stores and also open 15 new stores that year. The company continued to struggle through the retail apocalypse, and in late summer of 2022, Bed Bath & Beyond announced plans to close 150 stores, lay off 20% of its corporate and supply chain staff, and eliminate the role of COO and CSO within the company. Liquidity was raised to about $1B after a loan and additional financing were secured. Bed Bath & Beyond's stock was also down on the market by 28%. Analysts warned that the company was teetering on the edge of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, citing that it could be too late to turn things around and that the company could default on its debt. Further exacerbating the financial woes, CFO Gustavo Arnal committed suicide only a few days after the store closures were announced. After months of continued losses and empty shelves, the chain warned that it was unable to pay off its debts and would potentially file for bankruptcy. In late January 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond announced the closure of an additional 87 stores, the liquidation of its Harmon Face Values chain, and the closure of 5 Buy Buy Baby stores. On February 8, 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond announced that it would close another 150 stores, selling its stock and raising $1B in an effort to stave off a bankruptcy filing. Days later, the chain's Canadian division was declared insolvent and began closing its 54 stores, also winding down its Canadian Buy Buy Baby operations. When a lifeline from Hudson Bay Capital Management failed to supplement the struggling home goods retailer, in addition to a $300 million stock offering never coming to fruition, Bed Bath & Beyond finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 23, 2023, and announced that all of its remaining stores, including the entire Buy Buy Baby brand, would be shuttered, with liquidation sales starting on April 26. The chain's assets were purchased by Overstock.com in a June 2023 auction; Overstock announced its intention to rebrand its online operations to the Bed Bath & Beyond name. A subsequent auction for sister chain Buy Buy Baby fell through, and its assets were sold to New Jersey-based Dream on Me on July 13, 2023. An attempt to relaunch eleven Buy Buy Baby stores failed by October 2024, as the brand moved to an online-only model.
* Best Buy issued forecasts of a 2.2% compound annual growth rate through 2021; analysts noted that competition from Amazon.com likely played into the low growth expectations. Its shares dropped 10% in value (roughly $1.7 billion in market value) on the news. On March 1, 2018, Best Buy announced that it would close all 250 Best Buy Mobile stores in the United States by the end of May 2018. However, none of the Mobile locations in Canada were impacted by the US closures.
* Big Lots announced in July 2024 that it would be closing 149 stores in 28 states, citing inflation and competition as the main causes of said closures. In August, additional store closures were announced, bringing the total of closing Big Lots locations to over 300. On September 9, 2024, Big Lots filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, planning to close additional stores upon being sold to its new owner, Nexus Capital Management LP. 50 of those additional stores were named in October, and another 56 were named within the month as well. While some closures ramped up, other locations cancelled liquidation sales and resumed regular operations. On December 19, 2024, Big Lots announced via a press release that its sale to Nexus fell through, and all 963 of its remaining stores would immediately begin going out of business. However, on December 28, 2024, Gordon Brothers, the company handling the liquidation sales, reached an agreement to sell up to 400 stores, two distribution centers, and intellectual property to Variety Wholesalers, which operates over 400 retail stores in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. under various banners; Variety Wholesalers plans to continue operating the acquired stores under the Big Lots brand and retain up to 10,000 employees.
* Blockbuster Inc. filed for bankruptcy in 2010; nearly all of its locations closed within years. As of March 1, 2019, only one video store worldwide, in Bend, Oregon, nicknamed *The Last Blockbuster*, remains out of over 9,000 the chain once had.

By the end of February, the Belgian and Danish branches of The Body Shop filed for administration, with all stores in both countries slated to close. In addition, 75 of its locations in the UK were also slated for closure.

Such a report is typically considered damaging to a company, as it affects their supply line.

The Canadian subsidiary, Sears Canada, successfully petitioned the courts on October 13, 2017, to allow it to close down the entire organization, including 130 stores, and liquidate all its assets by January 21, 2018, terminating around 12,000 positions. As such, all stores were closed on January 14, 2018. In January 2018, the company announced 103 more stores by the end of April, of which 39 were Sears and 64 Kmart.
