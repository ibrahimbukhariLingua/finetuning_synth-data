### Extendicare Parkside

By December 2020, 38 residents with COVID-19 had died in Parkside Extendicare in Regina, Saskatchewan. The outbreak was declared on November 20, 2020, and two weeks later, there were 50 residents that had tested positive for COVID-19. By March 21, it was confirmed by Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) that 41 people had died at Extendicare Parkside from the virus and over 200 residents and staff tested had positive for COVID-19 during the outbreak. In response to the second wave Extendicare Parkside outbreak, the Provincial Ombudsman began an investigation at the request of the Government of Saskatchewan. On December 9, SHA into a co-management agreement with Parkside Extendicare which lasted into 2021.

By March 2020, families of those who died in Extendicare facilities in Saskatchewan, represented by Regina-based lawyer Tony Merchant, prepared to file a class-action lawsuit for substandard care in Extendicare's long-term care facilities. According to Merchant, of the 117 people who died from COVID-19 in the province's care homes from the beginning of the outbreak to the middle of March 2020, 35% were in Extendicare facilities when they died.
On October 12th, 2022, the Saskatchewan Health Authority and the ECI group formally agreed that the SHA would assume responsibility for five Saskatchewan based Long Term Care Extendicare facilities. Details of the agreement include the transition of nearly 1,300 Extendicare staff to the SHA and the purchase of all five properties (one in Saskatoon, one in Moose Jaw and three in Regina).


### Financial support to LTC facilities

The Ontario Ministry of LTC provided COVID funding of CA$398.0 million, "which included $268.0 million in funding for COVID prevention and containment efforts". According to their 2020 annual report, they received CA$6.6 million in the spring of 2021 for the FY 2020.⁴⁵

According to a *Toronto Star* analysis of Extendicare's 2020 financial statements, in the first 3 quarters ending in September 2020, this for-profit company paid out nearly CA$29 million to shareholders in dividends at the same time that ParaMed received CA$82.2 million in federal wage subsidies through the program for front-line workers, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS). The *Star* investigation included the three major for-profit LTC providers, Sienna Senior Living, Chartwell Retirement Residences, as well as Extendicare. The companies said that the CEWS grants went directly to their frontline workers and were not to pay dividends.


### Class-action lawsuits and regulatory actions

There have been several COVID-related lawsuits filed against Extendicare facilities.

These lawsuits include an October 2020 CA$600,000 class action lawsuit with multiple defendants against multiple homes and levels of government, a second CA$210 class action lawsuit alleging "gross negligence" filed in October 2020, regarding one of Extendicare's LTC facilities—later amended to include claims against 35 Extendicare's operations.

In November 2020, the Ontario government, under Premier Doug Ford passed Bill 218, Supporting Ontario's Recovery Act—retroactive to March 17, 2020—which provides some liability protections to individuals, corporations, or other entities, including LTC corporations, against COVID-19-related legal claims that limit claimants ability to win a lawsuit "except in certain circumstances".
