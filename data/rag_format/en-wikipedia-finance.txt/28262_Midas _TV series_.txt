## Cast


### Main characters

* Jang Hyuk as Kim Do-hyun (32 years old)

Do-hyun is a smart man with great ambition. Kim graduated at the top of his class from Korea's best university. He was also top of the class in law school. His father had left home when he was a child, leaving him and his mother in poverty. His mother raised him in hardship and died while he was studying in law school. He feels warmth in his heart only when he is with his long-time girlfriend Jung-yeon and her family. He wants to start a family and live happily with Jung-yeon. After graduating from law school, he joins the best law firm in Korea and works for the rich Yoo family. His ambitions soon turn into greed, which, in turn, begins to ruin his life.

* Lee Min-jung as Lee Jung-yeon (27 years old)

Lee is a longtime girlfriend of Do-hyun. After graduating from nursing school, she was employed by one of Korea's topmost general hospitals and she became a nurse in the said hospital's VIP wing soon after. When Do-hyun starts to become a different person after joining his law firm, Lee is forced to leave Do-hyun because of his greed. She joins Yoo Myung-joon in plotting revenge against Yoo In-hye, who they deemed responsible for Do-hyun's change of character.

* Kim Hee-ae as Yoo In-hye (40 years old)

Yoo In-hye is the eldest daughter in Yoo Pil-sang's family. The Yoo's seem like the average rich family, but their wealth is at the same level as Samsung and Hyundai. Yoo In-hye has two elder half-brothers, a younger brother and a younger sister. Not all of the five siblings have the same birth mother. In-hye's father left her mother after she had an affair. In order to escape the negative image of "the abandoned daughter of a chaebol", In-hye left Korea for the United States. She received her MBA at university, then gained experience as a securities broker in Wall Street. Now she is the president of her own multibillion-dollar hedge fund. Her grandfather's loan business, her father's real estate business, and her hedge fund company have the power to sway Korea's economy. She is a powerful woman with no romantic experience and has never been married. She hates, but also admires, her father, which gives her conflict. She is the one who will change Do-hyun's life, for better or for worse.

* No Min-woo as Yoo Myung-joon (31 years old)

Yoo Myung-joon is the younger brother of Yoo In-hye. Unlike his sister, he has a softer and more-delicate character. He is a patient in the hospital VIP room where Jung-yeon was assigned, and is in the terminal stages of cancer. Myung-joon believes that money is the reason for the misfortunes that he has suffered. Therefore, he views money as evil. Myung-joon has a cynical nature and wastes his time by partying from dusk till dawn. He was like this until Jung-yeon appeared in his life. As time goes by, a chemistry springs up between the two.
