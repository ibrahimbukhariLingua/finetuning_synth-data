### Ecological economics: Sustainability in Practice

Stanislav Edward Shmelev authored the widely used textbook 'Ecological economics: sustainability in practice (ISBN 978-94-007-1971-2). The book officially launched in 2012.


### Macro sustainability Assessment

Stanislav Edward Shmelev developed a novel method of sustainability assessment that uses the potential of multi-criteria decision aid tools (MCDA) and applies them to the dynamic sets of sustainability criteria. This research developed from a series of lectures he gave at European universities on sustainability in Russia, where social and environmental aspects of economic development have been neglected. This methodology is particularly important for defining sustainability, assessing the progress towards sustainability of a given society or system. Several applied cases have been published now:

### Multidimensional assessment of biodiversity

In 2008-2009, Stanislav Shmelev produced a major report for IUCN where he presented a rationale for the Multidimensional Assessment of Ecosystems and Biodiversity. The report has been published in Shmelev (2012).

In 2009, the United Nations Environment Programme invited Shmelev to be a reviewer for The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) Reportᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ

In 2018, Stanislav Shmelev published a photography album entitled 'Ecosystems', which hoped to show the futility of measuring ecological worth with monetary value.

In 2021, Stanislav Shmelev was selected as one of the world's 120 top contemporary artists and exhibited at the Arte Laguna Prize exhibition in Venice.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Sustainable energy

The innovative paper published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews adopts a multi-criteria perspective and extends the UK decarbonisation scenarios by dimensions that are often overlooked, namely, employment, land use, water use and diversity of the energy mix \*Shmelev, Stanislav E.; Van Den Bergh, Jeroen C.J.M.

In 2009, Shmelev was interviewed for the European Union Euronews Channel on the issues of renewable energy and sustainable development

### Sustainable cities

The issue of sustainable cities has been dealt with by Shmelev in the context of the interdisciplinary linkages in the development of large cities. He co-organized two international workshops on sustainable cities at the University of Oxford and Saint Petersburg State University.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The first workshop resulted in a book:

* Shmeleva I. A. and Shmelev S. E. (Eds) (2007) Sustainable Urban Development: Interdisciplinary Approach, St Petersburg State University, 265 pp.

The second workshop produced a special issue of the International Journal of Sustainable Development entirely devoted to sustainable cities:

The issues of multidimensional benchmarking for megacities have been analysed in detail in the recent book, *Green Economy Reader: Lectures in Ecological Economics and Sustainability* ISBN 978-3-319-38919-6ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

New peer-reviewed publications exploring the subject of smart and sustainable cities include:
