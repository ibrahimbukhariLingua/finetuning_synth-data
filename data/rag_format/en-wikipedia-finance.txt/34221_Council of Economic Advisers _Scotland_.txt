Council of Economic Advisers (Scotland)


# Council of Economic Advisers (Scotland)



The **Council of Economic Advisers** (**CEA**) in Scotland was a group of economists and leading figures from the private sector and academia who advised the Scottish Government. Its principal aims were to advise on improving the competitiveness of the Scottish economy and how to tackle inequality within Scotland. It was established in 2007, meeting for the first time on 21 September. The Council had two formal meetings a year and also carried out engagement and work between meetings. Minutes of its meetings and other reports are available on its website.

The council was replaced in 2021 with the Advisory Council for Economic Transformation, which is no longer active.
