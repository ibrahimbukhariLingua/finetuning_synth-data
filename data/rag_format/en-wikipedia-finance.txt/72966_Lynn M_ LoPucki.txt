# Lynn M. LoPucki



**Lynn M. LoPucki** holds professorial positions at both UCLA School of Law as well as Harvard Law School. LoPucki is the Security Pacific Bank Professor of Law at UCLA Law and the Bruce W. Nichols Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law. LoPucki is a nationally recognized expert on bankruptcy and compiled a widely used research database on bankruptcy in the U.S. called Bankruptcy Research Database which forms the basis for a large portion of empirical academic research on bankruptcy.

LoPucki is notable for his criticism of the bankruptcy industry in the U.S. including the magnitude of fees paid to professionals as well as corruption within the court system. In his book *Courting Failure: How Competition for Big Cases Is Corrupting the Bankruptcy Courts* (University of Michigan Press, 2005), LoPucki asserted that Federal Bankruptcy judges have become corrupted by their competition to attract large company bankruptcy filings to their districts, and are offering favorable rulings for such companies in order to attract them.

He graduated from University of Michigan and Harvard Law School.
