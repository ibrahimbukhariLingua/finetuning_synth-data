Afghan rupee


# Afghan rupee



The **Afghan rupee** was the currency of Afghanistan between the mid-18th century and early 20th century. It was subdivided into 60 *paisa*, each of 10 *dinar*. Other denominations issued included the *shahi* of 5 paisa, the *sanar* of 10 paisa, the *abbasi* of 20 paisa, the *qiran* of 1⁄2 rupee and the *tilla* and later the *amani*, both of Rs. 10/-.

Before 1891, silver rupees circulated with copper *falus* and gold *mohur*. The three metals had no fixed exchange rate between them, with different regions issuing their own coins. That year, a new currency was introduced, based on the *Kabuli rupee* and replacing both that and its *Kandahari* variant. The Afghan rupee was replaced in 1923 by the Afghani.

The Afghan rupee was put into circulation by Afghan Emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1754. The rupee itself was first issued by Sher Shah Suri during his rule of Sur Empire in the sixteenth century; India and Pakistan still use their variant of the rupee since their independence from 1947.
