## Acquisitions

In August 2001, Conseco acquired EXL and operated it as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2002, Oak Hill Capital Partners and FTVentures acquired the company from Conseco. The company's stock started trading on the NASDAQ exchange on October 20, 2006, under the symbol EXLS.

Shortly before EXL's debut on NASDAQ, it started down the path of growth through acquisitions with the purchase of the peer company Inductis. This acquisition was aimed at diversifying the revenue stream for EXL; prior to acquisition, 90% of EXL's revenues were from business process outsourcing (BPO), while after, BPO accounted for 70% with the balance in research and analytics and advisory services.

In 2011, EXL expanded their delivery footprint in Eastern Europe and South East Asia through acquisition of OPI.

In 2013, in reaction to the establishment of the Affordable Care Act and its mandate that all Americans acquire health insurance, EXL was reported to have planned a major run of acquisitions in the United States healthcare industry. At the time of this report in 2013, EXL drew roughly 10% of its revenues from the healthcare industry.

In 2014, EXL expanded into Latin America through a strategic joint venture with CT&S through which EXL's technology experience would be combined with CT&S's local knowledge and brand image. This joint venture also supported the growing customer base of EXL for Spanish-language services.

In 2018, EXL acquired SCIOInspire Holdings, expanding its healthcare analytics capabilities.

In 2021, EXL acquired Clairvoyant, adding scale in data, AI, and cloud engineering.
