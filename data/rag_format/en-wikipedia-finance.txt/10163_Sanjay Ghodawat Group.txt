## Controversies

In 2004, when the Government of Maharashtra imposed a ban on gutka, pan masala and flavoured tobacco, responding to this, Ghodawat Pan Masala Products filed a legal case against the ban. The Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of Ghodawat Pan Masala Products, asserting that 'since paan masala, gutkha, and supari are consumed for taste and nourishment, they all fall under the category of food.' Before this, Gutka manufacturers consistently challenged bans by arguing that gutkha was not a food item. The Supreme Court also overturned the ban and ruled that only the Central government had the authority to prohibit the sale of a food item. The case is known as *Ghodawat Pan Masala Products and Ors. v. Union of India*.
