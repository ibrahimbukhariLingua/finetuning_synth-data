# Raindance Communications



**Raindance Communications, Inc.** was an American company that provided online meeting, web conferencing and teleconferencing services. The company offered interactive services including automated phone conferencing, web conferencing, and collaboration, which allows users the ability to whiteboard, tour the web, and share desktop applications.


## History

Raindance was founded in April 1997 in Delaware. Their principal executive offices were located in Louisville, Colorado. The company had its first recorded revenues in January 1998 and had incurred net losses since inception. Raindance began offering its web and phone conferencing service in April 1999 and the Web Conferencing Pro service upon our acquisition of Contigo Software, Inc. in June 2000.

In May 2001, the company changed its name from Evoke to Raindance Communications as a result of a settlement agreement reached in January between Evoke Software, "Raindance is an inviting symbol of how we harness the collective energy of a group of people. We allow workgroups to spontaneously come together over the phone and web to share ideas and make things happen." That same year, Raindance was restructured to solely focus on web and phone conferencing services. In connection with this restructuring, significant changes were made to the services and growth strategies, including a significant reduction in the employee base. As a result of the limited operating history, increased competition and the rapidly changing market for the web conferencing services the company's quarterly operating results have varied significantly from period to period. For example, its quarterly net loss ranged between $1.8 million and $12.9 million in the four quarters ended March 31, 2002. The company's quarterly revenue ranged between $9.1 million and $13.9 million in the four quarters ended March 31, 2002.

In February 2006, Raindance was acquired by Omaha, Nebraska-based West Corporation, a provider of outsourced communication solutions for $110 million, at $2.70 per share in cash. Shareholders of Raindance agreed to the acquisition in April 2006 and the company was then incorporated into InterCall, Inc., a division of West Corporation.
