Sky Lease Cargo


# Sky Lease Cargo



**Sky Lease Cargo Inc.** (legally *Sky Lease I Inc*) is an American cargo airline based in Miami, Florida.


## History

The airline was established in 1969, as **Wrangler Aviation** and started operations in 1973, using Lockheed Constellation aircraft under FAA Part 91. It became a Part 121 carrier in 1978 and became an all-cargo airline in 1981.

Between 1991 and 1992, issues of citizenship, ownership, and compliance with federal airline laws resulted in the conclusion and finding that through the unregulated use of "Delaware Company Law" and the practice of subsidiaries being parts of other subsidiaries," Wrangler Aviation did not meet the fitness requirements of a certificated airline of the United States. The conclusions resulted in restructuring changes to the company to continue operating.


### Tradewinds Airlines

In 1991, the airline was renamed to **Tradewinds Airlines**. On February 28, 1994, Tradewinds was acquired by Florida West Airlines, although it was sold off a year later. In December 2007, Donald Watkins, a lawyer from Alabama bought part of the company. On June 6, 2008, the airline reduced its staff by 70% and parked all their fleet.

During 2006, explorative attempts were made by Valiant Airways to contract Tradewinds Airlines for "start-up" operations, but these attempts failed to result in services coming to fruition.

Further press releases on June 3, 2008, indicate that Tradewinds returned five Boeing 747-200F aircraft to the lessor and furloughed employees that operated the lines. On July 25, 2008, Tradewinds Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the third time. The company cited rising fuel costs and low demand, but plans to continue to operate flights during reorganization. In December 2008, Tradewinds Airlines was purchased by Sky Lease One, based out of Florida.


### Sky Lease Cargo

Tradewinds Airlines was renamed *Sky Lease Cargo* on September 4, 2011, and also changed its IATA and ICAO codes. The company operates two 747-400s to various points in South America from Miami International Airport.
