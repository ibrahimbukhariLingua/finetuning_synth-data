Pooley-Tupy theorem


# Pooley-Tupy theorem



The **Pooley-Tupy theorem** is an economics theorem which measures the growth in knowledge resources over time at individual and population levels.

{\displaystyle Percentage\ Change\ in\ Knowledge\ Resources=\left({\frac {Time\ Price\_{t}}{Population\_{t}}}\right)\div \left({\frac {Time\ Price\_{t+n}}{Population\_{t+n}}}\right)-1}

The theorem was formulated by Gale Pooley and Marian Tupy who developed the approach in 2018 in their paper: *The Simon Abundance Index: A New Way to Measure Availability of Resources*.

The theorem is informed by the work of Julian Simon, George Gilder, Thomas Sowell, F. A. Hayek, Paul Romer, and others.

Gilder offers three axioms; wealth is knowledge, growth is learning, and money is time. From these propositions a theorem can be derived: **The growth in knowledge can be measured with time.**

While money prices are expressed in dollar and cents, time prices are expressed in hours and minutes. A time price is equal to the money price divided by an hourly income rate.

{\displaystyle Time\ Price={\frac {Money\ Price}{Hourly\ Income}}}

The Pooley-Tupy theorem adds changes in population as an additional variable in their formulation. In the case of an individual, population is equal to 1 at {\displaystyle t} and {\displaystyle t+n}.


## Examples

If knowledge resources were being evaluated at the individual level and the time price was 60 minutes at {\displaystyle t} and 45 minutes at {\displaystyle t+n}, the percentage change in knowledge resources would be:

{\displaystyle =(60\div 45)-1}

{\displaystyle =1.33-1}

{\displaystyle =0.33=33\%}

If population at {\displaystyle t} was 100 and 200 at {\displaystyle t+n}, the percentage change in knowledge resources would be:

{\displaystyle =(60\div 100)\div (45\div 200)-1}

{\displaystyle =(.6)\div (.225)-1}

{\displaystyle =2.666-1}

{\displaystyle =1.666=166.6\%}


## Other equations

The Pooley-Tupy Theorem is part of an analytical framework that uses several other equations for analysis. This framework is described in their book, Superabundance: The story of population growth, innovation, and human flourishing on an infinitely bountiful planet.

The percentage change in a time price over time can be expresses as:

{\displaystyle Percentage\ Change\ in\ Time\ Price={\frac {Time\ Price\_{t+n}}{Time\ Price\_{t}}}-1}

The resource multiplier indicates how much more or less of a resource the same amount of time can buy at two points in time.

{\displaystyle Resource\ Multiplier={\frac {Time\ Price\_{t}}{Time\ Price\_{t+n}}}}

The percentage change in the resource multiplier is just the resource multiplier minus one.

{\displaystyle Percentage\ Change\ in\ Resource\ Multiplier=Resource\ Multiplier-1}

The compound annual growth rate or CAGR can be calculated as:

{\displaystyle Compound\ Annual\ Growth\ Rate=Resource\ Multiplier^{1/n}-1}
