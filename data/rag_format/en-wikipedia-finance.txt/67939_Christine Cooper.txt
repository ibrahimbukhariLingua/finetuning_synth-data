## Research

Cooper's research draws on Marx, Foucault, and other social theorists to examine the economic, political and social impact of accounting, particularly on our daily lives. Her published research has covered:

* Social and environmental accounting
* Accounting and gender
* Privatization
* Deskilling of accountants and bookkeepers
* Insolvency, taxation, and accountability
* Financial innovation in the charitable sector
* Neoliberal governance.

Cooper's most cited paper, "The Non and Nom of Accounting for (M)other Nature," offers a feminist critique of accounting, particularly its capacity to function as a tool for reporting on environmental performance. The article follows Hélène Cixous in adopting the word "feminine" rather than "feminist," in order to challenge what Cooper sees as the masculine symbolic structures of accounting. The article has been cited over 300 times, according to Google Scholar.
