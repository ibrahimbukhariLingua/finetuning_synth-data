**Mercator Serbia** (Serbian: Меркатор Србија, romanized: *Merkator Srbija*) also known as **Mercator-S**, is a Serbian supermarket chain and a part of Mercator Group, an international retail chain based in Slovenia. As of 2016, it holds a 15.98% market share in Serbia.


## History

The company was established in 2002 when the first Mercator Center Belgrade was opened in New Belgrade. The 50,000 square meter Center underwent a complete renovation and was re-opened in 2012.

In October 2006, Mercator acquired 76% of Rodić M&B company for 116 million euros, becoming the major shareholder in Roda Supermarkets. The full ownership takeover of this company was completed in 2009.

In June 2013, the Croatian Agrokor Group initiated the takeover of Mercator Group, which was completed in June 2014. They then began integrating their operations in Serbia under the Mercator brand, which included Mercator Centers, Roda Megamarkets, and Idea supermarkets. The takeover was approved by the Serbian Commission for the Protection of Competition in December 2013.

In December 2017, the Serbian holding company MPC Holding purchased Mercator Center Belgrade from Mercator Serbia for a sum of 46 million euros. As of December 31, 2018, Mercator operates 321 retail stores in Serbia, including 241 Idea markets, 35 Idea supermarkets, 30 Roda markets, 6 Roda megamarkets, and two Mercator hypermarkets.

In August 2019, the Mercator Group initiated the process of selling an additional 12 supermarkets across the former Yugoslavia region in order to reduce debts. Among the listed markets for sale, two of them are owned by Mercator Serbia.
