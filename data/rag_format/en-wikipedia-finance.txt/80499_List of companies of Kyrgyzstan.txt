List of companies of Kyrgyzstan


# List of companies of Kyrgyzstan



The economy of Kyrgyzstan is highly dependent on agriculture and mining, as both sectors make up more than one-third of Kyrgyzstan's economy. While it was part of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan was one of the major producers of uranium during the 1950s. However, uranium mining activity would cease to exist by the 1990s. In 2022, Kyrgyzstan gained full control of the Kumtor Gold Mine, one of the largest gold deposits in the world, after settling a dispute with Centerra Gold. In 2021, the three major export partners of Kyrgyzstan were the United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, and Russia and in 2019, the three major import partners of Kyrgyzstan were China, Russia, and Kazakhstan.
