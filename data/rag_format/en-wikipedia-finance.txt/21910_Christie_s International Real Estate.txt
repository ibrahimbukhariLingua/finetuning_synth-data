Christie's International Real Estate


# Christie's International Real Estate



**Christie's International Real Estate** is an international network of independently owned luxury real estate firms with more than 400 offices and approximately 10,000 real estate agents in nearly 50 countries and territories around the world. The brand is separately owned but strategically partnered with Christie’s, the fine art auction house.


## History

Christie’s International Real Estate was originally founded in 1987 as Great Estates. In 1995, the Great Estates brand was acquired by Christie’s, the London-based auction house, and in 2011, Christie’s changed the name from Christie’s Great Estates to Christie’s International Real Estate. In December 2021, a venture led by Mike Golden and Thad Wong, co-founders of Chicago-based real estate brokerage and technology firm @properties, acquired Christie’s International Real Estate from Christie’s, entering into a long-term global brand licensing agreement.
