# Yehiel Nissim da Pisa



**Yehiel Nissim da Pisa** (**Vitale**) (1507–1574) was an Italian-Jewish banker, writer, and philosopher, who wrote a treatise on the use of credit, *Ma'amar ḥayei olam at inyan haribit*, as well as several texts on philosophy, usury and loans.

## Biography

His family operated a pawnshop and loan-banking business in Florence. His grandfather was Jehiel of Pisa. He became a friend and associate of Lorenzo de Medici.

After the licenses for Jews to operate the family's businesses were revoked by the Florentine government, he became a scholar and a kabbalistic authority.

In his philosophic works, he was critical of Aristotelianism, Gersonides and Maimonides, preferring anti-rationalism, arguing that the kabbalah, Torah and Jewish tradition were self-sufficient sources of knowledge, and emphasized the uniqueness and spirituality of the Jewish people. He cited the Zohar, Judah Halevi and Nahmanides, Averroes, particularly his commentary on Aristotle's *Physics*, and Agostino Nifo. His work addresses the Jewish view of usury.
