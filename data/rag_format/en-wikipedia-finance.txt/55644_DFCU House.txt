## History

DFCU Group, the parent company of DFCU Bank, had its headquarters offices scattered in several buildings in Kampala. In September 2011, construction began on a ten-story office complex on Nakasero Hill, to serve as the group's headquarters and house the main branch of the bank. Roko Construction Limited, a Ugandan construction company, was contracted to construct the building at an estimated cost of US$10 million (UGX:28 billion). Construction began in September 2011, with completion during the second half of 2013. As of June 2014, the construction was complete and occupancy was expected to take place in the second half of 2014. The office tower, valued at UGX:55 billion at that time, was officially dedicated as open in September 2015.
