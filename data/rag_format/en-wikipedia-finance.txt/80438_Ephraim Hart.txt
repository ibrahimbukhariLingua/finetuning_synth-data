On April 2, 1787, he was registered as an elector of the Shearith Israel congregation.

By 1792, he had become one of the most successful merchants in the City, and at this time he helped to organize the Board of Stock-Brokers, now known as the New York Stock Exchange, being one of the signatories of the Buttonwood Agreement of 1792 that founded the Exchange.
