## History

IMB Bank was established in 1880 in the port community of Wollongong, 85km south of Sydney. It began life as the **Illawarra Mutual Building Society**, with the express purpose of “enabling people to become their own landlords”.

It grew throughout southern New South Wales over subsequent decades, entering the Sydney market in 1989, Melbourne in 2006 and, after a successful merger with the **Hunter United Credit Union**, the Newcastle/Hunter Region in 2020.

IMB became a mutual bank in 2015, formally rebranding as **IMB Bank**.
