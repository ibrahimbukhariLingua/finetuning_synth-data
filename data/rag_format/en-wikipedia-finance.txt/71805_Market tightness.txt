Market tightness


# Market tightness



**Market tightness** is a measure of the liquidity of a market. High market tightness indicates relatively low liquidity and high transaction costs, whereas low market tightness indicates high liquidity and low transaction costs. For example, during the dotcom bubble, information technology companies were very difficult and expensive to buy a part of, through stock, loan, or other methods, due to the tightness of competition in the market.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
