# CCP Global



The **Global Association of Central Counterparties** or **CCP Global**, formerly **CCP12**, is the trade association of central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs) located in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and China. It represents 39 primary members, and 3 observer members of CCPs
operating across Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe and representing over 60 individual CCPs. CCP12 was formed in 2001 by major central counterparty organizations in Europe, Asia and the Americas to share CCP related information and to develop analyses and policy standards for common areas of concern.


## History

CCP12 was formed in 2001 by major central counterparty organizations in Europe, Asia and the Americas to share CCP related information and to develop analyses and policy standards for common areas of concern. In 2008 at its annual meeting in Tokyo, CCP12 endorsed the collaboration by forming an executive committee to govern its global agenda. In 2015, the CCP12 was registered as an official association in Shanghai, China and a CCP12 office was opened there in 2017. In 2022 opened a second CCP12 Office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In 2023, CCP12 was renamed CCP Global, though the formal name remains the Global Association of Central Counterparties.
