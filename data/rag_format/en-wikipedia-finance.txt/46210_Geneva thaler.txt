Geneva thaler


# Geneva thaler



The **Geneva thaler** was a coin equivalent to the French silver écu, containing 26.67 g fine silver and valued at 123⁄4 *florins*, which was issued by Geneva until 1798 (except briefly between 1794 and 1795) and between 1813 and 1839.


## History

The currencies used in Geneva were the *florin, petite monnaie* (each of 12 *sols* or 144 *deniers, petite monnaie*) and the *livre courant* worth 31⁄2 florins (each of 20 *sols* or 240 *deniers, courant*). The florin & livre were the currencies of the Republic of Geneva except in 1794–95, when the genevoise was used, and in 1798–1813, when Geneva was annexed by France and the French franc was used. The florin & livre were replaced in 1839 by the Geneva franc, and after 1848 by the Swiss franc.


## Coins

In the late 18th century, billon coins were issued in denominations of 6 and 9 deniers, 1, 1+1⁄2, 3 and 6 sols, together with silver 15 sols, 1⁄2 and 1 thaler and gold 1 and 3 *pistole*. The 1⁄2 thaler were coined as "VI FLORINS IVS VID", whilst the 1 thaler were coined "XII FLORINS IX SOLS".
