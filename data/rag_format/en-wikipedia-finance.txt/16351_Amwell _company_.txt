## Services and business model

The company offers 24-hour teleconference access to licensed and credentialed physicians. It sells its platform as a subscription service to healthcare providers to put their medical professionals online and helps clients white-label and embed telehealth within their existing healthcare offerings for their patients and members.

Amwell enables care delivery across the healthcare continuum – from primary care and urgent care to high acuity specialty consults and telepsychiatry.

The platform can be fully embedded into clients’ portals and provider workflows. Providers can launch telehealth directly from their native Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with seamless integration to their payer eligibility and claims systems.

Providers, patients and members can access this care through a variety of platforms, including mobile, web, phone and proprietary kiosks and carts that support multi-way video, phone or secure messaging interactions.

The Amwell Medical Group is a nationwide physician owned and operated medical practice that provides telehealth care exclusively on Amwell platforms.

The Amwell app is the direct-to-consumer telehealth platform of Amwell. The app connects people with doctors over secure video, without the need for an appointment. In 2014, Amwell passed the 1 million downloads mark and was called the most popular telehealth app of the year by App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. In March 2015, Amwell earned the American Telemedicine Association's first Accreditation for online patient consults.

Amwell has an international presence through a partnership with Meuhedet, the third-largest health maintenance organization in Israel, which leverages the Amwell Platform.
