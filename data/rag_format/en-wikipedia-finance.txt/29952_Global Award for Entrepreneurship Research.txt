## The Prize

The recipient of the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research is awarded a prize sum of 100,000 Euros. Recipients also receive a reproduction of Swedish Sculptor Carl Milles' The Hand of God.


## The History of the Award

During the Internal Conference for Small Business's World Conference in 1996, a proposal was made to create an award to recognize excellence in research in the field of entrepreneurship and small business. The award aimed to emphasize the importance of entrepreneurship research, stimulate and promote further research in the field, and disseminate state-of-the-art research among scholars, practitioners, and small business developers. The International Award for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research was established in that same year in 1996. In 2008 the award was renamed the Global Award for Entrepreneurship Research, and the monetary prize was increased in value to €100,000.
