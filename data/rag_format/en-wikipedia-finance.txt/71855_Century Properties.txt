More recently, through a business expansion program into allied sectors of real estate, CPG has diversified from being primarily engaged in in-city vertical residential developments (under its subsidiaries Century City Development Corporation and Century Limitless Corporation) to horizontal affordable housing (through PHirst Park Homes, Inc.) in key growth cities outside Metro Manila and the commercial leasing of retail and office spaces.

The company, through subsidiary Century Properties Management, Inc., (“CPMI”) also engages in a wide range of property management services, from facilities management and auction services, to lease and secondary sales. Through CPMI, the company endeavors to ensure the properties it manages maintain and improve their asset value, and are safe and secure. CPMI manages 52 projects covering 66 buildings of December 31, 2020 with 3.58 million sq.m of GFA under management.
Of the total, 73% of the projects CPMI manages were developed by third-parties.

## History

The company was incorporated on September 6, 1983. In 1986 with six employees, it launched its operations, focusing primarily on providing third-party marketing and sales for real estate developers.


## Vertical and high-rise developments

Leveraging on the experience it gathered in real estate sales and marketing, the founders saw a solid opportunity in establishing a separate property development arm, Meridien, which focused on mid-market, central business district high-rise developments. Meridien began the development and construction of its first project, Le Grand in Makati to cater to the middle market segment.

Meridien developed at a rate of one to two buildings per year, all located in the central business districts of Makati and Ortigas. During this time, Century became known to the public as a developer of high rise condominia in the central business districts of the Philippines.


## Century Properties Management, Inc. (CPMI)

On March 17, 1989, the founder established CPM to handle the Group's property management services for both Century and non-Century developments. Since its founding, CPMI has handled 43 buildings, including landmarks such as the Asian Development Bank, Philippine National Bank Headquarters, BPI Buendia Center and Pacific Star Building.

Separately, the companies continued their operations throughout the 1990s. CPG focused on generating sales for the Century-developed properties, while keeping its third-party marketing services to other real estate companies.


## Essensa East Forbes

In 1997, through Meridien, CPG was given the opportunity to purchase a property in Fort Bonifacio. At this time, the company decided to develop the Essensa condominium. It was designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb and Freed, led by Pritzker Prize winning architect I.M. Pei. Utilizing some of the finest materials in its design such as Travertine stone quarried from the same source as the Colosseum in Rome, units in the Essensa have an average unit size of 290 square meters and have prices ranging from PhP35 million to PhP60 million.


## Horizontal/housing development

The company further expanded its property development business when it embarked on its first large-scale horizontal development: Canyon Ranch. Located in Carmona, Cavite, this 16-hectare gated community is situated in the hilly portion of the San Lazaro Leisure Park owned by the Manila Jockey Club, Inc.

In order to specifically manage the development of this project, the proprietors of Century decided to incorporate CCC on March 15, 1994. Canyon Ranch, launched in 2004, officially marked CCC's entry into mid-market horizontal developments, catering to modern families who prefer the quiet suburban life.


## Joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation

In 2018, Century Properties signed a joint venture partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation to establish PHirst Park Homes. Capitalizing on the country's demand for affordable housing, which has then an estimated backlog of roughly 6.6 million units, the new joint venture company was established to pursue the development of projects of scale in key locations outside of Metro Manila.


## Century City

In 2006, the company bought a portion of the lot formerly occupied by International School Manila. Using its experience in developing buildings and infrastructure, the Company incorporated CCDC on December 19, 2006 to expand Century's business into large-scale mixed-use developments. Presently, the said area located in Kalayaan Avenue, Makati is the venue for CCDC's current residential projects: Milano Residences, The Gramercy Residences, and The Knightsbridge Residences. It will also house a hospital, a retail center, and an IT park.


## Century Limitless Corporation

Responding to the high demand for affordable housing, Century further expanded its product line with the creation of a separate company especially focused on this segment. On July 9, 2008, CLC was incorporated with the sole purpose of developing vertical projects for the affordable to middle-income housing segment. In 2009, CLC launched its first project, Azure Urban Resort Residences, providing condo living for young couples and families, Filipino expatriates, and end-users wanting to live in Parañaque City. Azure Beach Club Paris Hilton is also managed by CLC.
