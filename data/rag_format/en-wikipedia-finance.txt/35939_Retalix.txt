## Company history

Since its inception until the mid-1990s, the company focused on the development and sale of store-level software solutions to grocery retailers. During the late 1990s, the company widened its offerings to cover also solutions for the fuel and convenience retail market, as well as solutions covering the management of retail operations at the chain level. In 2000, the company changed its name from "Point Of Sale Ltd" to "Retalix Ltd", to reflect the expansion of its solutions offering beyond the store level.

On March 27, 2006, Retalix Ltd. restated its second- and third-quarter results on accounting issues, reducing revenue and earnings in both periods.

Retalix's growth strategy has been to expand its enterprise and supply chain management applications while maintaining close integration with its widely installed, in-store solutions. It has grown both organically and through acquisition. In 2004 Retalix acquired OMI International, a warehouse management system (WMS) and supply chain management (SCM) vendor that was also focused on the retail food sector. The company continued with its growth strategy in 2005 through the acquisition of IDS, which expanded its offerings to include enterprise software for wholesale distributors. Also in 2005, Retalix acquired TCI Solutions, a software provider for grocery retailers in the area of store and headquarters management and operations. In recent years, Retalix introduced new solutions complementing current retail industry focuses, such as customer loyalty and optimization of ordering.

Between 1994 and 2013, Retalix was a public company. The company's ordinary shares traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol RTLX. The company's shares also traded in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). Retalix was listed on the Tel-Tech 15 Index, the TASE's leading technology index, as well as on the TA-100 Index, consisting of the TASE's top 100 stocks by market capitalization. In November 2012, it was announced that NCR Corporation had agreed to acquire Retalix for $650 million, or $30 per share. The acquisition was completed in February 2013, subsequent to which Retalix was delisted from both the Nasdaq and the TASE.
