## Controversy


### LIBOR Rigging

At the United Kingdom's Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (PCBS), which is headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury of the Anglican Communion, Justin Welby, as well as Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, four UBS witnesses, including Huw Jenkins as the CEO of UBS Investment Bank, were invited by the PCBS to give testimony about the failure to detect rigging of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which resulted in the bank being fined $1.5 billion.

The PCBS found that "Libor [was] being manipulated for years." Closing the proceedings, Andrew Tyrie told the UBS executives that "You were ignorant and out of your depth." Huw Jenkins stated in his testimony that "It [Libor fixing] was a very engrained part of the business areas, so it would not surprise me if it was going on before that [for many years]. I'm clearly deeply sorry we didn't spot this. It is clearly a failing in our systems and controls and our culture that it wasn't highlighted." After the PCBS hearings had ended, Jenkins submitted a letter to the PCBS, making it clear that the closing comments made by the Chairman had not been levelled against him individually. He rejected the charge of incompetence and pointed out that several investigations, including those led by the U.S. Department of Justice and U.K. Financial Standards Authority, had concluded he had no knowledge of the practice of rate rigging.ᵗʰⁱʳᵈ-ᵖᵃʳᵗʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by former BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee

An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Jenkins and Banco BTG Pactual SA CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA. Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which he was promised a partnership and shares. Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013. Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.

As of February 15, 2017 the case was still ongoing. BTG Pactual has said that he is a disgruntled former employee and that his claim is completely without merit.


### Pactual sale to UBS Investment Bank and resale to BTG

Arthur Rutishauser in *Sonntagszeitung* argued that the way André Esteves acquired 27% of his bank is an example of an insider case: Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction. Suffering financial constraints linked to the credit crisis, UBS put Pactual up for sale in 2009 as part of an effort to reduce its risk profile and improve its balance sheet. Esteves repurchased Pactual in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG. Huw Jenkins left UBS in 2008, and subsequently joined BTG Pactual in 2009 as a consultant, becoming a partner and board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.


### BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI

On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd. Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual. Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves allegedly committed insider trades. Esteves settled the claim brought by the Italian financial regulator in April 2012. BTG Pactual announced February 22, 2016 that it had entered into a definitive agreement under which EFG International would acquire BSI. FINMA subjected the transaction to a rigorous review, and it was approved on May 26, 2016. BTG Pactual maintains a minority stake in EFG International.
