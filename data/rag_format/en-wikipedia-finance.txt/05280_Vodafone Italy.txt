## History

In December 1995, Omnitel Sistemi Radiocellulari Italiani (founded on June 19, 1990, by Olivetti, Lehman Brothers, Bell Atlantic and Telia) and Pronto Italia (made up of Zignago Vetro, AirTouch, Mannesmann, Banca di Roma, Arca Merchant, Comeba, Ersel, Erg, Urmet TLC, Spal TLC, Site, Ponti Radio and Fergia) merged into Omnitel Pronto Italia, which launched a mobile telephony service, the second in Italy after TIM (formerly SIP). Olivetti, the original majority shareholder, through Omnitel and Infostrada (which dealt instead with fixed telephony), thus competed with Telecom Italia, which until then monopolized the entire telecommunications sector in Italy.

In 1999, Olivetti sold its interest in Omnitel and Infostrada to the German consortium Mannesmann, after Olivetti took control of Telecom Italia. By this time, Mannesmann had a majority stake in Omnitel with a 53.7% equity stake. The following year, Vodafone merged with Mannesmann thereby taking control of Omnitel. The merger led in 2001 to the change of company name to Omnitel Vodafone, and in 2002 to Vodafone Omnitel, and in the same year the registered office was transferred from Ivrea (TO) to Amsterdam, thus passing from being a *società per azioni* (S.p.A.) legally registered in Italy to a *naamloze vennootschap* (N.V.) legally registered in the Netherlands

In 2004, the company launched UMTS services in 140 cities. Two years later, it lso launched HSPA services.

In 2007, Vodafone bought the Italian and Spanish branches of Tele2.

Following the acquisition of Tele2 Italia (in 2010 renamed TeleTu), in 2008, Vodafone launched in Italy XDSL services, offering Wi-Fi and VoIP to its customers, and between 2013 and 2014, launched also FTTX services.

In 2012 has enabled LTE technology services in Milan and Rome.

On 16 December 2013, following Verizon's sale of the entire share capital held in the company to Vodafone, it was transformed into a *besloten vennootschap* (B.V.).

Between 2014 and 2015, started enabling LTE-A and VoLTE services to its mobile customers, and in 2017 launched LTE-A Pro services in Milan, Palermo and Florence.

On 23 November 2015, the company moved its legal residence in Turin, returning to be a joint-stock company legally registered in Italy.

On 23 January 2017, Vodafone launched the brand Ho Mobile, to provide low-cost mobile telephony services in competition with Iliad.

In 2019 launched 5G NR services in Milan, Rome, Turin, Naples and Bologna. Its *GigaNetwork 5G* is considered the evolution of the previous *GigaNetwork 4.5G*, which has been re-used to launch the 5G service.

In 2021 the company shuts down its 3G network, in order to enhance the 4G and 5G ones.

On March 15, 2024, Swisscom announced its intention to acquire 100% of Vodafone Italia for €8 billion, with the closing expected to take place in the first quarter of 2025, integrating it with its subsidiary Fastweb. As part of the agreement, Vodafone will continue to provide certain services to Fastweb, including brand licensing, for up to five years.

In September 2024, the Antitrust Authority published a notice of investigation and launched an inquiry. Swisscom announced that the European Commission had approved the acquisition of Vodafone Italia under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation. The transaction was subsequently approved by AGCOM and AGCM in November and December 2024, respectively.

In October 2024, CoopVoce signed an agreement with Vodafone to extend mobile network coverage and implement 5G.

On November 15, 2024, Sabrina Casalta, the company's Chief Financial Officer, was appointed interim CEO, replacing Aldo Bisio, who remained a non-executive board member until the completion of the transaction with Swisscom.

On December 31, 2024, Swisscom completed the acquisition of Vodafone Italia, giving rise to Fastweb + Vodafone.


## Ho Mobile

**Ho Mobile** (stylized as **ho.** or **ho-mobile**) is an Italian sub-brand of Vodafone operating as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator. It was created to compete with Iliad in the mobile telephony market.
