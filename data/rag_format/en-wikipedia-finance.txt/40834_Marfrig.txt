## Attention from institutional investors due to Amazon rainforest destruction

Marfrig Global Foods's beef exports has repeatedly implicated in illegal deforestation, as well as indigenous land rights violations and slave labour according to the environmental watchdog Forests and Finance. It has previously been identified as having a problematic beef supply chain fuelling the deforestation of the Amazon forest. The deforestation free supply chain watchdog Forest 500 further identified Marfrig's commitments as being insufficient, with a commitment strength of 9/20 In February 2022, IDB Invest, the private-sector arm of the Inter-American Development Bank shelved a US$200 million loan to Marfrig Global Foods over the group's deforestation impact.

On 21. December 2021 the Government Pension Fund of Norway placed Marfrig under observation "due to risk that the company contributes to serious environmental damage".


## Sponsorship activities

The company was a sponsor of the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the latter held in Marfrig's home country of Brazil.
