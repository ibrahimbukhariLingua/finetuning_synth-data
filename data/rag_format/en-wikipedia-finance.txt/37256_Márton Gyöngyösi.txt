## Political career

Gyöngyösi has been participating in the activity of Jobbik since the autumn of 2006. Within a short time, he has become an advisor to the president of the party, Gábor Vona. On the 2010 elections, he was nominated as a candidate for foreign minister of a future Jobbik government.

From 2003 through 2010, he regularly published articles of political and public interest in Hungarian daily Magyar Nemzet as well as business and economy related publications in business daily Napi Gazdaság. Gyöngyösi was elected MP via the party's national list in the 2010 and 2014 parliamentary elections. Between 2010 and 2018 he served as the vice-chair of the Foreign Committee of the Hungarian National Assembly. He was the leader of the Jobbik's parliamentary group from 2018 to 2019.

In 2019, he was nominated as the lead candidate of Jobbik's European Parliament list. Jobbik received 6.34% of the vote in the European Parliament election, a serious throwback from the 14.67% they received at the last European election in 2014. Despite the setback, the party was able to secure 1 mandate, so that Gyöngyösi was elected to the European Parliament.

Gyöngyösi is member of Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and he is the substitute of Committee on International Trade, Subcommittee on Human Rights and Delegation for relations with the United States.

Following internal disputes, Gyöngyösi was elected leader of the Jobbik on 2 July 2022, acquiring 68 percent of the vote. He defeated István Földi, a confidant of former party president Péter Jakab. Gyöngyösi told "in Hungary, there is no real national and real conservative party on the political spectrum", he wants to lead and build one. He added "my task is to shake up the opposition voters, to shake up the opposition, to show with the leadership of Jobbik that it is indeed possible to offer an alternative to this [Orbán] government".

Following Jobbik's poor result in the 2024 European Parliament election, he announced that he will not run for the party leadership again. In October 2024, he announced his retirement from politics.


## International politics

Gyöngyösi has been a key figure in the transformation of Jobbik to a mainstream party. As the politician of Jobbik in charge of foreign affairs he was the initiator of the Wage Union European Citizens’ Initiative. According to Gyöngyösi the European Union should give more powers to its member states, but close cooperation is necessary.

According to Political Capital, Márton Gyöngyösi was found to be the most hawkish against Russia, regularly condemning authoritarian actions with his votes in Russia, China, Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua – among others.

In December 2022 in the interview given to Ukrainska Pravda Gyöngyösi explained his position on Ukraine and on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

## Controversies

In 2012, as a junior MP in the Parliament, Gyöngyösi suggested that there should be a list of Jews in the National Assembly. Later he apologised, and told that his statement was “a bad sentence, it was a not-well-thought-through sentence, it was a disastrous sentence.”

Gyöngyösi has been accused of antisemitism a couple other times. On a separate occasion he claimed Israel to run on a "Nazi system, based on racial hatred", and declared in an interview when talking about the numbers of Hungarian Jews murdered during the Holocaust that it is a "a fantastic business to jiggle around with the numbers."
