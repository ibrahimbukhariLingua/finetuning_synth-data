IMPACT (Canadian organization)


# IMPACT (Canadian organization)



**IMPACT**, formerly known as **Partnership Africa Canada** (**PAC**) until October 2017, is a non-governmental organization which attempts to control the sourcing of minerals in regions of conflict and campaign against "blood diamonds".


## Zimbabwe

IMPACT claimed that around $2bn (Â£1.26bn) worth of diamonds was stolen by Zimbabwe's rulers, such as the military, police, and "ruling elite", saying that "The scale of illegality is mind-blowing".

IMPACT also claimed that Robert Mugabe gained $2 billion from looting in the Marange diamond fields in 2012. IMPACT went on to say that "This shows Zimbabwe was wilfully in breach of the ... ban on Marange diamonds", following the leaking of a document from the Mineral Marketing Corporation, which detailed the proposed sale of $200 million worth of illegal diamonds through several Zimbabwe banks. This led to criticism from IMPACT, and the Human Rights Watch.


### Diamond sale

Alan Martin went on to criticise major European banks, such as Barclays, for having investments in some of the Zimbabwe banks involved in the sale of diamonds; saying "By facilitating these transactions, Barclays, Stanbic (Standard Bank) and the IFC are participating in diamond-related violence".
