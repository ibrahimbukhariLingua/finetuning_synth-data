## History

Bellroy was founded in 2009 by designers Andrew Fallshaw and Hadrien Monloup, and engineers Lina Calabria and Matthew Fallshaw. Its first products to market were slim wallets. The name Bellroy is derived from the towns of Bells Beach and Fitzroy, where the company has offices. The brand launched its first wallets in August 2010.

In April 2019, Bellroy announced a partnership with Silas Capital, a New York-based growth equity firm that invests in consumer brands; and later that year was valued at $83 million. In 2021 Bellroy was voted Australia's best small business workplace. As of 2023, Bellroy has over 100 employees.
