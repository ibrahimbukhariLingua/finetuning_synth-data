## *Deutschland rundet auf*

The fundraising campaign *Deutschland rundet auf was* founded on November 30, 2009, with the aim to eliminate child poverty in Germany. Consumers can round up their shopping bills to the next 10-cent amount by saying "Aufrunden bitte!" ("Round it up, please!"). Each cent donated goes directly and without any deductions to independently selected and controlled projects to fight child poverty in Germany. More than 4.3 million Euro have been raised as of December 2015. A survey by market research firm IfD Allensbach showed, that after three years in operation, 69% of the German population know *Deutschland rundet auf*.

He has further been recognised with the Best Human Brands Award 2012, the VisionAward 2013, and acknowledged as a "responsible leader" by the BMW Stiftung Herbert Quandt in 2014.
