Tertiary Education Trust Fund


# Tertiary Education Trust Fund



**Tertiary Education Trust Fund**, abbreviated as **TETFUND**, is a scheme established by the Federal Government of Nigeria in 2011 to disburse, manage, and monitor education tax to government-owned tertiary institutions in Nigeria.

The TETFUND scheme was formed as a product of the Education Tax Act of 1993. This Act repeals the Education Tax Act Cap. E4, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 and Education Tax Fund Act No. 17, 2003 and establishes the Tertiary Education Trust Fund charged with the responsibility for imposing, managing and disbursing the tax to public tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Before the establishment of the scheme in 2011, government-owned tertiary institutions were poorly funded. The scheme was designed to improve the management of funds disbursed to these institutions.


## Background

From the 1980s and beyond, the decay of all tiers of education was monumental. Facilities had almost collapsed, teachers and lecturers morale was at its lowest. Enabling environment for conducive teaching and learning was absent. The administration of President, Ibrahim Babangida mindful of the reality of the situation took measures to arrest the rot. In December 1990 the Federal Government constituted the Commission on the Review of Higher Education in Nigeria (the Gray Longe Commission) to review the post-independence Nigerian Higher Education after Lord Ashby's Commission of 1959. The Longe Commission recommended among others the funding of higher education through earmarked tax to be borne by companies operating in Nigeria. An implementation committee under the chairmanship of Professor Olu O. Akinkugbe was constituted to implement Grey Longe's Commission report recommendations also an Agreement was signed between the Federal Government and ASUU on 3 September 1992 on funding of universities. In January 1993, the Education Tax Act No7 of 1993 was promulgated alongside other education-related Decrees. The Decree imposed a 2% tax on the assessable profits of all companies in Nigeria. This was a homegrown solution to address issues of funding to rehabilitate decaying infrastructure, restore the lost glory of education and confidence in the system as well as consolidate the gains thereto; build the capacity of teachers and lecturers; teacher development; development of prototype designs; etc.

The Education Tax Act of No7 of 1993 mandated the Fund to operate as an Intervention Fund to all levels of public education ( Federal, State and Local). This mandate was faithfully discharged between 1999 and May 2011 when the ET Act was repealed and replaced by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund Act, due to lapses and challenges in operating the Education Trust Fund.

These lapses and challenges include:

* The ETF was overburdened and overstretched and could only render palliative support to all levels of public educational institutions in Nigeria;
* Duplication of functions and mandate of other Agencies set up after the ETF, such as Universal Basic Education (UBE) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs);
* The decay, rot and dilapidation of facilities issues in the tertiary education continued to be irritating as Funds are only thinly spread.
