## History

The firm was founded in 1969 by seven attorneys under the age of 35. William D. Zabel, Daniel S. Shapiro, and Paul N. Roth met as associates at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. Roth had worked on a transaction with Stephen J. Schulte, who was an associate at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, and through Schulte, the others met Charles Goldstein, also an associate at Fried Frank. Additionally, Schulte connected the group to Thomas Baer, who was in private practice; and John G. McGoldrick, who was a partner at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler. Burton Lehman, the eighth partner in the new firm, joined the original seven from Cleary Gottlieb shortly after they opened their doors.

The firm's first name was Baer & McGoldrick. In 1977, the name of the firm was changed to Schulte & McGoldrick following Baer's departure. Following McGoldrick's departure in 1981 to become counsel to then-Governor Hugh Carey, the name of the firm was changed to Schulte Roth & Zabel.

The firm's London office, offering American and English law capabilities, launched in 2002. The firm opened its Washington, D.C. office in 2008.
