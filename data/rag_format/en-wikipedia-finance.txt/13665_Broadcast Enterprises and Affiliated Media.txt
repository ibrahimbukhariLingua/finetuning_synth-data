# Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media



**Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media, Inc.** (**BEAM**) is a telecommunications company in the Philippines with primary focus on UHF broadcasting and digital terrestrial television for the convergence of multimedia. It is owned by Bethlehem Holdings, Inc., a media investment company of Globe Telecom through its Retirement Fund group.

The frequency currently used by BEAM (channel UHF 31 of Manila and its provincial outlets) had been previously used by Radio Mindanao Network (under the affiliates CTV-31 (Cinema Television) and E! Philippines) from October 31, 1993, to June 1, 2003, prior to the acquisition by BHI/Globe in 2009.


## History

BEAM was established in 1993 by the Canoy family, owners of Radio Mindanao Network. Its Congressional broadcast franchise was granted in 1995. At that time, it only owned one FM radio station in Dagupan.

In 2009, Bethlehem Holdings Inc., an investment firm of the Globe Telecom Retirement Group Fund, acquired BEAM from the Canoys (coinciding with the acquisition of a large stake in another broadcast firm, Altimax, from Mel Velarde).

Throughout 2014, BEAM began transitioning its analog channels in key cities nationwide to digital broadcast via ISDB-T. Aside from blocktimers, BEAM is now looking for local and foreign partnerships to allocate and generate content up to seven digital free TV channels.

On July 30, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11482 into law which renewed their franchise for another 25 years.
