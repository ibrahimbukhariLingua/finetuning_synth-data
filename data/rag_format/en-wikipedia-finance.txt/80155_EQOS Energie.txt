## History

Founded as "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen mbH" in Stuttgart by Wilhelm Blättchen in 1920, EQOS Energie has a nearly hundred-year-old company history. Back then, the business segment was constituted by electrical and industrial enterprises.
In 1978, the subsidiary "ENERGIE Lignes Hautes Tension" was founded in Luxembourg. 15 years later, the first working group (ARGE) combined their operations with the Austrian “ALPINE Bau GmbH" in a joint venture. In connection with ARGE, a 380-kV forwarding line was set up for the Austrian composite company as were the first steel towers for mobile radio networks. This resulted in the foundation of "ALPINE-ENERGIE Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen GmbH", which is headquartered in Linz, Austria. Due to the foundation of "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für Leitungsbau und Kommunikationstechnik AG" in Bern, the company expanded its business into Switzerland. Entry into the rail sector was marked by "ALPINE ENERGIE’s" launch in the catenary building sector at the Austrian St. Valentin main railway station in 1999. As a result, the catenary lines there were modernised. Three years later, the ALPINE Group took over the shares owned by Blättchen. While founding the "ALPINE-ENERGIE Holding AG" and "ALPINE-ENERGIE Deutschland GmbH", the business expanded and the company grew quickly.

In 2006, the Spanish building group Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC) became majority shareholder of the ALPINE Group. In the same year, "SAG Kommunikationstechnik" was taken over. Through its acquisition of "SAG Kommunikationstechnik", the company extended its business in Switzerland and Austria. Between 2009 and 2011, "ALPINE-ENERGIE" companies were founded in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.

In 2013, the FCC assumed ownership of ALPINE-ENERGIE, which became a subsidiary of FCC. Subsequently, the company was taken over by Triton Fonds in 2014. Since then, the long-established group member has conducted its business under the name of **EQOS Energie**. Following the turnaround, as one of the industry's foremost suppliers, the company realigned its business model in 2015 to address growing market requirements. In a management buy-out, EQOS Energie retired in 2016 from the Swiss market and focused in all service areas on its eight core markets: Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, France, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
