Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council


# Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council



**The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council** (PEBEC) is a specialized agency set up by the President of Nigeria for Nigerian businesses. Its purpose is to make sure that doing business in Nigeria is easy through reforms and policies.


## History

PEBEC was inaugurated in 2016 by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, with the mandate to remove the critical bottleneck and bureaucratic constraints of doing business in Nigeria.

PEBEC collaborates with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and other partners to reduce the costs, time and number of procedures to make the process of setting up and doing business in Nigeria simpler and effective – from starting a business to getting a location to getting finance to dealing with day-to-day operations and ultimately to operating in a secure business environment.

The PEBEC’s regulatory reform program commenced in 2017 as an outcome from the 5th Presidential Quarterly Business Forum hosted by His Excellency, the Vice President at which private sector feedback firmly highlighted some of the regulatory hurdles and the costs associated with regulatory compliance for businesses. On the heels of this, the PEBEC introduced a pilot regulatory reform program focusing on two regulators – National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) and the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) from July 2018.

Since its inception, the business climate reform initiative has recorded tangible impact and measurable results. This includes significant improvements in flagship World Bank Doing Business ranking and being twice recognized as a top 20 improvers in doing business.

The Ease of Doing Business Index (DBI) was an annual ranking done by the World Bank group that objectively assesses prevailing business climate conditions across 190 countries based on 10 indicators (starting a business, getting electricity, enforcing contracts etc.). The index captures ease of doing business reforms that have been validated by the organized private sector and offers comparative insights based on this validation. The rank ranges from 1 - 190. A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and running of a business.

In 2019, Nigeria ranked 131st place in the 2019/20 DBI report and named one of top 10 most improved economies in the world for the 2nd time in 3 years.
