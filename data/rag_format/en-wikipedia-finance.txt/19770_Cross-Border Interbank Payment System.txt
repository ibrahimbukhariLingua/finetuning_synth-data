The **Cross-border Interbank Payment System** (**CIPS**) is a Chinese payment system that offers clearing and settlement services for its participants in cross-border renminbi (RMB) payments and trade. CIPS is backed by the People's Bank of China and was launched in 2015 as part of a policy effort to internationalize the use of China’s currency.

In 2022, CIPS processed around 96.7 trillion yuan ($14.03 trillion), with about 1427 financial institutions in 109 countries and regions having connected to the system.

In 2023, the CIPS processed 6.6133 million transactions, totaling RMB123.06 trillion($17.09 trillion), increasing by 50.29 percent and 27.27 percent y-o-y, respectively. On a daily basis, the system processed 25,900 transactions, totaling RMB482.602 billion($67.028 billion).

As of December 2024, CIPS has 168 Direct Participants and 1461 Indirect Participants. Among Indirect Participants, 1072 participants are from Asia (including 560 from Chinese Mainland), 252 from Europe, 56 from Africa, 31 from North America, 19 from Oceania, and 31 from South America.

CIPS participants are located in 119 countries and regions around the world. Business covers more than 4,800 banking institutions in 185 countries and regions around the world.


## History

In 2012, the PBOC launched the construction of CIPS (phase 1). On 8 October 2015, CIPS (phase 1) was put into operation, with 19 direct participants and 176 indirect participants from 50 countries and regions across 6 continents. The launch of CIPS was another milestone in the construction of China's financial market infrastructure, which marked vital progress in developing China's modern payment system that integrated domestic, and overseas payments of RMB. CIPS significantly facilitated RMB being officially included in the special drawing rights (SDR).

In March 2016, SWIFT and CIPS signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU). With the ISO 20022 standard already adopted by CIPS for its payment system, SWIFT went through the implementation process of the standard that can allow the use of Chinese characters, in addition to its richer content functionalities.

In September 2017, as one of the MOU's plans signed between SWIFT and CIPS, reference data indicating financial institutions’ direct and indirect participation in CIPS will be published via SWIFTRef and updated on a monthly basis. This data covers BIC, LEI, national bank codes, IBAN data, standing settlement instructions, credit ratings, and financial institutions’ memberships to domestic and cross-border payment market infrastructures.

After the launch of CIPS (phase 1), its functions have been steadily improved, leading to its operation (phase 2).

On 26 March 2018, CIPS (phase 2) was launched on a pilot basis, with 10 direct participants. On 2 May 2018, CIPS (phase 2) was fully operational with other qualified direct participants. On 9 October, CIPS (phase 2) implemented the Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement and supported Northbound Trading of Bond Connect, which would reduce settlement risks and improve the efficiency of cross-border bond transactions.

By the end of 2019, CIPS had 33 direct and 903 indirect participants (from 94 countries and regions) with an increase of 74% and 413% compared to 2015, respectively. Through these direct and indirect participants, the network of CIPS has reached 3000+ banking institutions in 167 countries and regions. By the end of 2019, 1017 banking institutions from 59 BRI countries and regions (including mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, and Taiwan) ran their business via CIPS.

In 2021, CIPS processed around 80 trillion yuan ($12.68 trillion), with about 1280 financial institutions in 103 countries and regions having connected to the system.

In 2022, CIPS processed around 96.7 trillion yuan ($14.03 trillion), with about 1427 financial institutions in 109 countries and regions having connected to the system.

In 2023, the CIPS processed 6.6133 million transactions, totaling RMB123.06 trillion($17.09 trillion), increasing by 50.29 percent and 27.27 percent y-o-y, respectively. On a daily basis, the system processed 25,900 transactions, totaling RMB482.602 billion($67.028 billion).


## Standards

CIPS relies on SWIFT's messaging service for over 80% of its transactions. It uses the SWIFT industry standard for syntax in financial messages. Messages formatted to SWIFT standards can be read and processed by many well-known financial processing systems, whether or not the message traveled over the SWIFT network. SWIFT cooperates with international organizations to define standards for message format and content. CIPS also subscribes to *registration authority* (RA) for the following ISO standards:

* ISO 9362: 1994 Banking—Banking telecommunication messages—Bank identifier codes
* ISO 10383: 2003 Securities and related financial instruments—Codes for exchanges and market identification (MIC)
* ISO 13616: 2003 IBAN Registry
* ISO 15022: 1999 Securities—Scheme for messages (Data Field Dictionary) (replaces ISO 7775)
* ISO 20022-1: 2004 and ISO 20022-2:2007 Financial services—UNIversal Financial Industry message scheme

In RFC 3615 *urn:swift:* was defined as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) for SWIFT FIN.

As of December 2024, CIPS has 168 Direct Participants and 1461 Indirect Participants. Among Indirect Participants, 1072 participants are from Asia (including 560 from Chinese Mainland), 252 from Europe, 56 from Africa, 31 from North America, 19 from Oceania, and 31 from South America.

CIPS participants are located in 119 countries and regions around the world. Business covers more than 4,800 banking institutions in 185 countries and regions around the world.

CIPS has Chinese and international shareholders. The People's Bank of China is the largest shareholder with 16 percent of equity; others include the NAFMII, UnionPay, and the large state-owned Chinese banks.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Foreign shareholders include HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia, DBS Bank, Citigroup, ANZ Banking Group, and BNP Paribas.

As academic Tim Beal summarizes, CIPS is among the responses to sanctions imposed by the United States, which commentators view as contributing to de-dollarization.
