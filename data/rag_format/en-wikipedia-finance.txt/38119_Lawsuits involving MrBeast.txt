Lawsuits involving MrBeast


# Lawsuits involving MrBeast



This is a partial list of lawsuits involving American YouTuber, internet personality, and businessman James Stephen Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, and the brands and companies he owns.


### MrBeast Burger

On July 31, 2023, Donaldson filed a lawsuit against Virtual Dining Concepts for breach of contract. Donaldson's complaint stated his belief that the company behind his chain has failed to uphold the quality he so desired, alleging that it was more focused on its own growth than the quality of the venture's product. The filing also stated that Virtual Dining Concepts trademarked MrBeast without the knowledge of Donaldson, and because of such, Donaldson has not received any compensation from MrBeast Burger.

Virtual Dining's lawyers quickly dismissed the complaints and alleged that Donaldson's allegations are "riddled with false statements and inaccuracies", noting that Donaldson recently attempted to negotiate a new contract with Virtual Dining. The firm, represented by Greenberg Traurig, further claims that Donaldson used "bullying tactics" in order to escape from his existing contractual obligations without sensible reasoning. Virtual Dining "had hoped Mr. Donaldson would act honorably", but said he had "elevated greed over his word and the truth", and that he "will face the consequences in court when Virtual Dining files it [*sic*] claims against him". The case will be heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with no judge assigned as of yet.


### Class action lawsuit

In September 2024, a class action lawsuit on behalf of five former contestants of Beast Games was filed against Donaldson (under his company MrB2024, LLC), Off One’s Base, LLC, Amazon Alternative, LLC, and 100 anonymous individuals in Los Angeles Superior Court. The lawsuit alleged that the Beast Games contestants experienced widespread mistreatment, sexual harassment, and unpaid expenses and wages. The lawsuit also alleged that these violations occurred for the purpose of gaining Nevada tax credits: “Plaintiffs and the Proposed Class [were forced] to enter into illegal contracts and provid[e] false information to the State of Nevada to obtain unearned tax credits.”


### Dees Nuts lawsuit

On August 25, 2023, Dees Nuts LLC, a Florida-based peanut company, filed a lawsuit against Feastables LLC, the company used to handle Donaldson's snack brand Feastables. Dees Nuts alleged Feastables of trademark infringement, as Feastables used "Deez Nuts" as one of their chocolate bar flavours. This name is similar both in spelling and phonetically to "Dee's Nuts", a trademark that Dees Nuts LLC has held since September 25, 2012.³ The court ordered on December 6, 2023 that Feastables cease all use of the "Deez Nuts" name.
