Global Enabling Trade Report


# Global Enabling Trade Report



The ***Global Enabling Trade Report*** was first published in 2008 by the World Economic Forum.

The 2008 report covers 118 major and emerging economies. At the core of the report is the Enabling Trade Index which ranks the countries using data from different sources (e.g., World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey, International Trade Centre, World Bank, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), IATA, ITU, Global Express Association).

The Enabling Trade Index measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destination. It is made up of four sub-indexes:

1. Market access
2. Border administration
3. Transport and communications infrastructure
4. Business environment

Each of these sub-indexes contains two to three pillars that assess different aspects of a country's trade environment.
