## Description

iAsiaWorks began as a Taiwan & Korean ISP called AUNet, raised additional capital, and purchased AT&T's Hong Kong ISP business in early 2000. The newly merged company offered leased line and datacenter space to companies across Asia Pacific, but with a particular focus on Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. In each of these markets it built 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m²) datacenter facilities, which remained mostly empty until it closed in mid to late 2001. The facilities were built to the highest specifications available in Asia. In the fall of 2001 iAsiaWork's facility in Seoul was purchased by Dacom where it consolidated its 'KIDC' operations. Its former facility in Hong Kong was occupied by Singtel. The status of the facility in Taiwan remains unknown.
