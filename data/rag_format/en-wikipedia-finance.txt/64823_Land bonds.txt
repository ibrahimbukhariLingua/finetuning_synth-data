Land bonds


# Land bonds



**Land bonds** are financial bonds used in many countries to satisfy, in whole or in part, the compensation payable by the government for compulsory acquisition of any land from private landowners.

Land bonds are normally issued under the provisions of land bonds act of a state government or the central government.

The municipal government may pay for the land in public debt bonds, redeemable within up to ten years, in equal and successive annual installments, ensuring the real value of the compensation and the legal interest.
* Article 184, which states that it is within the power of the state to acquire, on account of social interest, a rural property against prior and fair compensation in agrarian bonds with a clause providing for maintenance of the real value, redeemable within a period of up to twenty years computed as from the second year of issue, and the use of which shall be defined in the law.

The law mandates that new land bonds issued to a vendor for the acquired land, be accepted by such vendor as the equivalent of the corresponding amount of purchase money, and any person having power to sell, may enter into a subsequent purchase agreement notwithstanding that the purchase money under the laws of Ireland is paid in new land bonds instead of cash.
