## History

GFI Group Inc. was founded by Michael Gooch in 1987. GFI was the first broker to offer over-the-counter (OTC) US government bond options to the industry. In 2001, GFI acquired FX analytical software company FENICS Software Ltd. In 2005, GFI acquired the North American operations of Starsupply Petroleum LLC, a broker of oil products and related derivative and option contracts. In 2006 the firm acquired the North American brokerage operations of Amerex Energy, a wholesale broker of electric power, natural gas and emissions products. In 2008, GFI acquired Trayport Ltd, a leading provider of trading software for OTC energy products and other markets.

In 2010, GFI Group moved its listing from Nasdaq to the NYSE.

In March 2015, GFI delisted from the NYSE following a 56% share buyout by BGC Partners in February 2015. Since the takeover, GFI operates as a division of BGC. In April 2018, a federal judge threw out a lawsuit against GFI Group by former GFI Group shareholders, who claimed a statement by the CEO had resulted in them selling their shares too early.
