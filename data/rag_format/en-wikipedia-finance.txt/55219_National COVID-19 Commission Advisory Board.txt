National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board


# National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board



The **National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board** (**NCC**) was the Australian Government strategic advisory board for the national economic recovery to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally formed as the **National COVID-19 Coordination Commission** on 25 March 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the body as responsible for advising the government on public–private partnerships and coordination to mitigate the social and economic impacts of the pandemic in Australia. On 22 July 2020, the commission was renamed the National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board to better reflect the advisory, not executive, nature of the body.
