## Controversies


### Email fraud

In December 2017, Gaw Capital transferred HK$39 million ($5 million) from a client's bank account to the bank account of a fraudster. The fraudster posed as a client and sent instructions to the firm for the withdrawal of funds. The firm discovered what had happened after the actual client contacted it. A spokesperson for Gaw Capital stated the bank account in question was frozen and most of the funds transferred were retrieved.


### Lawsuit over The Standard High Line hotel

In November 2017, Gaw Capital acquired The Standard High Line hotel in New York for $323 million. In November 2021, Wells Fargo and Apollo Global Management sued Gaw Capital in attempt to foreclose the hotel after the firm failed to make payments on a $170 million loan since May 2020. Gaw Capital stated that the fault lied with Apollo Global Management who refused to accept the firm's settlement offer and put financial greed above all the other parties.
