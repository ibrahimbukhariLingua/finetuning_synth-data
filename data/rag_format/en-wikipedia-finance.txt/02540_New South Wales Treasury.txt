New South Wales Treasury


# New South Wales Treasury



**The Treasury of New South Wales**, branded **NSW Treasury**, a department of the New South Wales Government, is responsible for state financial management policy and reporting, and providing advice to the government on economic conditions and issues in New South Wales, Australia. NSW Treasury was established in April 1824 and is the oldest continuing government agency in Australia.


## Core responsibilities

Management of NSW finances

* consistent collection and consolidation of financial information from public entities
* strong financial management through accurate data and advice
* effective delivery of the Budget and other financial reports, on behalf of the Treasurer.

Analysis, advice and delivery

* informed fiscal, economic, commercial and financial policy advice
* innovative reforms which support a strong and competitive economy
* providing fair and productive industrial relations and public sector wages policies
* robust risk management and governance frameworks.

Management of NSW assets

* value-creating commercial and financial transactions
* respected commercial, financial and service delivery reforms
* market-leading analysis and advice on private financing of public infrastructure
* managing, monitoring and advising on the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector commercial agencies.

Efficient management of NSW's cash resources is a key responsibility of Treasury. A policy & guidelines paper published by Treasury in 2010 ('*TPP10-2 Treasury Banking System Cash Forecasting and Banking Arrangements*') provided the state's agencies with relevant information in relation to cash forecasting requirements and banking arrangements. In 2015, the Expenditure Review Committee of the state's Cabinet directed that public sector agencies (excluding state-owned corporations and authorities specifically approved by the NSW Treasurer) would, from 1 April 2015, operate as part of the Treasury Banking System. This decision applied to all agency cash deposits held ‘at call’.
