In 2000, Mooney, having recently been made chairman of Disney Consumer Products Worldwide, went to see a Disney on Ice show in Phoenix, Arizona, where he saw little girls dressed as princesses, wearing handmade gowns with mismatched jewelry. Though he noted the deep affection for the characters with which these outfits were made, he imagined that ones assembled professionally by Disney could be lucrative. He packaged the Disney Princesses under a single brand, which sold items such as a yellow organza Belle costume, Sleeping Beauty pajamas and matching accessories. As of 2011, the franchise is a $4 billion-a-year brand featuring 26,000 products.

In early 2001, his executive assistant, Pamela, brought him an idea of creating a line of wedding dresses inspired by the Disney Princesses. Giving the go-ahead, Pamela approached Vera Wang for the opportunity to design the gowns. Ms. Wang declined the opportunity, which resulted in Mooney pulling together a group of Disney creative people. Under Mooney's leadership this team, the Disney Global Creative team created he Disney Fairy Tale Weddings line. The wedding dresses are inspired by the princess characters, and they later were designed by Kirstie Kelly.

Mooney announced his resignation from Disney on September 6, 2011, to pursue interests with other companies.

In March 2012, Mooney joined the Board of shopkick, the mobile shopping application, along with Kleiner Perkins and Reid Hoffman.

In January 2013, Quiksilver announced that Mooney would be its new president and chief executive officer, replacing Bob McKnight. On March 27, 2015, Quiksilver announced the termination of Mooney as CEO of the company. He was replaced as CEO by Pierre Agnes, who had worked at Quiksilver for 27 years and was promoted to president in November 2014.

On June 2, 2015, Mooney was appointed CEO of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, replacing Scott Gilbertson. As part of Mooney's strategy to concentrate on Digital assets rather than manufacture, Fender re-located to Los Angeles, California and heavily invested in expertise to bring Mooney's vision to fruition. No published information exists on the Return On Investment (ROI) for Fender Play, Fender Songs, Fender Academy or Mooney's digital strategy in general. Fender's manufacturing continues to re-brand/rename existing product lines in order to take advantage of competition law and new product introduction price protection. In January 2020 Fender were fined £4.5 million ($5.9 million) for breaking British competition law. The fine is the largest ever imposed by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for price fixing, or what it terms as "resale price maintenance".

In the fall of 2015 Mooney executed the re-structure of Fender Musical Instruments Europe (FMIE) set up in the early 2000s by Bill Schultz and Bill Mendello with the appointment of Graeme Mathieson as FMIE Managing Director.
