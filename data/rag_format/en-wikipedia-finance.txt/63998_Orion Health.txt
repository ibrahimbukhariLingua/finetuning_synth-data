## History

The company founder and former CEO is Ian McCrae.
In 2022, Brad Porter was appointed as the current CEO. The company's head office is in Grafton, Auckland, New Zealand. Orion Health was a privately owned company for over 20 years. Orion Health became a public organisation on 26 November 2014 when it listed on the NZX. It has not registered a profit since, and in April 2017 market analysts were suggesting that it was in serious trouble. The company said it was looking for a capital injection from new investors. In February 2018, Orion Health launched a cloud-based Rhapsody integration on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In March 2019 shares were compulsorily acquired by Ian McCrae for $1.224 per share, a large drop from their $5.70 IPO share price causing widespread losses to early investors. Orion Health was then de-listed from the Australian Stock Exchange and the New Zealand Stock Exchange, becoming again a privately held company.

In 2016 Orion Health partnered with the University of Auckland and the Waitemata District Health Board to develop one of New Zealand's largest data science research initiatives called Precision Driven Health In 2017 the Precision Driven Health partnership received the Research and Business Partnership Award at the KiwiNet Research Commercialisation Awards.

In 2019 Orion Health delivered the first Health Information Exchange (HIE) in the Middle East. The system allows health providers to view and store data for more than 50 million people. This is expected to be the "world's largest" HIE containing data from approximately 5,000 private and government healthcare providers.
