# Erste & Steiermärkische Bank



**Erste & Steiermärkische Bank d.d.**, also known as **Erste Bank Croatia**, is a bank in Croatia, with registered office in Rijeka and operational headquarters in Zagreb. In 2020, it was Croatia's third-largest bank by total assets. It is jointly owned by Erste Group Bank and Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkassen, both members of the Austrian Savings Banks Group.


## Overview

In 1998, Erste Bank acquired three local banks in Croatia, respectively Bjelovarska Banka (est. 1954) in Bjelovar, Trgovacka Banka (est. 1990) in Zagreb, and Cakovecka Banka (est. 1995) in Čakovec. In September 2000, the three banks were integrated into a single entity, named Erste & Steiermärkische Bank (ESB), which became a member of Erste Group. In May 2002, ESB purchased Riječka banka (est. 1954), headquartered in Rijeka. Following that transaction, the entity's registered office has been maintained in Rijeka.

As of end-2023, Erste Group Bank held 59 percent of the equity capital of ESB, and Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkassen held 41 percent. Since the former also owns 25 percent of the latter, the economic interest of Erste Group Bank in ESB amounts to 69.25 percent.
