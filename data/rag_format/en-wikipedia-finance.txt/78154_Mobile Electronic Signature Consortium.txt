Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium


# Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium



**Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium** (**mSign**) was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an XMl-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber.

In 2001, mSign gained industry-wide coverage when it became apparent that Brokat, a company of one of the founders, also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures.


## Technologies used

The mSign consortium created the standards on the assumption that a WAP phone with a WAP 1.2 implementation and digital keys stored on the SIM card (i.e. WIM) would be used to generate a mobile (digital) signature. During the standardization process, room was given also to other mechanisms for authenticating the mobile phone subscriber such as the sending of a password via SMS or Dialtone communication and voice identification. The specification also allowed for server-based digital signatures. In other words, digital signatures not generated in the mobile phone but on a central server that would then communicate with the signature requesting Service Providers via the mSign interface.
