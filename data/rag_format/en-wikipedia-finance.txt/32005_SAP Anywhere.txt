SAP Anywhere


# SAP Anywhere



**SAP Anywhere** is a front office software package from SAP for small and medium sized enterprises (SMBs). In early 2018, SAP decided to sunset the product in favor of its other software packages SAP Business One and SAP Business ByDesign ERP.

SAP Anywhere is a package of several front office applications that are intended to help businesses sell products and services in-store, through direct sales and online. This combination is marketed to businesses as helping them to achieve effective customer relationship management by allowing them to review and direct marketing, inventory, and customer experiences using a single system on their mobile devices.


## History

SAP Anywhere was launched by SAP and China Telecom on 20 October 2015, in Mainland China. SAP utilized the telecommunications infrastructure of China Telecom, and states that it developed a product customized for the Chinese market. According to SAP, initial plans for release focused on building a strong customer base in China before expanding to other markets. Due competitive pressure (according to SAP), SAP released SAP Anywhere to the English-speaking market earlier than planned. UK availability was announced in March 2016, and US availability was announced in May 2016. A Canadian pilot was planned for 2016.


## Features

SAP Anywhere is a cloud based SaaS, and can be accessed through mobile devices or desktops. It includes applications for: online stores, customer relationship management, digital marketing, Point of Sale, order fulfillment management, and inventory management.
