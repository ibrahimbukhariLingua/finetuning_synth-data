# Volodymyr Matvienko



**Volodymyr Pavlovych Matvienko** (Ukrainian: Володи́мир Па́влович Матвіє́нко; born 5 January 1938) is a Ukrainian poet-songwriter, economist and politician who is a recipient of both the Hero of Ukraine and Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise. Additionally, he was the first chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) from 1991 to 1992.


## Early life and education

Born on 5 January 1938, in the Ukrainian village of Bilka. Matvienko completed his postgraduate studies at the Kyiv Institute of National Economy in 1967 after earning a degree in finance and credit from the Kyiv Financial and Economic Institute in 1959. He was given the academic title of professor in 1992. He was given the title of professor of the department of banking in 1992 by the Kyiv Institute of National Economy.


## Career

His career journey began in July 1959 when he started as a credit inspector at the Zhdaniv branch of the Budbank of the USSR in the Donetsk Oblast. Progressing steadily, he became the manager of the Artemivske branch in 1964, later assuming roles such as deputy manager of the Donetsk regional office, manager of the Dnipropetrovsk regional office, and eventually deputy manager of the Ukrainian SSR office of the Budbank of the USSR, where he served from 1982 to 1987.

Transitioning to higher positions, he took on the role of chairman of the board of the Ukrainian Republic Bank of Prombudbank of the USSR from 1987 to 1991. In 1991, Matvienko's career trajectory shifted significantly when he was appointed chairman of the board of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). Notably, he implemented innovative measures such as reusable coupons to counteract inflation in the early 1990s, effectively averting a severe cash crisis in Ukraine.

On 6 June 1991, Matvienko was elected as the first chairman of the NBU board by deputies with almost unanimous consent. He noted that the national bank operated under harsh, conflicting circumstances, much like the fledgling state of Ukraine. Nonetheless, the NBU completed many other responsibilities associated with the establishment of the state's central bank, including the formation of a domestic monetary system, a system of credit control, a mechanism for supporting international economic activity, and monetary settlements.

In September 1991, the Government Courier newspaper published an article in which Matvienko discussed the state of affairs at the moment, pointing out that the intricacy of the money issue extends beyond simple manufacturing. Should they launch their own currency, certain legal acts will need to be developed and enacted. Establish the notion of monetary reform, the pricing structure, and the new monetary unit's exchange rate to foreign currencies.

Direct work was done on the hryvnia's creation at the same period. The hryvnia currency design was created by Ukrainian painters Vasyl Lopata and Boris Maksimov, and Matvienko authorized prototypes of the first bills. He signed large banknotes that Thomas de la Rue printed in London.

Maksimov's influence continued to shape the banking landscape as in 1992, the corporatization of Budbank led to the establishment of the Ukrainian Joint Stock Commercial Industrial and Investment Bank (Prominvestbank), with him as its principal shareholder. He would go on to establish the Kyiv Institute of Banking in 1997 and served as its permanent rector for 14 years.

Later in his life, Professor Matvienko holds honorary membership in the Ukrainian Academy of Architecture, Ukrainian Academy of Economic Cybernetics, Ukrainian Environmental Academy of Sciences, full membership in the Ukrainian Academy of Engineering Sciences, and academician status in the Academy of Economic Sciences.
