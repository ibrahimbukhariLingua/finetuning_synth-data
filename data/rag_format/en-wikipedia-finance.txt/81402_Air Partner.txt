## History

Air Partner was founded in 1961 by Tony Mack Senior trading as Airways Training. It began as a school for military pilots converting to civilian flying using flight simulators and a fleet of Beagles.

Following the years as a flying school, Air Partner formed an air taxi operation with a fleet of Chieftain, Piper Aztec, 125 and C550 aircraft. At this time the company name was changed to Air London to reflect the change in business focus.

In 1983 the company surrendered its Air Operator’s Licence to concentrate on aircraft broking. In 1999 Air London became Air Partner.

Air Partner Plc was acquired by Wheels Up in April 2022.
