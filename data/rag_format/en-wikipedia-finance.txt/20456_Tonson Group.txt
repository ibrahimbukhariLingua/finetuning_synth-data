## Involvement with Rama III District

Chachchon’s father Krit Ratanarak is reported to be taking a lead in the development of Bangkok’s Rama III Riverside district in the central south west of the city. The Rama III area was referred to as the Wall Street of Bangkok before the 1996 financial crisis. Today it is again regarded as an up-and-coming district of central Bangkok amid long-term moves to redevelop the area in the same fashion as London’s Canary Wharf. In 2010, the Rama III area saw the second highest increase in condominium prices in central Bangkok after the central business district.

The Rama III area has ample undeveloped land in large parcels that runs along the river and some of the city’s best transport infrastructure, including the Bhumibol Bridge named after Thailand’s king who inaugurated the new bridge in 2010. Rama III has been identified by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration as part of a zone to be developed as a model of environmentally friendly mass transit system. The Rama III riverside area was unaffected by the severe flooding that submerged many areas of Bangkok in November 2011.

Tonson Group’s first development in Rama III is an ultra-prime condominium project called The Sathu Residences.
