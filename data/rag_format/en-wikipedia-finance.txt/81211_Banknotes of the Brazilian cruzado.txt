Banknotes of the Brazilian cruzado


# Banknotes of the Brazilian cruzado



In 1986 because of inflation banknotes of the cruzado were issued by Central Bank of Brazil in denominations of 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10 000 cruzados. This bank had the sole authority to issue cruzado notes and Casa da Moeda do Brasil was the sole printer of these banknotes.²⁹–³⁵ Cruzado notes on the front/obverse featured prominent people while on the back/reverse depicted buildings and/or activities of those people mentioned before. Between 1989 and 1990 cruzado currency had also been replaced, this time by *cruzado novo* at a rate of 1 cruzado to 1000 cruzados novos.


## History

The name cruzado was inspired by the name of an old Portuguese silver coin, which had value of 400/480 réis and that circulated in the time in which Brazil was still a colony of Portugal.
On 28 February 1986 cruzado currency was created by José Sarney, the 31st president of Brazil, when Dilson Funaro was the minister of Finance, through Cruzado plan as part of a set of economic measures to freeze wages and prices. It was marked by return of *centavo* as a subdivision of the currency, since it had been abolished in 1984, due to devaluation of the cruzeiro (second).
