## Career

Originally wholesale clothiers in their father's firm, Ratshesky and his brother Israel founded the United States Trust Company in 1895 as "the Jewish bank" because of the "needs of the rising immigrant population by providing access to capital and banking services not otherwise available to these individuals." Abraham served as President and Israel served as Treasurer. He served as a Massachusetts State Senator from 1892-1895 and as a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1892, 1904, 1908, 1916, and 1924.
