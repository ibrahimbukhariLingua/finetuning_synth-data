# List of free-trade zones in Dubai



**Free-trade zones in Dubai**, (FTZs) are special economic zones set up with the objective of offering tax concessions and customs duty benefits to expatriate investors. There are 26 Free Zones operating in Dubai. FTZs in Dubai and the UAE are governed pursuant to a special framework of rules and regulations. A Free Zone Authority offers business licenses to foreign-owned businesses. Each Free Zone is designed around one or more industry categories and only offers licenses (e.g. for a Free Zone Enterprise (FZE)), to companies within those categories. Most of the free zones in Dubai broadly offer trading, services, and industrial licenses to investors looking to set up their businesses.
