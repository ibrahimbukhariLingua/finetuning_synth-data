Power Lunch


# Power Lunch



***Power Lunch*** is a television business news program on CNBC, airing between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. Eastern Time. It is presented by Brian Sullivan and Kelly Evans.


## History

Bill Griffeth anchored the program alone from 1996 to 2002. Caruso-Cabrera joined as Griffeth's original co-presenter from February 4, 2002 to December 5, 2003, before being replaced by Sue Herera, who debuted three days later. Caruso-Cabrera and Dennis Kneale appeared regularly in their respective analyst capacities until both became full co-presenters in 2009. Mathisen joined the program on December 14, 2009, after Griffeth's leave of absence began.

*Power Lunch* originally aired for two hours (noon to 2 ET) until June 7, 2010, when it moved to 1 ET, with its run-time cut to 1 hour, making room for *The Strategy Session* at noon ET and the *Fast Money Halftime Report* at 12:30 ET. The show became a 2-hour program once again on February 9, 2015, with run-time then from 1-3 p.m. ET, replacing *Street Signs* (which aired its final edition three days prior). Sullivan and Amanda Drury, both of whom previously co-anchored *Street Signs*, joined the program the same day, along with current *Fast Money* and *Options Action* host Melissa Lee. They replaced Herera, who left three days earlier. Caruso-Cabrera rejoined the program for her third stint as co-presenter on January 19, 2016 after Amanda Drury's departure from CNBC U.S. (in the case of the latter, she rejoined CNBC Asia as a Sydney-based correspondent that July). On March 12, 2018, Sara Eisen (previously co-anchor of *Worldwide Exchange* and later co-anchor of *Squawk on the Street*, now co-anchor of *Closing Bell*) and Brian Sullivan swapped their respective anchor roles, with Eisen moving to *Power Lunch* and Sullivan moving to *Worldwide Exchange*. On November 30, 2018, Eisen and Kelly Evans swapped their respective anchor roles, with the former moving to *Closing Bell* and Evans moving to *Power Lunch*. On January 7, 2019 *Power Lunch* was halved in length due to the launch of a new program, *The Exchange*, presented by Kelly Evans. Consequently, *Power Lunch* is once again a 60-minute program, running between 2 pm and 3 pm ET. On December 23, 2024, Sullivan returned to *Power Lunch* as co-anchor to replace the departed Tyler Mathisen, who semi-retired from CNBC on December 20, 2024.

On October 13, 2014, *Power Lunch* was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox format.
