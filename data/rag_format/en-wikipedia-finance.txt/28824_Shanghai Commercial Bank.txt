Shanghai Commercial Bank


# Shanghai Commercial Bank



The **Shanghai Commercial Bank** (SCB; Chinese: 上海商業銀行) is an international bank based in Hong Kong. Its subsidiary companies offer banking and financial services across the world, but mainly in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The bank was founded by Chen Guangfu (K. P. Chen) in 1915.

As a group, it employs over 1,790 people. The bank is a financial institution incorporated in Hong Kong. The address of its registered headquarters is 12 Queen's Road Central, Central, Hong Kong.


## History

Historically, the Shanghai Commercial Bank was founded in Shanghai in 1915 under the leadership of K.P. Chen (1881–1976), a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance. In 1927, the Shanghai Commercial Bank established a travel service division, which later became the independent China Travel Service. The bank expanded in the late 1920s and early 1930s, endured the period of Japanese aggression, but suffered significant set-backs during the Chinese Civil War.

In 1950, with the new Communist government intent on nationalising the banking industry in mainland China, the Hong Kong branch of the Shanghai Commercial Bank was separately incorporated in Hong Kong as the **Shanghai Commercial Bank**. The bank's assets in mainland China were compulsorily acquired by the government. In 1954, the bank was permitted to re-register in Taiwan as the **Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank** (SCSB), retaining a majority shareholding in the Hong Kong bank. Both parts of the bank, in Hong Kong and Taiwan, rebuilt themselves from the 1960s-1980s as both economies prospered.

In 1995, the Shanghai City Credit Union in mainland China was converted to a bank, the Shanghai City Cooperative Bank, which was subsequently renamed the Bank of Shanghai. The SCB has acquired a 3% stake in the Bank of Shanghai, symbolically re-establishing its link to banking in Shanghai.

In 2011, the three "Banks of Shanghai" entered into a cooperation agreement. The link between the three banks is emphasised in some marketing materials, with the slogan "Bank of Shanghai in 3 regions on both sides of the Strait".


## Headquarter Building

In 2008, SCB bought the CNAC Group building at 10 Queen's Road Central, adjacent to its then headquarters building for further expansion. The purchase of CNAC building costed HK$1.388 billion for gross area of 70,00 square feet, and SCB intended to invest another 500 to 600 HKD Million to redevelop it along with the building at 12 Queen's Road Central as the new headquarters tower. The expected gross space will increase to 140,000 square feet.

The new tower opened in September 2016 including opening of its flagship retail branch at the basement of the tower.


## Services

Moreover, the bank has been issuing floating rate certificates of deposit which were well received by the market since early 1994.

## Financial Position and Strategic Outlook


### 2009 Financial Position and 2010 Outlook

The consolidated profit attributable to shareholders, in 2009, was HK$1,336 million, representing a gain of 12.7 percent. The increase was primarily due to the substantially lower impairment allowances, positive contributions from all the jointly controlled entities, improved fee income from securities related business and treasury operation. The return on average total assets and return on average equity stood at 1.2 percent and 8.7 percent respectively. Capital adequacy ratio remained strong at 19 percent, while the liquidity ratio was 55 percent. The additional compensation made for the Lehman Brothers Minibonds Repurchase Scheme had a negative impact on the bank's cost-to-income ratio and it increased to 43.7 percent. Excluding the additional compensation, the ratio would have been 34.9 percent; in 2008, it was 34.3 percent.

The bank is obtaining the necessary approval to upgrade the Shanghai representative office to full branch status. Also, the bank is committed to the “Green Channel”, a convenient one-stop platform of premium banking services in the Greater China region, for the VIP customers of the three banks: Shanghai Commercial Bank in Hong Kong, Bank of Shanghai on mainland China and The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank in Taiwan. The redevelopment project of the Head Office building, together with the adjacent plot, is proceeding on course. The bank has engaged the award-winning Rocco Design Architects Limited as the project's architectural firm. The general building plan is expected to be finalised some time in 2010 and demolition of the current structures will commence in mid-2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
