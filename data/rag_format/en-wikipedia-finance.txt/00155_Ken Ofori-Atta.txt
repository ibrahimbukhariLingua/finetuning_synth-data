He also was a Director at the International Bank and is also a board member of the Acumen Fund.


## Political career

Ofori-Atta was President Nana Akufo-Addo’s nominee to assess the health of the economy during the transition period after the 2016 elections.

In May 2017, Akufo-Addo named Ken Ofori-Atta as part of nineteen ministers who would form his cabinet. The names of the 19 ministers were submitted to the Parliament of Ghana and were announced by the Speaker of the House, Aaron Mike Oquaye. As a cabinet minister, Ken Ofori-Atta was an integral part of the inner circle of president Akufo-Addo.

Ofori-Atta was elected Chair of the World Bank/IMF Development Committee at the 2018 Spring Meetings and also Chairs the Governing Board of the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF). In addition, he Chaired the African Caucus at the World Bank.

During his time in office, Ofori-Atta oversaw Ghana's debt restructuring efforts after the country defaulted on most of its external debt in December 2022.


## Parliamentary Motion of Censure

On 25 October 2022, 80 out of the 137 New Patriotic Party (NPP) lawmakers dared President Nana Akufo-Addo to sack Ofori-Atta as Finance Minister citing his inability to properly handle the Ghanaian economy. Akufo-Addo sacked Ofori-Atta's deputy over corruption claims but kept Ofori-Atta at post saying that there is no basis for sacking him.

In November 2022, a motion of censure was started to remove Ofori-Atta from office due to the decline of Ghana's economy, leading to the Ghanaian cedi being ranked as one of the worst in the world. The motion failed as it was not able to gain two-thirds majority to pass, securing only 136 votes out of 275 votes.


### IMF Bailout

In May 2021, Ofori-Atta in a press conference indicated that Ghana will not seek the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing the rising debt situation. This was on the back of the Government of Ghana's ambitious agenda of 'Ghana Beyond Aid' unveiled in 2018 by President Akufo-Addo. However, a press statement issued by the Finance Ministry indicated the Government of Ghana's engagement with the IMF for assistance in managing its debts to sustainable levels after President Akufo-Addo directed the Finance Minister in July 2022 to formally engage the International Monetary Fund for an 18th economic programme.

In December 2022, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement on Ghana's $3 bilion debt bailout with board approval in early 2023 as indicated in a press conference by Ofori-Atta.

On 17 May 2023, the IMF Board approved a $3-billion Extended Credit Facility Arrangement for Ghana.

On 10 January 2023, Ofori-Atta was appointed caretaker minister of the Ministry of Trade and Industry following the resignation of Alan John Kyerematen.

On 14 February 2024, he was replaced as finance minister by President Akufo-Addo in a cabinet reshuffle following criticism of his handling of the country's economic woes. He was replaced by Mohammed Amin Adam. In early February 2025, Ken Ofori-Atta was added to the Special Prosecutor’s wanted list over financial misconduct charges. But on February 18, 2025, his name was removed after he pledged to return voluntarily.
