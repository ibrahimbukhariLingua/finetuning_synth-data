Grupo Elektra


# Grupo Elektra



**Grupo Elektra** is a Mexican financial and retail corporation founded in 1950 by Hugo Salinas Price. The company currently operates over seven thousand points of contact across Mexico, United States, and Central America, through two business divisions: commercial and financial. Its parent company, Grupo Salinas, is a corporate group with interests across various economic sectors.

Grupo Elektra's commercial division includes Elektra, Italika, and Salinas y Rocha, while its financial division comprises *Banco Azteca, Seguros Azteca, Punto Casa de Bolsa, Purpose Financial*, and *Afore Azteca**.* Also, Elektra is listed on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores and on the Spanish Stock Market Latibex (XEKT).


## History

The origins of *Grupo Elektra* date back to 1950, when entrepreneur Hugo Salinas Price launched a small appliance store in Monterrey, Nuevo León. Although the company initially specialized in radio equipment, over time it added other products to its catalog, such as furniture, televisions, and home accessories, enabling it to establish new locations across the country.

Initially, *Elektra* served only wholesalers; however, as this model declined, Salinas Price shifted the company's focus to retail and credit sales. In the mid-1980s, he passed the management of the company to his son, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, who assumed the role of president in 1987. After achieving international expansion, the company made its debut on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, in Spanish) in 1993.

That same year, the company acquired the state-owned Mexican broadcaster known as *Imevisión*, which later became *TV Azteca*. Six years later, the company acquired a 94.3 % share in the *Salinas y Rocha* store chain, and in 2002, founded *Banco Azteca*, a financial institution aimed at serving segments of the population underserved by traditional banks.

In 2004, the company launched *Seguros Azteca* and entered the motorcycle market with the introduction of the *Italika* brand. In early 2012, the group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire the non-bank lender *Advance America* (now known as *Purpose Financial*) to expand its operations in the United States. Also in 2012, *Punto Casa de Bolsa*, an investment institution focused on small and medium-sized enterprises, began operations.

On December 27, 2024, Grupo Elektra announced its decision to delist its shares from the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), transitioning into a private company. This decision was approved by over 95% of its shareholders during an extraordinary meeting held on the same day. The company stated that this move was part of a strategy to strengthen its financial, digital, and international capabilities while maximizing its real value.

As part of the delisting process, Grupo Elektra appointed a new Board of Directors, with Pedro Padilla Longoria as Chairman and Gabriel Alfonso Roqueñí Rello as CEO.
