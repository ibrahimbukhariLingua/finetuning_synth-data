# Isidore Finance



**Isidore Finance** (7 February 1848, Sainte-Croix-aux-Mines – 16 October 1918), Paris was a French house painter and decorator and syndicalist.

He was involved with the Cercle des prolétaires positivistes and contributed to *Le Positivisme au Congrès Ouvrier* with Fabien Magnin and Emile Laporte

At the Socialist Workers' Congress (1879) in Marseille Finance, he represented the building painters of Paris and urged "tough-fisted and hardheaded workingmen ... to demand a wage that is not simply the equivalent to the product of their labours, but sufficient to keep women and the aged at home."
