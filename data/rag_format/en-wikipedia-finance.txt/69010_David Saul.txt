## Political career

Having finished his career in business David Saul was elected in 1989 from the United Bermuda Party (UBP) and soon after became a Minister of Finance at the government of John Swan. In 1995 the latter appointed him as his successor at the head of United Bermuda Party and government.

Saul was the fifth premier of Bermuda from 25 August 1995 to 27 March 1997, and his main task was negotiations with the British government of John Major about receiving British citizenship for the inhabitants of Bermuda. However, during Saul's tenure, UBP divided in two parts. One part supported the former Premier John Swan, who wanted to bring the franchise of McDonald's restaurants he owned to Bermuda. Unable to bring back party unity, Saul had to resign in 1997 and returned to running his businesses.
