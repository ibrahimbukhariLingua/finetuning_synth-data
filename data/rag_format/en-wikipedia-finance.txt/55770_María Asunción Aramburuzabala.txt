## Early life

María Asunción Aramburuzabala Larregui was born on 2 May 1963 in Mexico City, Mexico to Pablo Aramburuzabala Ocaranza, a Spanish Basque brewer in Mexico, and Lucrecia Larregui González, a Mexican painter whose father, José Larregui Iriarte, was a Navarrese miller in Mexico. She is the granddaughter of Félix Aramburuzabala Lazcano-Iturburu [es], a Spanish Basque immigrant who co-founded the Mexican brewery Grupo Modelo in 1925 with his friend and partner Pablo Díez Fernández. Her father was the Executive Vice President of the Grupo Modelo brewery.

Aramburuzabala graduated from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México where she majored in accounting.


## Family business

The Mexican brewery, Cervecería Modelo, was founded in 1925 by a group of businessmen, including don Pablo Díez Fernández — who became the company's President, CEO and major stockholder — and Felix Aramburuzabala. Felix's son, Pablo Aramburuzabala, the executive vice president of the brewery, died unexpectedly in 1995 of lung cancer at the age of 63. After his death, several groups tried to gain control of his family's share in Modelo — his wife and two daughters bonded together against these groups.

The family created Tresalia Capital ("tres aliadas" or three allies) in order to diversify the family investments. Through Tresalia, they have made investments in large Mexican companies, as well as the management of private equity, real estate, infrastructure, venture capital, technology and the creation of new companies.

After Grupo Modelo's sale, she reinvested her proceeds into Anheuser-Busch InBev, continuing the family tradition in the beer business.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
