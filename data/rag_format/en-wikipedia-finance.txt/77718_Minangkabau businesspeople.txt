## History

For centuries, the Minangkabau trade in mining and agriculture products has been a major source of the dynamic progress of the Indian Ocean economy.


### 7th–18th century

Minangkabau traders have been trading since the 7th century. They became influential traders operating on the west and east coast of Sumatra. The gold trade was originally the main trade of the Minangkabau people. The Tanah Datar Valley was an important place as gold producer for the Minangkabau economy.⁶⁹ The pursuit of gold sometimes encourages migration of Minang people. The arrival of the Minangkabau people in the northwest of Jambi, was caused by the search for gold.⁷⁹ Invited by King Regale and his predecessors, many Minang people crossed the Malacca strait to Johor to collect gold chunks. The Minangkabau gold traders were often the leading mining entrepreneurs, who relied on the Tanah Datar political system to protect them as they led their caravan of one hundred or more men on foot down the rugged slopes of Bukit Barisan to the harbor in the west coast. By the late 18th century, gold mines were running out and their fortunes had reached a nadir.

After gold reserves declined, trade of agriculture commodities became the main business of the Minang people. The pepper, acacia and gambier trade flourished in the 15th-18th century, as well as the coffee trade in the 18th to 19th century. The commodities brought from the Minangkabau Highlands to the Malacca strait or the Indian Ocean to be sold to foreign traders. Most of trade to the east coast was carried out via major rivers such as the Kampar, Siak, Indragiri and Batang Hari. Because of the trading activity, many Minang traders migrated and established colonies along the west and east coast of Sumatra, even to the Malay peninsula. On the west coast, they established trading posts in Meulaboh, Barus, Natal, Pariaman, Padang up to Bengkulu. In the east coast, Minang traders colonies stretched from Batubara, Pelalawan, Siak up to Jambi.

Since the emergence of Srivijaya Kingdom and continued to Malacca Sultanate, many Minangkabau traders worked for the kings. The role of Minangkabau traders began to decline since the Dutch control of the west coast of Sumatra. The establishment of Penang and Singapore in the Malacca strait, revived trade between Minangkabau and the outside world. Consequently, many villages in the Minangkabau highland immediately became prosperous. Besides being intermediary traders, many Minang merchants as cross-strait traders. These traders transport various commodities that came from the interior of Sumatra to be sold to foreign ships in the Straits Settlements. In addition to trading in the Malacca strait, the cross-strait businessmen also operate in the west coast of Sumatra, the Karimata Islands, the Sunda Strait, the Java Sea, the Sulu Sea up to the Maluku Islands. Besides three brothers: Nakhoda Bayan, Nakhoda Intan, and Nakhoda Kecil; Nakhoda Mangkuto, who was later succeeded by his son Nakhoda Muda, were some of the successful cross-strait traders.

In the second half 18th century, new crops and industries flourished in Minangkabau. Cotton cultivation was progress rapidly and provides material for cotton weaving in Agam. Gambier tree was planted and used as medicine, which later became an export commodity in Limapuluh Kota. Furthermore in the west coast, growing salt ponds.¹⁰⁶ It was stimulate some of entrepreneurs to achieve more wealth, and then laid the path for the development of the Padri movement, a religious reform movement pioneered by Tuanku Nan Tuo and Tuanku Nan Renceh.


### 19th–20th century

At the beginning 19th century, European traders especially the Dutch, began to dominate the Minangkabau economy. The Padri War which lasted for more than 30 years, tried to expel the Dutch merchants who tried to monopolize all Minangkabau trade goods. The defeat of the Padri troops destroyed the Minangkabau economy, and the Minangkabau world under the rule of the Dutch East Indies. Despite being under colonial control, the Minang realm also gave birth to several influential businessmen, including Abdul Gani Rajo Mangkuto and Muhammad Saleh. In 1914, several Minang traders, headed by Taher Marah Soetan, founded the Sarikat Usaha. In addition to strengthening Minang business, this union also aims to promote education and the struggle for independence. In 1930s, two prominent Minangs enterprises : Bank Nasional and Djohan Djohor were established in Bukittinggi and Jakarta respectively. At that time, Djohan Djohor was one of the leading textile importer who managed by three Minang entrepreneurs, namely Ayub Rais and the brothers Djohan Sutan Sulaiman and Djohor Sutan Perpatih.

The revival of Minang traders occurred again after Indonesian independence. Between 1950 and 1965, many Minangkabaus business standing strengthened after being limited to small businesses in the colonial period. Hasyim Ning, Rahman Tamin, Sidi Tando and Rukmini Zainal Abidin were the top conglomerates in Indonesia during the liberal democracy period. At that time, Minangkabau was among the most wealthy groups in Indonesia.¹⁰⁷ In the New Order era, the government's policy in favor of Chinese traders was detrimental to Minangkabau traders. Chinese capitalists, called the *cukong*, were supported by the military, which emerged as the dominant political force after 1965.²⁷² At that time, the Minang merchants were experiencing difficult in bank loans and obtaining business permits. On the other hand, in Malaysia they actually get convenience because of government policies that prioritize indigenous traders. As a result, many Minang entrepreneurs have succeeded in Malaysia, such as Nasimuddin Amin, Kamarudin Meranun, and also the royal family of Negeri Sembilan who owned some of companies. At the end of 1990s, several Minang businessmen led by Abdul Latief, Aminuzal Amin, Nasroel Chas, and Fahmi Idris established a joint venture company Nagari Development Corporation (NDC), which aims to improve the Minangkabau community.
