Perodua


# Perodua



***Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sendirian Berhad*** (Eng. transl.: "second automobile enterprise private limited"), usually abbreviated to **Perodua** (Malay: [pəroˈdua]), is Malaysia's largest car manufacturer, followed by Proton Holdings.


## Background and history

Perodua was established in 1993 and launched its first 5-door hatchback, the Perodua Kancil, in August 1994. Initially, the company mainly produced minicars and superminis and did not have models in the same market segments as Proton. Its targeted market segments later began to overlap with Proton's—especially in the super-compact segment, where the Perodua Myvi has competed with the likes of the Proton Savvy and the Proton Iriz.

Perodua does not design or engineer its main components, such as engines and transmissions, in-house; its cars have historically used Daihatsu component designs. Daihatsu held a 20% stake in Perodua at the company's launch, increasing it to 25% in 2001 and then to 35%. In 2004, Perodua began assembling the Toyota Avanza at its plant in Rawang, for sale in Malaysia.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The company's shareholders include UMW Holdings (38%), Daihatsu Motor Co. (20%), Daihatsu (Malaysia) (5%), MBM Resources (20%), PNB Equity Resource Corporation (10%), Mitsui & Co. (4.2%), and Mitsui & Co. (Asia Pacific) (2.8%).


## Sales

**Domestic**
Perodua sold more than 207,100 vehicles in 2016, which was its highest yearly sales record to date, and achieved a highest-ever domestic market share of 35.7%.

**International**
In the United Kingdom, Perodua's cars were sold by some Proton dealers, who wished to attract customers seeking a smaller and cheaper alternative to the Proton range.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Sales numbers in the UK were small, however, and in 2008, Perodua sold only 624 cars (down from 914 in 2002). Sales were up slightly in 2009 (to 650) and then to 761 in 2010, mainly due to the new Perodua Myvi selling comparatively well.

Currently, Perodua cars are exported to Singapore, Brunei, Mauritius, Fiji, Sri Lanka, and Seychelles. The company also exported the Myvi as the Daihatsu Sirion to Indonesia, which made up 55 percent of their exports in 2020.

In 2021, the company began exploring the idea of exporting used Perodua cars overseas. As of 2024, the company was exporting used cars to a few countries, including Fiji. At the same time, exports of used cars were halted in Sri Lanka.

## Brand identity


### Logo history

Perodua organised a competition in 1997 to find a new corporate logo, to be launched together with their upcoming model, tentatively known as the X555. The competition was won by Johnson Ng Weng Kuan, an architecture student from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Perodua officially unveiled the new corporate logo on 24 August 1998, when they launched Malaysia's first sport utility vehicle, the Perodua Kembara.

The new logo maintains the 'P' and '2' and the colours of the old, squarish logo, but has been stylised further to become elliptical.
