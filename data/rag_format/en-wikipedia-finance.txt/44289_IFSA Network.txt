IFSA Network


# IFSA Network



The **IFSA Network** formerly known as the **International Finance Students Association Network**, is a global non-profit network of finance student associations to help student members develop the skills and contacts to be active in the financial market. It is exclusively run by students. It was initially based at the Rotterdam School of Management.

The network operates under a decentralized yet cohesive organizational structure and is split into regional chapters.


## History

The International Finance Student Association traces its roots back to 2014 in Rotterdam, specifically at the Rotterdam School of Management. The initial purpose of the network was to create a community for individuals studying Finance, fostering connections both amongst themselves and with established figures in the financial sector.

A new structure was brought in from the 2024-25 tenure to better deal with the delegation of responsibilities as the network continued to expand. The leadership team now consists of a three-member board - the Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and Treasurer - and a five-member Executive Committee, comprising the respective heads of APAC, EMEA and LATAM, Head of Communications and Head of Operations.


## Structure


### Chapters

The IFSA Network operates under a decentralized yet cohesive organizational structure designed to balance local autonomy with global coordination. Situated in educational institutions across the world, the individual chapters serve as semi-independent units, each governed by their own board comprising at least a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasurer, and General Secretary. These boards manage day-to-day operations and supervise regional activities tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of their local student bodies. Chapters also usually have specialized departments, such as Finance, Marketing, and Events, each headed by a department manager who oversees a team of analysts.
