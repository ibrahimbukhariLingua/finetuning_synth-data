## History

eSky Group was founded in Poland in 2004 and initially handled trips as part of the Work and Travel program. Since 2005, the company has been selling airline tickets through its online platform, with approximately 550 airlines included in its flight inventory under agreements. In 2009, an online hotel reservation system and travel insurance sales were launched, and in 2015, a car rental service.

In June 2017, 6.3% of eSky Group shares were bought for PLN 15.6 million by Wirtualna Polska Group, which in March 2020 sold its eSky share package under the put option.

In 2022, the company’s owner changed, with MCI Capital listed private equity took a 55% stake in eSky Group.

The founders of eSky Group remained the controlling shareholders, holding a total of 45% of the company's shares, and the transaction amounted to approximately PLN 158 million and also included the recapitalization of the company.

In 2023, due to a business transformation towards a package travel provider, the Polish OTA switched its focus from flights aggregation to combining flights and accommodations into city breaks and holidays packages. The same year, the company reported revenue of more than €800m – an increase of 42% year-on-year – with around 3.3m customers using its services. eSky Group's EBITDA amounted to €18.7m.

In April 2024, eSky Group established a partnership with Ryanair, Europe's low-cost carrier, becoming one of the first authorised online travel agencies to provide Ryanair flights, seats, and baggage. The deal guaranteed passengers that their contact and payment information is provided from the travel agent directly to the airline.

At the same time, the travel platform started offering package holidays and city breaks in the United Kingdom. This followed the passing the UK's Civil Aviation Authority approval, and the company covered its packages with the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) protection scheme (no. 12520).

In September 2024, eSky Group acquired Thomas Cook from Hong Kong’s Fosun Tourism Group, excluding its operations in China and India. The company expanded from an online flight aggregator to a provider of package holidays and city breaks in over 50 countries.
