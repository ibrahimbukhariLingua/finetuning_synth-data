List of Japanese coinage patterns


# List of Japanese coinage patterns



The following is a list of Japanese pattern coins from the yen based currency system started under the Meiji Restoration. The first patterns of the yen based system were made from 1869 to 1870 as presentation pieces to the Emperor. The new currency system was eventually adopted by the Meiji government in an Act signed on June 27, 1871. Pattern coins are almost never released into circulation as they are made for evaluation purposes only. Once a pattern is approved by government officials, it then goes to the minting process. Most of the patterns listed below are very rare, and sell for considerable amounts at auctions. The market value and rarity of any given coin is dependent on supply and demand.


## Selected terminology

The following terms appear on the list below:

**Legend(s)** – In numismatic terminology "legends" refer to inscriptions on any given coin. Common inscriptions for these coins include; "Great Japan" (大日本), the reigning Emperor's name (ex: 明治 Meiji), the value of the coin, and the year of the Emperor's reign.

**Obverse/Reverse** – These refer to the front (o) and back (r) side of a coin.

**Struck/Strike** – This is part of the minting process.

**Variety** – Coins struck with minor changes to their initial design are called "varieties".
