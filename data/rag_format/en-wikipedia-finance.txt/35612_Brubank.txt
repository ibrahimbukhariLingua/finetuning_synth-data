## History

Brubank was founded in 2017. Juan Bruchou, CEO of Citibank Argentina, had proposed an entirely digital bank, without branch offices. Brubank obtained license by the Central Bank of Argentina to operate in September 2018. After a first "friends and family" trial, Brubank launched its app on Apple and Android stores. In August 2019, Canadian billionaire David Thomson bought a 15 percent stake in Brubank.
