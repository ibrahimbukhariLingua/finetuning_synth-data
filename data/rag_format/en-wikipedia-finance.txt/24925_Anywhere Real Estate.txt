## History

In 2005, Cendant split off all but its car rental interests into separate companies. Realogy was formed to group its real estate activities; shares in the new company were distributed to existing Cendant shareholders. In late 2006, it was bought for $6.65 billion, plus debt and other liabilities, by Apollo Global Management, a private equity group.

The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012; 40 million shares were sold at $27 each, raising US$1.08 billion.

In 2013, the company moved its head office from Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey to Madison, New Jersey. Ryan Schneider succeeded Richard A. Smith as chief executive officer in 2017.

In May 2022, Realogy announced that the company would be changing its name from Realogy Holdings Corp. to Anywhere Real Estate Inc. This went into effect on 9 June 2022.
