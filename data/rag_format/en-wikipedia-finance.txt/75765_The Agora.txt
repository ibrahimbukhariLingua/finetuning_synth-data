## Litigation against Agora Inc.

In *Ginsburg v. Agora, Inc.*, 915 F. Supp. 733 (1995), Agora defended itself against a civil suit claiming violations of state and federal securities laws. The court dismissed the complaint, holding that Agora, as the publisher of a subscription investment newsletter, was protected by the First Amendment against liability for factual misstatements.

In *Lubin v. Agora, Inc.*, 882 A.2d 833 (2005), pursuant to an investigation into potential violations of Maryland securities laws, the Maryland Securities Commissioner served two subpoenas duces tecum on Agora. Following Agora’s refusal to produce its subscriber lists, marketing lists, and other documents containing information identifying any of its subscribers, the Commissioner filed a motion to compel enforcement. The trial court ruled in favor of Agora and denied the motion, concluding that the Commissioner had failed to demonstrate a compelling need for the subscriber lists as required by the First Amendment, and that the demand for subscriber lists was overbroad. The Maryland Securities Commissioner appealed this decision, but the appeals court ruled in favor of Agora. In its opinion, the appeals court unanimously ruled the First Amendment prevents the Commissioner from compelling the discovery of the identities of Agora’s subscribers.

In "SEC v. Agora, Inc., Pirate Investor, and Frank Porter Stansberry", (SEC v. Agora complaint, 2003), the SEC alleged Agora companies wrongly profited from selling false information marketed as insider tips. In US SEC v. Pirate Investor LLC, 580 F.3d 233, 255 (4th Cir. 2009) the US Court of Appeal, against the arguments from publishing industry interveners, found fraud by the Agora company, and confirmed that punishing fraud, whether common law fraud or securities fraud, does not violate the First Amendment.

Despite being in business for over 17 years, Agora's child company, Agora Financial, currently has its rating suspended by the Better Business Bureau. The company is no longer a BBB accredited company, due to a high volume of complaints. The complaints range from poor communication by Customer Service Representatives, to false advertising/misrepresentation and generally include statements that the company has 'stolen' funds from subscribers. Agora Financial stated that the number of complaints seemed so high due to a recent growth in their company. As of 2019, there are over 300 complaints on the company's BBB page.


## Philanthropy

In 2002, Agora created the non-profit Roberto Clemente Santa Ana Health Clinic to provide low cost and free medical care to the community of Limon 1 in southwest Nicaragua. The clinic serves about 12,000 patients each year.
