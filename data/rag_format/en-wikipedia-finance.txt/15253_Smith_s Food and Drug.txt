Smith's Food and Drug


# Smith's Food and Drug



**Smith's Food and Drug**, or simply **Smith's**, is an American regional supermarket chain that was founded by Lorenzo Smith in 1911 in Brigham City, Utah. Headquartered in Salt Lake City with stores in Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, Smith's became a subsidiary of Kroger in 1998.


## History


### Beginning

Smith's Food & Drug began in 1911 when Lorenzo Smith opened a small dry goods store in Brigham City, Utah. It was replaced with a larger store across the street in 1922 and renamed "Smith & Son's Market" in 1932. When his son Dee Glen Smith joined the business after serving in World War II, he began immediately expanding it.

The company's growth ramped up exponentially from 1946 to 1958. It changed its name to Smith's Super Market in 1952. When Dee Smith took over as president upon his father's death in 1958, he determined Brigham City was saturated, and felt the only option was to expand to other markets. Through partnerships and acquisitions, Dee Smith built the company until his death at age 58 in 1984. After his death, his eldest son Fred Smith, ran the chain until later, when his brother Jeff Smith became the chairman and CEO of Smith's.

In 1989, the company completed its initial public offering and shares of the company started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1996, Smith's acquired the Arizona supermarket chain Smitty's Supermarkets.


## Acquisitions


### Fred Meyer

In 1997, Smith's Food & Drug was acquired by Portland-based Fred Meyer for about $700 million (equivalent to $1.33 billion in 2023) in stock. The deal created a supermarket and general merchandise chain with 374 stores in 17 western states.

Under the terms of the agreement, Smith's shareholders received 1.05 shares of Fred Meyer common stock for each share of Smith's common stock, or about $45 a share. Fred Meyer also assumed $1.3 billion (equivalent to $2.47 billion in 2023) in Smith's debt, which was accumulated largely from a recapitalization that was led by the Yucaipa Companies of Los Angeles.


### Kroger

In 1998, Fred Meyer was acquired by Kroger in a deal that created a supermarket giant with $43 billion ($78.6 billion in 2023) in annual revenue and 2,200 stores in 31 states. As a result of the Kroger–Fred Meyer merger, Smith's had immediately become a subsidiary of Kroger and most Smith's Food & Drug Centers in Arizona were rebranded as Fry's Food and Drug. Kroger paid about $8 billion (equivalent to $14.63 billion in 2023) in stock for Fred Meyer and assumed $4.8 billion (equivalent to $8.78 billion in 2023) of the company's debt, further consolidating the grocery business and creating the largest supermarket chain in the country.

With the transaction, Kroger regained the spot it lost to Albertsons as the nation's largest supplier of eggs and milk. The acquisition gave Kroger the status of the nation's largest supermarket company, stretching from the fast-growing Western markets, where Portland-based Fred Meyer is strong, to the Midwest and the Southeast, where the Cincinnati-based company has many stores and much visibility. The move gave Kroger even greater purchasing power and substantial economies of scale. Many of the products sold at Smith's are Kroger-branded.


## Smith's Marketplace

In 2004, Kroger introduced a new store concept known as Marketplaces which served as medium-sized department stores and sold clothing, household goods and often contained bank branches and a Fred Meyer Jewelers in addition to food and pharmacy sales. In April 2004, Kroger merged Fred Meyer's Utah operations into Smith's. Five Utah Fred Meyer stores were converted to the new Smith's Marketplace banner in June of that year. The other Utah Fred Meyer stores located in Ogden, West Valley City, and Sandy were closed. Earlier, Fred Meyer had closed a full-service store located in Orem that failed to meet expectations.

On November 12, 2008, a new Smith's Marketplace store was opened in Lehi, Utah. The store is 170,000 square feet (16,000 m²). In 2008, Smith's also remodeled the former Fred Meyer store located at 500 East and 500 South in Salt Lake City. That store in Downtown Salt Lake is the biggest location. On July 16, 2014, Smith's opened a new Smith's Marketplace in Los Alamos, New Mexico. In November 2014, Smith's opened up its seventh marketplace store in North Ogden, Utah. On December 3, 2014, Smith's opened up its eighth store in West Jordan, Utah, located off 7800 South and the Mountain View Corridor. Smith's opened its ninth Marketplace store in Kaysville, Utah in late 2015. Another Marketplace was opened in South Jordan, Utah late 2016, as well as another in Springville, Utah in April 2017.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On June 13, 2018, Smith's opened its first Marketplace in northwest Las Vegas.
