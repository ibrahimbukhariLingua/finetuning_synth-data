The company emerged in the backdrop of partisan political bickering in the US state of Ohio in 2010–2011. A group of state representatives allied with Service Employees International Union District 1199, a branch of a major trade union, pointed out that Mark Kvamme, a political appointee put in charge of creating jobs in Ohio, was a partner in Sequoia Capital, which had invested in VanceInfo. The state representatives and union branded Kvamme as unfit for the role of creating jobs in the state since he was tied to VanceInfo, an outsourcing company, through his stake in Sequoia Capital
