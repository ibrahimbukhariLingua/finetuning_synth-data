The artwork of about 6 ft wide and long, consists of the face of Donald Trump with a handwriting message forming a spiral in "Mexican pink" acrylic, reminiscent of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo scriptures on top of several paintings. The text invites anyone to change towards a more humane lifestyle and predicts an inevitable change of social and economic paradigms.

## Theme

***Teoría de Precios: Porqué está mal la Economía*** questions the fundamentals of economic theory. According to Del Villar, while all the components of the market have changed, including economic goods, producers and consumers, the basic theoretical principles have remained the same since 1776 when Adam Smith published An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Del Villar believes that economic theory, including the Law of Demand, the Law of Supply, and the explanations given to price determination, lacks of scientific rigor. He also considers that the discipline does not provide veridical explanations to the way consumers and producers behave in the real world.

Del Villar proposes an integral revision of the fundamental principles upon which economic theory is built and suggests that other disciplines, like anthropology, should be included in such a process.
