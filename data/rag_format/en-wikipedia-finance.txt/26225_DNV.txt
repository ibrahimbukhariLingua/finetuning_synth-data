**Det Norske Veritas** (**DNV**), formerly **DNV GL**, is an international accredited registrar and classification society headquartered in Høvik, Norway. DNV provides services for several industries, including maritime, oil and gas, renewable energy, electrification, and healthcare.

As of 10 January 2024, the company has about 15,000 employees and 350 offices operating in more than 100 countries and provides services for several industries. In 2013, Det Norske Veritas (Norway) and Germanischer Lloyd (Germany), two prominent organizations in the industry, merged to form DNV GL. The company later simplified its name to DNV in 2021, while maintaining the organizational structure that resulted from the merger.

DNV provides services for 13,175 vessels and mobile offshore units (MOUs), amounting to 265.4 million gross tonnes, which represents a global market share of 21%. 65% of the world's offshore pipelines are designed and installed to DNV's technical standards.

Prior to the merger, both DNV and GL had independently acquired several companies in different sectors, such as Hélimax Energy (Canada), Garrad Hassan (UK), Windtest (Germany) and KEMA (Netherlands). DNV also invests in research.

Remi Eriksen has been the Group President and CEO of DNV since August 1, 2015, succeeding Henrik O. Madsen.


## Summary

DNV's history dates from 1864, when Det Norske Veritas was established in Norway to head the technical inspection and evaluation of Norwegian merchant vessels. Germanischer Lloyd was founded in Hamburg in 1867 by a group of 600 ship owners, ship builders and insurers. The company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014.

On 20 December 2012, the two companies announced the merger, which was approved by competition authorities in South Korea, the US, the EU, and China, thus allowing the merger contract between DNV and GL to be signed on 12 September 2013. The independent Det Norske Veritas Foundation owned 63.5% of DNV GL shares and 36.5% of Mayfair Vermögensverwaltung until December 2017, when Mayfair sold its shares to the Det Norske Veritas Foundation. DNV GL changed its name to DNV on 1 March 2021.

In September 2023, it was announced that DNV had acquired the US-headquartered SaaS company, ANB Systems. The company provides energy programme services to utility and regulatory body customers.
