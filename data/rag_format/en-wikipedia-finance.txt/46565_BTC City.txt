# BTC City



**BTC City** (Slovene: *Družba BTC*) is a shopping mall, sports, entertainment and business area in Ljubljana, Slovenia, with more than 500 shops. It is one of the largest shopping and entertainment complexes in Europe.


## History

In 1954, a company named Centralna skladišča (Central Warehouses) was founded with a founding contract. Central Warehouses expanded their operations by starting to carry out the warehousing activities also for other companies, which were not among the co-founders of the company. Due to the expansion of the activity and the extent of operations, the company changed its name to Javna skladišča (Public Warehouses). In 1975, the company became the largest goods and transport centre in former Yugoslavia. In the same year, Javna skladišča changed its name to Blagovno Transportni Center Ljubljana (Ljubljana Goods and Transport Centre, BTC). 1990 presented a turning point for BTC. In search and confirmation of the entrepreneurial freedom, the company decided to change its name to Blagovno Trgovinski Center (Goods and Shopping Centre) and the company, which, up to that point, managed warehousing space, transformed itself into a public limited company in 1990, becoming responsible for the selection of new, profitable, compatible and competitive programmes and business contents, and suitable infrastructure as well. First individual stores started opening. In 1993, when the management of the company was taken over by Jože Mermal, the empty warehousing facilities began to acquire a new, more attractive image, and the first shops formed in the renovated Hall A. In 1994, the company stocks were quoted on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange. In 1997, the public limited company BTC became an international capital company, as its shares were the listed at the London Stock Exchange as shares of the first Slovenian company. Soon afterwards, the Frankfurt and Munich Stock Exchanges followed.
