## The Chartwell Foundation and Corporate giving

In 2020, The Chartwell Foundation (Charity #714784931 RR 0001) was established as a national charity to carry on helping seniors continue to live a life of purpose, connectedness, and engagement through wish granting. The Chartwell Foundation is on a mission to grant the wishes of all Canadian seniors and to contribute to meaningful charities with a shared purpose of making people’s lives better.

In 2015, Chartwell assisted in the creation and became the main sponsor of Wish of a Lifetime Canada, a charitable organization focused on granting wishes to seniors in Canada. Chartwell also continues to grant resident wishes through its Moments that Matter program, part of their recreation team’s activity programming in their retirement homes. Wish of a Lifetime Canada ceased its operations in 2020.

In 2010, Chartwell created and published a book entitled *Honour* to commemorate Canada’s Second World War veterans.


## COVID-19 response

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020–2021, Chartwell was in the "spotlight" as an operator of for-profit care, which had disproportionately high COVID-19 resident deaths compared to not-for-profit or municipal retirement residences in Ontario. It also sparked controversy by paying its shareholders and board members tens of millions in dividends while at the same time receiving tens of millions in emergency funding from the Province of Ontario. The announcement that former Ontario Premier and former Chartwell chairman of the board Mike Harris would be receiving the Order of Ontario consequently sparked controversy.
