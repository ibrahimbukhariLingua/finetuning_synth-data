# International Trade Centre



The **International Trade Centre** (**ITC**) (French: *Centre du commerce international (CCI)*) is a multilateral agency which has a joint mandate with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations (UN) through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

The headquarters of the ITC are in Geneva, and the agency employs around 300 employees from over 80 different nationalities.


## History

ITC is the successor to the International Trade Information Centre, which the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established in 1964 to assist the exports of developing countries. An agreement was reached between the GATT and the newly established UNCTAD to create a joint subsidiary in 1967. The International Trade Centre (ITC) was established on 1 January 1968. The ITC has a joint mandate with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations (UN) through the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The ITC is the focal point for trade-related technical assistance.


## Funding

The work of the ITC is financed by contributions from the private sector and resources provided by beneficiary countries and international organizations.
