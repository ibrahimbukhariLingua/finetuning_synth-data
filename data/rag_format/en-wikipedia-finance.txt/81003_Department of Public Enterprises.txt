Department of Public Enterprises


# Department of Public Enterprises



The **Department of Public Enterprises** (**DPE**) was one of the ministries of the South African government. It was the government's shareholder representative with oversight responsibility for a number of state-owned enterprises (SoEs). The department was shut down after the 2024 elections and folded into the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) during the process of implementing a new shareholder model.

It is estimated that South Africa has about 300 SoEs, nine of which fall under the responsibility of the DPE;

* Alexkor – Mining sector (diamond mining)
* Denel – Aerospace and Defence sector (armaments manufacturer)
* Eskom – Energy sector (national electricity utility)
* South African Express – Transport sector (regional and feeder airline)
* South African Forestry Company – Forestry sector (manages forestry on state owned-land)
* Transnet – Transport and related infrastructure sector (railways, harbours, oil/fuel pipelines and terminals)
