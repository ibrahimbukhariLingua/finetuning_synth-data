### CPPIB Resignation

On 26 February 2021, Machin tendered his resignation to the board of CPPIB, following reports that he had traveled to the UAE to receive a Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with his partner. In an internal memo sent to staff, Machin said that while he had completed all the proper procedures for the trip, it was meant to be "very private" and he regretted the negative connections brought to the CPPIB.

The office of Chrystia Freeland, Canada's finance minister, criticized Machin's decision while recognizing its independence from governments.

Machin was succeeded by John Graham, CPPIB’s global head of credit investments.

On 4 March 2021, The Globe and Mail reported that Machin was likely to resign from his position sometime later in 2021 after more than 5 years in the role, and that he had already tapped John Graham to be his successor before the resignation, when the transition timeline was accelerated.
