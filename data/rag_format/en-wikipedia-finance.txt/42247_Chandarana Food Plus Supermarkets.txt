# Chandarana Food Plus Supermarkets



**Chandarana Food Plus Supermarkets**, is a Kenyan supermarket chain operated by **Chandarana Food Plus Supermarkets Limited**. The Head Office is in Nairobi.


## Overview

The supermarket chain started in 1964, as a single grocery store, operated by the patriarch of the family, the late entrepreneur **Shantilal Mulji Thakkar**, with twelve employees. Over the years the business has expanded to 20 stores in major urban centers in Kenya. Three of the founder's sons, *Anil Thakkar*, *Sanjay Thakkar* and *Dipan Thakkar*, run the enterprise.

The company's former group chief operating officer, is *Hanif Rajan*, a native of Eldoret, Kenya, with a varied retail career in Kenya, Canada, Seychelles and Tanzania. In an interview with Business Daily Africa, in February 2018, Rajan said that the chain owes its success to a cautious, conservative expansion policy, that has saved it from making irrational, emotional decisions. One of the areas that the chain pays special attention to are its suppliers, who deal directly with management, without any middlemen.

The supermarket has remained focused on food items, including in-house butcheries, bakeries, wine and spirits sections, fresh vegetables and sandwich shops. They have stayed away from big ticket manufactured items, such as radios, televisions, refrigerators and cookers. Also, the chain does not maintain warehouses; the suppliers deliver merchandise/produce directly to the store that they supply.

## Controversy

The management of Chandarana supermarkets apologized adding that this was not in line with the supermarket's values.


## Developments
