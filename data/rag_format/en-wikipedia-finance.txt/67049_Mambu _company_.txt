## History

Mambu was founded in 2011 by Frederik Pfisterer and Eugene Danilkis, who had developed technical infrastructure for microfinanciers in Latin America and Africa. The company's first clients were mainly from emerging markets. Early backers included Commerzbank and Berlin-based venture capitalist Point Nine.

In 2016, the German neobank N26 became a Mambu customer. Solarisbank also relies on Mambu's software.

In June 2021, Mambu raised nearly â‚¬200 million in a financing round led by EQT AB.

According to Handelsblatt, contracted annual recurring revenue is estimated at $165 million for 2022.

In 2020, Mambu first partnered with C24 Bank to launch the greenfield digital retail bank. In June 2023, Mambu and C24 Bank announced an extension to their ongoing partnership.
