## Overview

As part of a customer experience management (CX or employee engagement) program, Medallia's cloud-based customer experience (CX) software platform captures voice of the customer feedback across Web, social, mobile, and contact center channels, analyzes it in real-time, and provides action workflows to executive, central and front-line teams for customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, Net Promoter scores and overall business performance.

Medallia provides a platform for social, text, video, speech, messaging and online feedback. The software analyzes feedback from Facebook, Twitter, and other major review sites (e.g., TripAdvisor) alongside solicited feedback data from surveys and contact centers. In addition to social media feedback and analysis, as well as mobile feedback and engagement, capabilities of the company's product include survey creation and management, text analytics and dashboarding, and direct goals and action management.
