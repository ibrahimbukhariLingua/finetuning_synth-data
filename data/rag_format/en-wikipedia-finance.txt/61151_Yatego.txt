While entering a search term the Yatego System shows suggestions of completed terms in a drop-down menu, also displaying the quantity of articles listed for the search term. A correction tool promotes an effective search in which the system recognizes that a more common search term creates more results (for example by correcting the spelling).
Yatego also offers an advanced search option where the description of the article is also being scanned.

Yatego may be searched by brand, top sellers, bargain-priced goods, themes, traders/shops, branches, and coupons.

All goods on Yatego are published in categories divided into a maximum of three levels (Main category - mid-level category - subcategory).
