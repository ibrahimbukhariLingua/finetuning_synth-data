Gerald Loeb Award winners for Magazines


# Gerald Loeb Award winners for Magazines



The Gerald Loeb Award is given annually for multiple categories of business reporting. The "Magazine" category is one of the two original categories awarded in 1958 (the other being "Newspaper"), with the last award given in 2014. The category included articles published the prior year in national and regional periodicals until 2008, when it was expanded to include magazine supplements to newspapers. Previously, newspaper magazine supplements were entered into an appropriate newspaper category. The "Magazine" and "Large Newspaper" categories were replaced by the "Feature" category in 2015.
