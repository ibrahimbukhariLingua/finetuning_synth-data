In 1906, after being passed to Pietro Barbaro, grandson of Marcello, the company changed its name to "Barbaro Capitano Pietro & Figli", later shortened to the current "Pietro Barbaro".

In 1970 the brothers Alfredo and Giovanni Barbaro, great-grandchildren of Pietro, transformed the company into a joint-stock company, which manages of a group of businesses working in ship transport, inland navigation, and in the tourism sector.

In the '80s the group began transporting chemical and petroleum products through its partnership with the Fagioli Group, from which Finaval was born, and with the Marnavi Group, from which Novamar was founded. It also began transporting dry goods with the group CoeClerici from which Somocar and Bulkitalia were founded.
