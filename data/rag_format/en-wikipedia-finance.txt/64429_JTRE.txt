The first project was Mestské vily Machnáč, a residential development on the Bratislava Castle hill in Slovakia. The first office development was the reconstruction of Westend Tower in the Patrónka neighborhood of Bratislava, Slovakia.

Over time, JTRE acquired numerous high-profile land lots in Bratislava and Prague and the company graduated into developing whole city neighborhoods, such as the new downtown of Bratislava branded as Eurovea City. In 2006 the company changed its name to the current J&T Real Estate and two years later JTRE Holding was established dividing from J&T Finance Group.
