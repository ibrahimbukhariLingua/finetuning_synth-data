HAN University of Applied Sciences


# HAN University of Applied Sciences



The **HAN University of Applied Sciences**, mostly referred to as **HAN**, is one of the largest universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. It offers bachelor's and master's degree programs to over 36,000 students. HAN is a knowledge institute for higher education and research in the Dutch province of Gelderland, with campuses in Arnhem and Nijmegen and a research center in Doetinchem.


## History

In the 1980s there were many small universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. The government at the time believed this was inefficient, both in terms of the financing and organizing of education. In 1983 the government pushed smaller universities of applied sciences to merge. The Netherlands Association of Universities of Applied Sciences agreed, and gradually more and more universities of applied sciences in Arnhem and Nijmegen merged.

On 1 February 1996, the HAN conglomerate was finally established and it became a large, broad-based educational institution. Since then the number of students has grown while costs have been reduced, entirely in line with the goals of the government and the Association of Universities of Applied Sciences.

In June 2019, HAN changed its name. Formerly known under its Dutch name Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen, it now bears the name HAN University of Applied Sciences. In the process, HAN also changed its logo and corporate identity.

## Organization

Thera are 14 HAN schools:

* HAN International School of Business
* School of Built Environment
* School of Education

### Management layers

The organization has three management layers:

* The university of applied sciences under management of the Executive Board
* The schools under management of the Executive Board / the Services Department under the management of a director
* The degree programs under management of the schools / the Service Units under management of a head

### Participation

HAN has a structurer in place for staff and student participation and representation in decision-making. This involves:

* A central participation council. This council is a member of the Intercity Student Consultation and the Dutch Association of Participation Councils for Universities of Applied Sciences.
* Fourteen school councils and one Services Department council. These councils also receive support from the Student Consultation on Participation.
* Degree committees for each of the degree programs. The degree committee deals with the operational policy of a degree program and supports the program manager in this.
* The class representatives form the basis for the participation structure.

In 2010-2011, HAN decided not to split the participation council up into a separate student council and a works council, and so instead of following the Works Councils Act they adhere to the Higher Education and Research Act (Wet op Hoger en Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs). At the same time, however, it was decided that each employee participation body may determine its own rules of procedure about whether the student and employee sections within that council convene separately or jointly.
