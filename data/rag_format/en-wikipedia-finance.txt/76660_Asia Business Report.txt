Asia Business Report


# Asia Business Report



***Asia Business Report*** (replaced by Business Today) is a business news programme produced by the BBC and is shown on International feed during the Asian morning hours. This programme used to be available exclusively in Asia-Pacific, South Asia and Middle East but, as of a 1 February 2010 revamp, was aired worldwide. It was also aired on the UK's domestic UK feed of BBC News channel and BBC One channel three times daily in the early hours of the morning as part of the *Newsday* programme. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, Asia Business Report was only followed on BBC World News at 2330 GMT, 0030 GMT, and 0130 GMT.

It is broadcast from the BBC's bureau which is in Singapore's central business district. The main presenter is Steve Lai.

Steve Lai announced on 7 May 2024 in the programme that Asia Business Report was coming to an end and that it was the final edition that he presented, as the programme was to be replaced by Business Today, uniting Asia Business Report and World Business Report under one brand.
