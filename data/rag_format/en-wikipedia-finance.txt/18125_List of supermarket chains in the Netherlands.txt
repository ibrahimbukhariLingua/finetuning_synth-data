| Albert Heijn | 1048 | Ahold Delhaize | 27 May 1887 | Albert Heijn founded a grocery store in 1887 and over the years opened multiple locations and a central warehouse. He started roasting his own brand of coffee and producing other self-made items in the 1890s and early 1900s. In 1920, a company called Maatschappij tot Exploitatie der Fabrieken en Handelszaken was formed and Anton Jurgens of Unilever bought a 50% share, which was later bought back by the Heijn family. In 1941, the Purchasing Director had to go into hiding due to his Jewish heritage and was helped by Gerrit Heijn. The chain went public in 1948 and opened its first self-service store in 1952 and first supermarket in 1955. The company grew through acquisitions and in 1973 became part of Ahold NV, which helped it expand into foreign markets. The company faced a decline in market share in 2003, but expanded into Belgium and the Caribbean, but withdrew from the German market in 2018. |
| Aldi | 500+ | Aldi Nord group | 10 July 1946 | Karl and Theo Albrecht's mother opened a small store in Germany in 1913 and they both worked in the store, Karl worked in a delicatessen. In 1945, Karl and Theo took over the family business, and by 1950 they owned 13 stores in the Ruhr Valley. They had a unique strategy of subtracting the legal maximum rebate of 3% before sale and removing merchandise that did not sell from their shelves. The brothers split the company in 1960 over a dispute about whether to sell cigarettes, forming Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd which became financially and legally separate in 1966. They started expanding internationally in 1967, with Aldi Süd acquiring the grocery chain Hofer in Austria and Aldi Nord opening its first stores abroad in the Netherlands in 1973. They retired as CEOs in 1993, and control of the company was placed in the hands of private family foundations. |
| Boni | 43 | independent | 1972 | Boni is a Dutch supermarket chain that was founded in 1972 by Gerrit Klaassen as a family business. The name "Boni" comes from the word "bonus" and means "of the good" in Latin. The first store had a discount look and a wide variety of inexpensive products. Boni was originally part of Prisma Food Retail, but became an independent chain after Prisma was sold to Sligro Food Group in 2001. The company is one of 14 members of the purchasing association Superunie. The head office and distribution center are located in Nijkerk. In 2015, Boni acquired three C1000 stores, and in 2018 opened a new branch in Heerde, which was the first to experiment with a new store formula. The company currently has around 43 stores, mainly located in the center, west, and north of the country, near the A28 freeway. |

The formula established itself mainly in Southwest Netherlands and still had 29 stores in 2018. Originally a discount supermarket, MCD was later transformed into a service supermarket formula. Parent company Boon Food Group launched the new formula Boon's Markt in Vlaardingen in 2013. The intention was to connect more with local consumers, while getting rid of MCD's expensive image. In 2017, it was announced that Boon Food Group wanted to phase out the MCD brand completely by renaming it Boon's Markt. |
