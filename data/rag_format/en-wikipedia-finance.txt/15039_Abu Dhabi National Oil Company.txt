Abu Dhabi National Oil Company


# Abu Dhabi National Oil Company



The **Abu Dhabi National Oil Company** (Arabic: شركة بترول أبو ظبي الوطنية), known by its acronym **ADNOC**, is the state-owned oil company of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

It is the world's 12th largest oil company by production. As of 2021, the company has an oil production capacity exceeding 4 million bpd with plans to increase to 5 million bpd by 2030. It is the United Arab Emirate's largest oil company.

ADNOC's output was roughly flat at about 2.5 million barrels per day during the 1990s. It stood at 2.9 mbpd in 2008. Although its financial indicators are difficult to assess as the company has been described as secretive, it has also been described as efficient and well managed.

ADNOC is one of few oil companies in the world to make a substantial investment to increase oil production amid growing pressure to reduce output due to climate change.


## History

In November 2019, ADNOC received approval from the emirate's Supreme Petroleum Council to list its flagship Murban crude oil as a futures contract on an international stock exchange. Murban is a highly prized grade of crude oil that accounts for about half of the UAE's total oil output of about 3 million barrels per day.

A joint venture between ADNOC and the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) was launched in July 2020 to invest in chemicals projects in the planned Ruwais Derivatives Park. ADNOC will have a 60% stake while ADQ will hold a 40% share.

In December 2021, ADNOC and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA) announced a $3.6 billion project to aim to reduce the carbon footprint of ADNOC's offshore production operations by more than 30%.

In December 2022, it was announced ADNOC had acquired a 24.9% stake in Austrian integrated oil, gas, and petrochemical company, OMV.

In December 2023, ADNOC agreed to acquire OCI's entire stake in ammonia and urea producer Fertiglobe for $3.62 billion.


## Operations

As of November 2019, the UAE holds the sixth-largest proven reserves of oil in the world at 105 billion barrels. Most of these reserves are located in Abu Dhabi.

ADNOC is one of the world's largest energy companies measured by both reserves and production. ADNOC has 16 subsidiary companies in upstream, midstream, and downstream stages of production. ADNOC develops both onshore and offshore gas fields. The company operates two oil refineries, Ruwais Refinery and Umm Al Nar. ADNOC exports natural gas in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in addition to producing supplies for local electricity and water utilities, to other domestic industries including petrochemicals plants, and for re-injection into reservoirs.


### Foreign direct investment

Major investments were made to ADNOC in 2019 by US asset managers BlackRock and KKR and Italian investment firm Eni. The US firms acquired about 40% of ADNOC's pipeline assets for about $4 billion while Eni SpA took a 20% stake in Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company for over $3 billion. Austria's OMV also invested about $2.8 billion, about 15% in ADNOC's refining business in partnership with Eni.

Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC completed a deal with ADNOC in May 2019 that gives GIC a 6% share in ADNOC's pipeline infrastructure. The deal is valued at $600 million.


### Headquarters

The building incorporates energy efficiency and sustainable engineering technologies, such as a double skin façade, photovoltaic glazing, LED exterior lighting. Designed by HOK, the overall building complex consisting of more than 65 floors with an office tower, corniche club, crisis management center, a heritage museum, and other support facilities was opened in 2001.
