## Geschichte

The company was founded in 1987 as *Gries & Heissel Bankiers KG* by Thomas Gries and Wolfgang Heissel in Berlin in the legal form of a Limited partnership. In 1989, another location was opened in Frankfurt am Main. One year later, the board members and founders received the "Best Entrepreneur of the Year" award. In 1992, the majority of shares were taken over by *Berliner Grundkreditbank eG*, which in turn became part of *Berliner Volksbank eG* in 1999.

Since the end of 1999, *Gries & Heissel* has been a subsidiary of the Wiesbaden-based financial services provider *Delta Lloyd Deutschland AG*, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Delta Lloyd Groep, Amsterdam, and thus part of the internationally operating Aviva - Group.

In 2000, the Frankfurt location was relocated to Wiesbaden, the headquarters of the bank until the middle of 2012. Other former branches in Düsseldorf and Hamburg were closed as part of a restructuring.

In August 2010, *Delta Lloyd Deutschland AG* announced that it had sold the bank to CR Rashid International F.Z.C., Dubai. In November 2010, however, it was announced that the sale was instead made to private investors.

In 2011, it was announced that, on the basis of a cooperation agreement with the Sydbank, the business with high net worth individuals would not be continued by *Gries & Heissel* (with effect from 1 January 2012) and customers would be able to continue this with the Sydbank. In April 2012 it was announced that the majority of the bank was acquired by Euro Yatirim Menkul Degerler A.S., Istanbul, and that BaFin had not objected after the conclusion of the proprietor control process.

At the end of July 2012, the company was renamed in Eurocity Bank AG. In mid-August 2012, the company's headquarter was relocated from Wiesbaden to Frankfurt am Main.

In 2016, Euro Yatirim Holding A.S. handed over the capital and voting rights of Eurocity Bank AG to the Austrian shareholders through the sale of voting shares.
