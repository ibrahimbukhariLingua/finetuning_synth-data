**Bernd Bergmair** (also spelled **Bernard Bergemar**, born 1968 in Linz) is an Austrian businessman. He was previously a majority owner of privately held MindGeek, the Luxembourg-based media conglomerate behind popular porn sites such as Pornhub.


## Early life

He grew up as the son of farmers in Ansfelden, attended grammar school in Linz and transferred to HLBLA St. Florian. He then studied at the University of Linz, graduating in 1992 with a thesis on a topic related to corporate acquisition: Evaluation of corporations and financing strategies in connection with M & A, LBO and MBO. He worked for Goldman Sachs in New York City. In 2006 he became the owner of the porn website RedTube and in 2013 he sold the site to Manwin, now known as Aylo.


## MindGeek

In December 2020, the *Financial Times* published a report on MindGeek's ownership, revealing that Bergmair or "Bernard Bergemar" as he had used in court documents was the company's majority owner. The *Financial Times* report prompted a parliamentary inquiry into Pornhub's practices in Canada, in which MindGeek directors and minority owners David Tassillo and Feras Antoon named a "Bernard Bergemar" as the principal owner. He owned more than half of the shares, but was a passive investor and not involved in the day-to-day business. British research platform Tortoise Media and Austrian magazine *Dossier* cooperated on an investigation.

Company records showed Bergemar lived in China, but was found to be actually living in a mansion in London after the investigation by Tortoise Media. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈSoon after, his Brazilian wife Priscila Bergmair told *The Sunday Times* that she wanted her husband to cut ties with the company.
In March 2023, Ethical Capital Partners purchased MindGeek, later renaming the media company to Aylo.
