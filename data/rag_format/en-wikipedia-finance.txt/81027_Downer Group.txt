## History

Downer's foundations were laid in the 19th century, when Walkers Limited and Clyde Engineering were founded in Australia, and the Public Works Department and Electrical Telegraph Department were founded in New Zealand. They merged in the 20th century to form parts of the Downer Group. The 20th century also saw the purchase of companies that now make up Downer's core divisions: railway manufacturer Evans Deakin & Company (EDI) and mining contractor Roche Brothers.

In 1933, the Downer Group was founded in New Zealand by Arnold Fielder Downer, as Downer & Co, focusing on providing engineering and construction services to the public and private infrastructure sectors in New Zealand, including the New Zealand Public Works Department. In 1954, Downer & Co merged with William Cable Holdings and, in 1964, with A & G Price, to form Cable Price Downer.

In 1994, Downer merged with Hong Kong-based Paul YITC. In 1996, the company purchased Works Corporation, the state-owned enterprise civil construction arm of the New Zealand Ministry of Works & Development. In 1997, mining contractor Roche Brothers was acquired. In 1998, Downer purchased major roads contractor Technic Group, and was first listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

In 2000, road-sealing business Bitumix was acquired from BP. In 2001, Downer merged with Evans Deakin Industries to form Downer EDI. Between 2003 and 2008, Downer also acquired Stork, QCC, Snowden, Emoleum and Excell Corporation. In October 2014, the construction assets of Tenix were acquired.

In March 2017, Downer acquired Hawkins, one of New Zealand's largest builders, and in June 2017, took majority ownership of Spotless Group Holdings through a hostile takeover. It took full ownership of Spotless for $1.27 billion in October 2020. The Spotless acquisition was the largest in Downer's history.

## Use of pseudoscience

In 2019 Downer admitted to using dowsing, in an attempt to find water pipes while contracting to the Wellington City Council. Dowsing is considered a pseudoscience and there is no scientific evidence that it is any more effective than random chance. Downer told New Zealand Skeptic's chair Craig Shearer that Downer has no concern about the public perception that ratepayer money is being spent on a technique considered pseudoscience. Downer's general manager of business excellence and reputation Brooke Dahlberg said "the method is safe, and it has no plan to ban staff from using it – the choice to use it was up to individual employees."

In December 2019, at the New Zealand Skeptics annual conference, the Downer Group was co-awarded the Bent Spoon by NZ Skeptics for "showing the most egregious gullibility in 2019" for the contractor's use of water divining to find underground pipes.


## Sponsorships

Downer Group was the naming rights sponsor of the NRL Auckland Nines in 2016 and 2017. It also sponsored the 2016 Anzac Test at the Newcastle International Sports Centre and the 2018 World Club Challenge. Downer will be the major sponsor of the Rugby League World Cup 9s.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ
