A comparison of tax rates by countries is difficult and somewhat subjective, as tax laws in most countries are extremely complex and the tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. The list focuses on the main types of taxes: corporate tax, individual income tax, and sales tax, including VAT and GST and capital gains tax, but does not list wealth tax or inheritance tax.

Personal income tax includes all applicable taxes, including all unvested social security contributions. Vested social security contributions are not included as they contribute to the personal wealth and will be paid back upon retirement or emigration, either as lump sum or as pension. Only social security contributions without a ceiling can be included in the highest marginal tax rate as only those are effectively a tax for general distribution among the population.

Some other taxes (for instance property tax, substantial in many countries, such as the United States) and income tax are not shown here. The table is not exhaustive in representing the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country. The tax rates displayed are marginal and do not account for deductions, exemptions or rebates. The effective rate is usually lower than the marginal rate. The tax rates given for federations (such as the United States and Canada) are averages and vary depending on the state or province. Territories that have different rates to their respective nation are in italics.
