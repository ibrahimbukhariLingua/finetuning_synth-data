The Una Group


# The Una Group



'***The Una Group'*** is a range of businesses under 3 core areas: commercial property, business services and environmental activities.

The Una Group is based at Airport Business Centre in Plymouth. This was originally home to Stafford Miller and Sensodyne toothpaste. It was developed into a business services & support space in 2004.

The UNA Group was formed by individuals who got together for one business project and found that by working together, other opportunities arose which could be better tackled by the group than by any one individual working alone, hence UNA - Latin for "all together as one". This reflects the Una Group's business philosophy.
