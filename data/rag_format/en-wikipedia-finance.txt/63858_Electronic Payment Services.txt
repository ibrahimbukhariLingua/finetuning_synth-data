# Electronic Payment Services



**Electronic Payment Services** (simplified Chinese: 易办事; traditional Chinese: 易辦事; pinyin: *Yì bànshì*), commonly known as **EPS**, is an electronic payment system based in Hong Kong, Macau, and with limited acceptance in Shenzhen since it began operations in 1985. The service is provided by **EPS Company (Hong Kong) Limited** which currently has over 30,000 acceptance locations.


## System

In each retail location, a terminal is installed and is usually connected to the POS system of the retailer. The terminal may also be independently connected to banks through the public phone system.

Transactions approved before the cut-off time are batched into a payment made directly to the retailer's account by the end of the business day.


## Service


### ATM card payment

EPS entails the simple use of an ATM card or a credit card with ATM capability issued by a member bank of the EPS, acting as a debit card. No application for the service is required.

The EPS device is a dual-unit device consisting of a removable card processor and a stationary base that serves as a charger and data link. Some retailers may use an integrated machine. In such situations, the customer inserts the card into the machine directly and waits for the retailer's acknowledgement before proceeding to the rest of the steps.


### EasyCash service

EasyCash (Chinese: 提款易) allows card holders to withdraw cash at over 1,200 locations in Hong Kong upon a regular purchase by EPS. The cash withdrawal amount must be in units of $100, up to $500. EPS EasyCash service is a kind of cashback service.

EPS EasyCash service is available at Hong Kong–based chain stores such as Gourmet, Great, IKEA, Mannings, MarketPlace, Massimo Dutti, Circle K, Oliver's, Parknshop, Taste, ThreeSixty, Vango, China Resources Vanguard (CRV), V'ole and Wellcome.


### PPS

PPS (Chinese: 繳費靈) is a service which allows card holders to pay bills using the phone or the internet. To use the service, the card holder must swipe the ATM card or the credit card with ATM capability through a PPS terminal to create an account. Afterwards, the account may be used to pay bills either through the PPS hotline, website or the mobile application.
