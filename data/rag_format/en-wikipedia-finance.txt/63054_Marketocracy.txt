Marketocracy was mentioned in the book Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything (ISBN 1591841933) The book explores how some companies in the early 21st century have used mass collaboration (also called peer production) and open-source technology such as wikis to be successful.

With the passing of CEO and Founder Ken Kam in 2019, the future of the firm was left in limbo. In 2020, 11 Marketocracy Masters came together to acquire the company name and data to continue Ken's vision. They expect to re-launch as Marketocracy Masters in 2022.
