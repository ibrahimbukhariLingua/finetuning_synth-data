The Reader's Digest Association, Inc. (RDA), a global media and direct marketing company, is best known for its flagship publication founded in 1922, Reader's Digest. The company was founded by husband and wife DeWitt and Lila Bell Wallace in 1922 with the first publication of Reader's Digest magazine, but grew to include a diverse range of magazines, books, music, DVDs and online content. As chairman and CEO of the company that published the world's most widely read magazine, Reader's Digest, Ryder was responsible for a total global circulation of almost 40 million and well over 100 million readers in 60+ countries, with company sales of nearly $2.5 billion.

## Food and Wine Industry

Food and wine were long-time hobbies for Ryder and he made it part of his career. He bought Cuisine Magazine while working at CBS and then bought Food & Wine Magazine while at American Express. As part of a plan to revitalize Food & Wine, Ryder created the Aspen Food & Wine Classic, a festival which became a great success and inspired dozens of imitators around the world. In January 1984 American Express Europe launched Departures magazine as an exclusive cardmember benefit. In 1989 control passed to American Express Publishing.

While at Reader's Digest Association, Ryder was responsible for the acquisition of Allrecipes.com and *Taste of Home*, the latter part of the home-cook publishing pioneer Reiman Publishing of Wisconsin. He also oversaw the creation of Every Day With Rachael Ray Magazine, one of the most successful magazine launches in recent history.

Ryder began collecting wines while in college and ultimately created one of the great collections in the US, much of which was sold at a rare, single-seller sale at Sotheby's in 2007. The proceeds funded a family foundation which in its early days benefited a number of Louisiana organizations helping the state recover from Hurricane Katrina.

He invested in a number of restaurant start-ups, in Connecticut with his son, and in New York, with Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, where he was an early investor in Shake Shack among other brands. Ryder has also written extensively about food and wine in publications such as Travel & Leisure, Food & Wine, Reader's Digest, Barron's, Huffington Post and The Daily Meal. He had plans to open a gourmet market in Vero Beach, FL in 2020.
