Spencer Dock


# Spencer Dock



**Spencer Dock** (Irish: *Duga Spencer*) is a former wharf area, close to where the Royal Canal meets the River Liffey, in the North Wall area of Dublin, Ireland. As of the 21st century, the area has been redeveloped with occupants of the Spencer Dock development including the Convention Centre Dublin, PricewaterhouseCoopers' Irish headquarters, Credit Suisse and TMF Group. The Central Bank of Ireland and NTMA have offices in the nearby Dublin Landings development.

The main building in the area was previously the former North Wall railway station which formed the terminus bringing goods and passengers to the quays.


## History

The dockland area was originally part of the end of the Royal Canal, which still reaches the River Liffey here.


### 1873 docks complex

The dock was constructed in 1873 to accommodate the coal ships and other barges primarily of the Midland Great Western Railway Company and served as both a railway and canal depot. The original Sheriff Street Drawbridge was constructed in 1873 but replaced by the Sheriff Street Lifting Bridge in 1941.

The name relates to John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; who opened the docks complex in 1873; conferring a knighthood on MGWR chairman Ralph Cusack at the same time.


### Modern Spencer Dock development

Most of the 206,000 m² (51 acre) site now known as *Spencer Dock* was owned by Córas Iompair Éireann for much of the 20th century. With increasing land values in the early 2000s and as the freight yards became surplus to requirements, it sold the land on to Treasury Holdings while retaining a 17.5% interest in the freehold. CIÉ later also sold its minority holding to a property fund managed by Davy Group. All 614 apartments in the development were sold to private buyers.

Following the appointment of receivers over the office property, the office complex was sold in its entirety for €242m in 2016. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Geography

The original area was Spencer Dock area was defined by a ribbon of development from the Liffey along the Royal Canal up to about the Main Dublin to Belfast railway line, the two parts of Spencer Dock being separated by the bridge at Sheriff Street and separated from the Liffey by a sea lock. The modern development is defined as being part of the North Wall area of Dublin Docklands. The Point Village area lies to the east with Dublin Docklands claiming to be a small area between the two. One focal point of the area is the Luas tram stop and the adjacent park.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Infrastructure


### Rail

Spencer Dock is served by the Docklands railway station on Sheriff Street, at the north end of the site. Commuter services to the Dublin Docklands area on the Western Commuter line began in March 2007. Under the Transport 21 initiative, at one time due for completion by 2018, the station was to move south to a permanent location along New Wapping Street. This station, proposed to connect to an extended Luas Red line, was deferred due to the Post-2008 Irish economic downturn.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### Bridges

The Sheriff Street Lifting Bridge was installed between 1939 and 1941. A single-span bascule bridge, it replaces the earlier James Price designed swivel bridge of 1873 which was the first mechanical crossing of Spencer Dock, and separated its inner and outer portions.
