ASCII Group


# ASCII Group



Founded in 1984, **The ASCII Group, Inc.** is the oldest and largest group of independent information technology (IT) solution providers, systems integrators, managed service providers (MSP) and value added resellers (VAR). ASCII is the largest paying community of independent computer solution providers, system integrators, and valued added resellers in the world.


## History

The original ASCII business model was created in 1984 by Alan Weinberger who forged the network out of a failing franchise of software retail stores owned by Ashton-Tate, a major software publisher. 40 independent software retailers decided to join together as a buying group and pay monthly fees to support their organization, in turn supporting each other and their programs for mutual benefit.

Debuting in 2000, ASCII holds 9 annual Success Summits each year throughout the United States and Canada. In 2015, ASCII partnered with TTR, Inc. and announced a support service for sales tax questions.
