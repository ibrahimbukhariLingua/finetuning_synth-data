**Qatar National Bank** (**QNB Group**) (Arabic: بنك قطر الوطني) is a Qatari multinational commercial bank headquartered in Doha, Qatar. It was founded in 1964 and currently has subsidiaries and associates in 31 countries on three continents. The bank's ownership is evenly divided between the Qatar Investment Authority and members of the public.


## History

QNB was founded on 6 June 1964 as the country's first domestically-owned commercial bank. It had 35 employees in its first year and was initially headquartered in a government-owned building in Qatar's capital city, Doha. The two currencies in circulation at the time were the Indian rupee and British pound. As Qatar's population continued increasing through the century, QNB started establishing branches in other parts of the country.

In 1974, the first branches outside of Doha were opened in Al Khor and Mesaieed. The bank installed its first ATMs in 1988 in its Doha branches, and introduced VISA cards for its clients the next year.

In 2013, QNB acquired Egypt's then-largest private-sector bank, National Société Générale Bank, from Société Générale, and rebranded it QNB Al Ahli. By 2015, it had established 76 branches in Qatar. In 2016, QNB acquired Istanbul-based Finansbank from National Bank of Greece. As of 2017, QNB also owned an 82.59 percent stake in Bank QNB Indonesia.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net profit was QR 9.5 billion (US$ 2.6 billion). Total assets also increased by 8% since September 30, 2019, to reach QR986 billion (US$271 billion).

In 2024, QNB streamlined its brand identity in two of its main overseas markets, by phasing out the brands Al Ahli in Egypt and Finansbank in Turkey.
