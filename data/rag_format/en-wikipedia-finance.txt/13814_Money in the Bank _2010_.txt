Money in the Bank (2010)


# Money in the Bank (2010)



The 2010 **Money in the Bank** was the inaugural Money in the Bank professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on Sunday, July 18, 2010, at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri. The event included two Money in the Bank ladder matches, one for each brand. The eponymous ladder match was previously held at WrestleMania from 2005 to 2010. Following WrestleMania XXVI in March, the match concept was spun off into its own PPV event, replacing Night of Champions, which had moved to September replacing Breaking Point. The event received 169,000 pay-per-view buys.

Eight matches were contested at the event, including the two Money in the Bank ladder matches. The Miz won Raw's ladder match to earn a WWE Championship match at a time of his choosing within the next year, while in the opening bout, Kane won SmackDown's ladder match for the same opportunity for the World Championship. In the main event, Sheamus retained the WWE Championship against John Cena in a Steel Cage match, following an interference from The Nexus. The undercard featured The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd) retaining the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship against The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and Layla retaining the WWE Women's Championship against Kelly Kelly. Also on the card, Rey Mysterio defeated Jack Swagger to retain the World Championship, only to lose it minutes later to Kane, who cashed in the Money in the Bank contract he won earlier in the event to defeat Mysterio for the title.


## Production


### Background

In 2005, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) established the Money in the Bank ladder match as an annual match at their marquee event, WrestleMania, debuting at WrestleMania 21. The match features multiple wrestlers using ladders to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship at any time within the next year. Following WrestleMania XXVI in March 2010, WWE established a separate Money in the Bank event as a gimmick pay-per-view (PPV); the match subsequently ceased being held at WrestleMania. The inaugural event was held on July 18, 2010, at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri. Unlike WrestleMania, the Money in the Bank event included two ladder matches. One was exclusive to wrestlers from the Raw brand while the other was exclusive to those from SmackDown. Raw's match granted a contract for a WWE Championship match while SmackDown's granted a World Heavyweight Championship match contract.


### Storylines

Money in the Bank comprised professional wrestling matches involving professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows *Raw* and *SmackDown* with the Raw and SmackDown brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.

At Fatal 4-Way, the Money in the Bank ladder match was scheduled for a namesake pay-per-view. On the June 25 episode of *SmackDown*, it was revealed that two Money in the Bank ladder matches would be held at the event for the Raw and SmackDown brands respectively, with the winners of the matches given a title match for the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship respectively at a time of their choosing within the next 12 months. Three days later, *Raw* guest host Rob Zombie named his brand's eight competitors: Randy Orton, The Miz, R-Truth, Chris Jericho, Evan Bourne, Ted DiBiase Jr., John Morrison, and Edge. On the July 5 episode of *Raw*, The Miz attacked and injured R-Truth; he was taken out of the Money in the Bank match and replaced with Mark Henry the following week.

On June 30, six of the competitors for the SmackDown brand's match were named: Matt Hardy, Kane, Cody Rhodes, Christian, Kofi Kingston, and Big Show. On the July 9 episode of *SmackDown*, Dolph Ziggler defeated Montel Vontavious Porter and Chavo Guerrero Jr. in a triple threat match to qualify for SmackDown's ladder match. On the same night, Drew McIntyre earned the final spot by pinning Kofi Kingston.

The main rivalry from the SmackDown brand heading into the Money in the Bank event was between Rey Mysterio and Jack Swagger over the World Heavyweight Championship. Mysterio replaced The Undertaker, who was found in a vegetative state by his brother Kane, in a fatal four-way match, which also involved defending Champion Swagger, CM Punk and Big Show, to become a two-time World Heavyweight Champion. On the June 25 episode of *SmackDown*, a rematch between Swagger and Mysterio was scheduled for Money in the Bank.

The main rivalry from the Raw brand heading into Money in the Bank was between WWE Champion Sheamus and John Cena. Sheamus won the title at the Fatal 4-Way event after interference from seven of the contestants from the first season of *NXT*, collectively known as "The Nexus". The next night on *Raw*, John Cena invoked his rematch clause, but The Nexus interrupted the match. The following week on *Raw*, Raw's anonymous general manager scheduled a Steel Cage match between Sheamus and Cena to ensure no outside interference from The Nexus.

Midway through the match, Kingston performed a Boom Drop off a ladder on McIntyre through a broadcast table. Big Show climbed a super-sized ladder he had set up, but Kane pushed the ladder over and Christian and Rhodes buried Big Show under multiple ladders.

In the end, Swagger applied an ankle lock on Mysterio, but Mysterio removed his boot, performed a hurricanrana on Swagger and pinned Swagger with a rana to retain the title. After the match, Swagger attacked Mysterio, but Kane entered the ring and chased off Swagger. After that, Kane then returned to the ring with referee Charles Robinson and his briefcase, electing to cash in his contract, marking the first time a wrestler cashed in their briefcase on the same night they won it. Kane then chokeslammed an injured Mysterio before executing a Tombstone Piledriver to win the World Heavyweight title in 54 seconds.

Next, Layla defended the WWE Women's Championship against Kelly Kelly. In the end, Kelly attempted a sunset flip on Layla, who countered into a roll-up to retain the title.

After that was the Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE Championship match contract involving Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Edge, Evan Bourne, John Morrison, The Miz, Mark Henry, and Ted DiBiase Jr. During the match, Orton performed an elevated DDT on Bourne using a ladder. The Miz attempted a catapult on Morrison into a ladder, but Morrison climbed the ladder and used another ladder to climb a ladder set up underneath the briefcase. Edge trapped Morrison in the ladder and, along with The Miz, drove another ladder into Morrison. Morrison performed a springboard roundhouse kick using the ring apron on Henry, Jericho performed a Codebreaker on Henry and Edge performed a spear on Henry. In the end, Orton attempted to retrieve the briefcase but The Miz pushed the ladder, causing Orton to fall, and retrieved the briefcase to win the match.


### Main event

In the main event, Sheamus defended the WWE Championship against John Cena in a Steel Cage match. Sheamus threw Cena into the cage first. It was followed by Cena doing the same. Cena intercepted Sheamus with a twisted slam for a two count. Sheamus attacked with axe handles. After two axe handles, Cena countered the third one and lifted Sheamus for the Attitude Adjustment, but Sheamus escaped. After battling on the top rope, Cena took Sheamus down with a bulldog from the top turnbuckle only for Sheamus to kickout. Sheamus was then laid down for the Five Knuckle Shuffle. Cena tried another Five Knuckle Shuffle from the top turnbuckle but Sheamus moved out of the way. He tied Cena to the middle rope and climbed through Cena to the top. Cena freed himself and tried to stop Sheamus. Sheamus then caught Cena in a sleeper hold which interesting sequence on the top rope. Sheamus delivered a Brogue Kick for a near fall. He took Cena for a Celtic Cross; but Cena countered into a Attitude Adjustment, which Sheamus recountered into Irish Curse Backbreaker. Cena delivered the Attitude Adjustment only to score a near fall. The Nexus (led by Wade Barrett) interfered with Michael Tarver bringing in Bolt Cutters. A referee at the outside stole the cutters and ran away. Another referee threw away key to the cage when Barrett asked for it. A brawl between Cena and Sheamus ended up hurting the referee inside the ring. Cena took Sheamus into the STF and Sheamus tapped out but no one saw. Cena tried to escape the cage but Justin Gabriel interfered only to be thrown off the cage. More Nexus members started interfering Cena and Sheamus recovered and climbed the cage quickly. He intercepted Heath Slater and came off and escaped the arena into the crowd, winning the match and retaining the championship. After the match, Cena attacked Darren Young and Tarver at the ringside and walked away with Tarver's Nexus Armband.


## Reception

Andy McNamara, a reviewer for the Canadian Online Explorer's wrestling section, rated both Money in the Bank ladder matches a 4 out of 5, the WWE Championship match a 3 out of 5, and the World Heavyweight Championship match a 3.5 out of 5. The event was attended live by a crowd of 8,000 fans. Money in the Bank drew 169,000 pay-per-view buys, approximately 99,000 of which came in the United States.


## Aftermath

Kane was then involved in a feud with his (kayfabe) brother The Undertaker, facing him on several occasions. The next night on *Raw*, Edge, Chris Jericho and Randy Orton faced off in a triple threat match, where the winner would face Sheamus at SummerSlam for the WWE Championship, which Orton won. At SummerSlam, due to Orton winning the match via disqualification, Orton did not win the title.

On the following episode of *SmackDown*, Rey Mysterio faced Jack Swagger in a two out of three falls match to determine Kane's opponent at SummerSlam. Mysterio defeated Swagger to earn a championship rematch, but was unsuccessful in regaining the championship at the event.

On the November 22 episode of *Raw*, The Miz successfully cashed in the briefcase on Randy Orton (who won the title back at Night of Champions) to win the WWE Championship.

A second Money in the Bank event occurred the following year, thus establishing the show as an annual pay-per-view for the promotion, which became simply known as "WWE" in April 2011. While originally only for men, a women's version of the Money in the Bank ladder match was introduced at the 2017 event, and each year's show now features a men's and women's match. While Money in the Bank had been established as one of WWE's monthly PPVs held between their "Big Four" shows (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series), in August 2021, WWE President and Chief Revenue Officer Nick Khan referred to Money in the Bank as one of the company's "five annual tentpoles", thus elevating the event's status as one of WWE's five biggest events of the year, referred to as the "Big Five".
