# Carbonfund.org



**The Carbonfund.org Foundation** (known as **Carbonfund.org**) was formerly a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization based in East Aurora, New York. It still provides carbon offsetting and greenhouse gas reduction options to individuals, businesses, and organizations. Carbonfund.org Foundation purchases and retires certified carbon offsets on behalf of its donors. Donors are given a choice of project type to which they may donate, including renewable energy, reforestation, and energy efficiency projects. Carbonfund.org Foundation sources carbon credits verified by the Verra carbon standard (formerly VCS) and Gold Standard. The organization has helped develop four Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) projects in Brazil under the VERRA and Climate, Community and Biodiversity standards.

Carbonfund.org also operates a traditional, co-ed, overnight summer camp in New Hampshire. Camp Quinebarge was founded in 1936, and was purchased by Carbonfund.org in 2012. President Eric Carlson is an alumnus of Quinebarge and now serves as executive director alongside Camp Director Nick Hercules. Camp Quinebarge is a traditional camp with an emphasis on nature/environmental education.
