## History

The mutual fund industry in India originally began in 1963 with the Unit Trust of India **(UTI)** as a Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India initiative. Launched on 29 June 1987, SBI Mutual Fund became the first non-**UTI mutual fund** in India. In July 2004, State Bank of India decided to divest 37 per cent of its holding in its mutual fund arm, SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd, to Societe Generale Asset Management, for an amount in excess of $35 million.

Post-divestment, State Bank of India's stake in the mutual fund arm came down to 67%. In May 2011, Amundi picked up 37% stake in SBI Funds Management, that was held by Societe Generale Asset Management, as part of a global move to merge its asset management business with Crédit Agricole.

SBI Funds Management Private Limited (SBIFMPL) has been appointed as the Asset Management Company of the SBI Mutual Fund. SBIFMPL is a joint venture between the State Bank of India, an Indian public sector bank, and Amundi, a European asset management company.
