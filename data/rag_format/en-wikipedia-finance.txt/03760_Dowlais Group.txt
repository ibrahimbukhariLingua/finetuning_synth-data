## History

In March 2023, Melrose Industries announced that it would demerge GKN Automotive and GKN Powder Metallurgy from GKN as Dowlais Group. The name selected, "Dowlais Group", was intended to evoke the Dowlais Ironworks where GKN licensed the Bessemer process, using it to produce steel, in 1865.

GKN Automotive has its origins in the company, J. W. Garrington, which specialised in forgings; the forgings produced at the Garrington Darlaston plant, later supplemented by a large plant at Bromsgrove, enabled GKN to become a major supplier of crankshafts, connecting rods, half-shafts and numerous smaller forged components to the UK auto-industry, which had a period of massive expansion during the interwar period and beyond. A new plant was established near Wellington, Shropshire, which was devoted to wheel production, and in the 1960s, the company became a manufacturer of constant-velocity joints, which are used to transfer the engine's power to the wheels.

GKN Powder Metallurgy has its origins in Hoeganaes Corporation (HC) in North America, which GKN acquired in 1998.

The demerger was completed on 20 April 2023.

On 29 January 2025, it was announced that American Axle had made an offer worth US$1.4 billion to acquire the company.
