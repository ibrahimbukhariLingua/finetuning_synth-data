The Stockholm Stock Exchange was acquired by futures exchange OM in 1998.

Since 2008, the Stockholm Stock Exchange has been part of Nasdaq, Inc. (formerly called *Nasdaq OMX Group*) and its Nasdaq Nordic markets. As of October 2014, the exchange operated under the legal name *Nasdaq OMX Stockholm AB* (renamed *Nasdaq Stockholm AB* in 2015).

Prior to the introduction of electronic trading on 1 June 1990, all trading was conducted on the floor of the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building.

Its normal trading sessions are from 09:00 to 17:30 on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.
