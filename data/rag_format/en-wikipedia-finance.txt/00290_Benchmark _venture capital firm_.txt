## Partner structure

Benchmark is noted for creating the first equal ownership and compensation structure for its partners. The "maverick" firm differs from most VC firms, which are named for their founders and are structured hierarchically; Benchmark was described by Fortune as "a lean operation in which its six full-time partners share profits equally." While there are no differentiation between its "junior partners" and "senior partners," there is also no CEO-like position held.
