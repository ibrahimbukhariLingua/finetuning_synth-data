## History


### Foundation of Marvel Communication SA (1990)

In 1990, Marc Bürki and Paolo Buzzi founded Marvel Communication SA, which specialised in developing software and web applications for the financial sector.


### Swissquote: the free financial platform (1996)

Marvel Communication SA released the financial platform Swissquote, which in 1996 became the first platform to offer free access to all securities traded on the Swiss stock exchange.


### Stock exchange listing of Swissquote (2000)

On 29 May 2000, Swissquote went public, listing 410,000 registered shares with a total value of CHF 100 million on the SIX Swiss Exchange under the symbol SQN. In the same year, the company obtained its banking license.


### Expansion into international markets (2001-2002)

In 2001, Swissquote gained access to the Swiss stock exchange (then SWX and Virt-X), the US stock exchanges NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX. In 2002, after the takeover of Consors (Switzerland) AG and customers of Skandia Bank Switzerland, Swissquote expanded its offering to include new markets, financial products and services.


### Partnerships and stages of development (2009–2016)

In 2009, Swissquote created a chair in quantitative finance at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and launched the company's first quant funds. In 2010, Swissquote made two significant acquisitions. In June, it acquired Tradejet AG, a Zurich-based online information platform and broker. Later, in October, it acquired ACM Advanced Currency Markets AG, expanding its operations to include online Forex trading. In May 2012, Swissquote expanded its offerings with the Swiss Derivatives OTC Trading System (Swiss DOTS) in collaboration with Goldman Sachs and UBS. A few years later, additional partners joined, including Vontobel, BNP Paribas, and Société Générale.

In February 2013, Swissquote partnered with Basellandschaftliche Kantonalbank to provide online mortgage services. In September of the same year, Swissquote expanded in the international market by acquiring MIG Bank, a major forex broker. In 2014, Swissquote and PostFinance established a long-term strategic partnership in online trading. From autumn 2015, Swissquote operated as a trading platform for PostFinance, handling stock exchange orders placed by PostFinance customers in e-trading.

In January 2015, following the Swiss National Bank's decision to discontinue the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 CHF per euro, Swissquote set aside a reserve of CHF 25 million without, however, compromising the profitability or soundness of the bank. On 9 February 2015, Swissquote Financial Services surrendered its Category 3 Investment Services License to the Malta Financial Services Authority.

In September 2015, the company launched Themes Trading, a new thematic investing service that provides customers with information to invest in identified trends. That year, Swissquote launched an Apple TV application that provides round-the-clock financial news coverage. Additionally, inspired by Pokémon GO, the company’s engineers also developed Swissquote GO, a geolocalised financial game in Switzerland.


### Expansion and new banking services (2018-2019)

In August 2018, Swissquote acquired the Luxembourg-based Internaxx Bank SA with around 12,000 clients and client assets of EUR 2 billion, gaining access to the European market. Following regulatory approval by the European Central Bank and the CSSF in Luxembourg, the company was renamed Swissquote Bank Europe SA and became a fully owned entity of the Swissquote Group. The acquisition coincided with regulatory changes by the European Securities and Markets Authority, which limited leverage for retail brokers and prohibited the marketing, distribution, and sale of binary options, indirectly benefiting Swissquote's business model.

In the same year, Swissquote launched its multi-currency credit card, which could be used to pay in 12 different currencies without conversion fees.

Swissquote maintains partnerships with major financial institutions such as Banque Pictet, UBS, BlackRock, Vontobel, HSBC, Zürcher Kantonalbank and others, enabling its clients to invest in investment funds.

Since October 2018, Swissquote offers the possibility to buy tokens with Swiss francs via their account and hold them in custody by participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs).

In 2019, the company expanded in the Asia-Pacific region by opening Swissquote Singapore Pte.

In November 2019, Swissquote reported suspicious funds amounting to $100 million from Blue Ocean Bank and the Helin Group to the money laundering office; the Swiss authorities then launched an investigation, and Swissquote blocked the funds.


### Launch of Yuh with PostFinance (2021)

On April 7, 2021, Yuh Ltd. was founded as a joint venture between Swissquote Bank AG and PostFinance AG in Switzerland. The Yuh app was launched to provide users with tools for paying, saving, and investing, offering options such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, thematic investments, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a focus on accessibility for beginners.


### Recent developments and strategic partnerships (2021-Present)

Since January 1, 2022, LUKB (Luzerner Kantonalbank) has become Swissquote's exclusive distribution partner for mortgages.

In October 2022, Swissquote launched a crypto exchange SQX and gained access to the Dubai Financial Market. On November 11-12, the platform experienced a massive DDoS attack and was down for a significant time.

Since 2023, Swissquote supports South African project Santé Solaire as part of its commitment to sustainable development projects.

In March 2023, as part of its Themes Trading offering, Swissquote introduced the Impact Investing portfolio. This portfolio enables clients to invest in quality stocks while directing 50% of dividends toward real-world projects, such as Solafrica’s initiative to bring solar power to a healthcare center in Burkina Faso.

In May 2023, Swissquote partnered with investment firm Stableton and Morningstar Indexes to launch an actively managed certificate (AMC) targeted at Swiss retail investors. The AMC provides exposure to 20 selected unicorn companies identified by Morningstar. Later that year, Swissquote introduced a new investment and savings solution for asset management.

In November 2023, Swissquote introduced the Swiss Real Estate Certificate, managed by Finstoy, a Lausanne-based wealth management firm with over a decade of experience. This certificate allows investors to access the Swiss real estate market by investing in a portfolio of real estate funds that own properties exclusively in Switzerland.

In October 2024, Swissquote introduced fractional share trading for retail investors and expanded its collaboration with BNP Paribas' Securities Services business.
