## Key elements of the plan

* A substantial extension of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), and the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), and considerable enhancement of both EWSS and CRSS
 + The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme will be extended beyond 30 June until 31 December 2021
 + The Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be extended in full for existing claimants beyond 30 June to 7 September. The scheme will close to new applicants from 1 July in recognition that, at that stage, there should be no new job lay-offs that are directly attributable to public health restrictions
 - The current weekly rates of support will be gradually reduced over three phases by €50 increments. The first phase of rate changes will apply from 7 September provided progress on reopening continues. Two further phases of changes will take place over the following months, on 16 November and 8 February, if progress continues as expected
 - PUP claims for students will be extended until the start of the 2021/2022 college year (final payment on 7 September). In addition, €10 million in assistance will provide supports for the forthcoming academic year for students impacted by COVID-19
* Complemented by a range of initiatives including extension of Commercial Rates Waiver, new additional Business Resumption Support Scheme, and extension of Tax Debt Warehousing Scheme
* Continuing to provide supports for worst-affected sectors including aviation, tourism and events as they continue to reopen, including the extension of 9% VAT rate for tourism and hospitality sector, supports for live entertainment and events sector, and a roadmap for the aviation sector
 + A roadmap for the recovery path for the aviation sector is rooted in the reopening of international travel, supports for workers and sectoral specific supports
 - Non-essential travel can return from 19 July and for travel within the European Union area, Ireland will be operating the EU Digital COVID-19 Certificate
 + As part of Government's support for the tourism sector, the lower tourism and hospitality VAT rate of 9% will be extended to 1 September 2022, and Fáilte Ireland will continue its support initiatives including through its Business Continuity Scheme or equivalent schemes
* Strategic investment that will drive the digital and green transition, as well as supporting social and economic recovery and job creation
* Overarching ambition to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2.5 million people in work by 2024
* Help people back into work, and into new sustainable job opportunities through increased activation, and reskilling and upskilling opportunities
* A pathway to a strong, resilient economy, aligned with the Government's green and digital ambitions
* Learn lessons from the pandemic by building a balanced and inclusive recovery, which leverages new ways of working, and by improving labour market supports and living standards
* Ensuring sustainable public finances for a lasting recovery
