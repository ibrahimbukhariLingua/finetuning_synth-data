The company had over 3,000 employees in 2009 and was the biggest employer of apprentices outside of government.

Since 2000, WesTrac has opened dealerships across China, and is one of the largest suppliers of Caterpillar products in the world.

In 2006, WesTrac closed its agricultural dealerships in Australia, resulting from a decision by Caterpillar to cease production of agricultural equipment. Customers of Westrac were concerned that their warranties would not be honoured.
