# Schulich School of Business



The **Schulich School of Business** is the business school of York University located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The institution provides undergraduate and graduate degree and diploma programs in business administration, finance, accounting, business analytics, public administration and international business as well as a number of PhD and executive programs. Originally known as the Faculty of Administrative Studies (FAS), it was renamed in 1995 after Seymour Schulich, a major benefactor who has donated $15 million to the school. The Dean of the School, Detlev Zwick, was appointed in 2021 after having served as Interim Dean for 15 months.

Primarily located at the Seymour Schulich Building on the Keele Campus in Toronto, Ontario, the school maintains an executive education centre in Toronto's Financial District and satellite campuses in Hyderabad, India, and Beijing, China. The school has satellite centres in Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, São Paulo, and Mexico City.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Schulich offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate business degrees. Schulich pioneered Canada's first International MBA (IMBA) and International BBA (iBBA) degrees, as well as the Kellogg-Schulich Executive MBA.


## History

The Schulich School of Business was known as the Faculty of Administrative Studies which was founded in 1966. Before the establishment of the Seymour Schulich Building on the Keele Campus in 2003, the school was run from a York University building, currently renamed as Health, Nursing & Environmental Studies Building. In 1995, following a major monetary donation from Canadian billionaire Seymour Schulich, the school underwent a series of changes that created the present-day Schulich School of Business.


## Campuses


### Seymour Schulich Building

The Seymour Schulich Building opened in August 2003 and cost $102 million. The building was jointly designed by Siamak Hariri and Robbie Young + Wright Architectural and was awarded the Governor General's Medal in Architecture in 2006. The Seymour Schulich Building and its Executive Learning Centre houses the Peter F. Bronfman Business Library, Executive Dining Room, Robert R. McEwen Auditorium, York Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Tuchner's Pub & Eatery, Starbucks, the central courtyard, the Executive Learning Centre hotel, and small lecture halls.

In December 2017, the $120 million York University Station opened directly across from the Seymour Schulich Building's main entrance. Designed by Foster + Partners, the station design uses natural light to try to subtly guide passengers from the entrance down to the platforms. With the Line 1 Yonge–University subway running underneath a lecture hall on Schulich's East Wing, in 2021, Metrolinx conducted a study to analyse the latest sound and vibration technology that was used to plan and design the Yonge North Subway Extension.
