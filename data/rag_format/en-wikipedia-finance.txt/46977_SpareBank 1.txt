## History

In 1996 the original members of the alliance, Sparebanken SMN, Sparebanken Nord-Norge, Sparebanken Rogaland and Sparebanken Vest founded the alliance, at first (but never branded) as **Sparebankgruppen**. The same year the company bought the life insurance company DAVID Livsforsikring, now SpareBank 1 Livsforsikring, in addition to part of the mutual fund company ODIN Forvaltning, now wholly owned by SpareBank 1. In 1997 the alliance of small savings banks Samarbeidende Sparebanker.

In 1998 the Swedish bank FöreningsSparbanken (now Swedbank) purchased 24% of the company. The same year Sparebank 1 established a credit card company followed in 1999 with the establishment of the real estate agent *EiendomsMegler 1*. The company also buys part of *First Securities*.

The same year SpareBank 1 purchased *VÅR Bank* from the labour union Landsorganisasjonen (LO). This bank was renamed *Bank 1 Oslo*, with branches in Oslo and Akershus while other branches of the bank were taken over by other alliance members.
