National Federation Of Industrial Organisations


# National Federation Of Industrial Organisations



The **National Federation Of Industrial Organisations** (FIO, Japanese: 全国産業別労働組合連合, Shinsanbetsu) was a national trade union federation in Japan.

The federation was a split from Sanbetsu, which took place in 1952. Always a small organisation, by 1967 it had only three affiliates and a total of 69,839 members. By 1978, it had 61,000 members, and that year, it formed a loose association with the Federation of Independent Unions (Churitsuroren), intending to merge in the future. In 1987, it merged with both Churitsuroren and the larger Japanese Confederation of Labour, to form the Japanese Trade Union Confederation.
