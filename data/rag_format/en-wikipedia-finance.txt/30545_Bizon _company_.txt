## Z055

Bizon America harvesters were produced only twenty-something. All of them went to Scandinavia. The harvester was produced in 1975, it already had a hydraulically foldable discharge pipe, loss sensors, wide tires, a cabin with sliding doors and, above all, a characteristic large grain tank, holding 3 tons of wheat, which is almost twice as much as in the Bizon Super. The capacity of the tank was used in it, partly due to the fact that the mounted short oblique auger poured the grain only into the center of the tank.


## Z056

The Z-056 combine, developed as the successor of the Z-050 combine in the "Super" type, is intended for harvesting four basic cereals, rape and some legumes from the trunk. The use of a swath pick-up enables harvesting with the two-stage method.
