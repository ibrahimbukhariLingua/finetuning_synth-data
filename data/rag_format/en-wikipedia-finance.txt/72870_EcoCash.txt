## History


### 1.1 Early History

Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, a wireless telecommunications company based in Zimbabwe announced in 2011 that they were launching a mobile money transfer service called EcoCash. The service was primarily targeted at Econet subscribers who would send money via text message to recipients who would cash out funds at an EcoCash agent. Large merchants such as OK Zimbabwe and TM Supermarket were recruited as partners for facilitating cash in and cash out transactions. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were also recruited as partners in the service to broaden the reach and accessibility of the service.
