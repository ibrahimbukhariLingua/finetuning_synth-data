Shopping is a popular social activity in Hong Kong, where basic items for sale do not draw any duties, sales taxation, or import taxation. Only specific import goods such as alcohol, tobacco, perfumes, cosmetics, cars and petroleum products have associated taxes. For companies, there is a 17.5% corporate tax, which is lower than international standards. Shoppers reportedly spend over US$5.2 billion a month in Hong Kong shops.

Hong Kong's proximity to manufacturing plants in China, as well as its status as a free port, allow it to sell and transport a wide variety of goods. There are few restrictions on merchandise vending, and therefore items such as realistic toy weapons are available. The two main shopping seasons are at Christmas and the Chinese New Year.

The region is unique in the sense that it is official languages are both Cantonese and English, which enables a healthy tourist trade with English-speaking customers as bilingual sales tags and salespeople are common, especially in tourist areas. The MTR subway and effective taxi service also facilitate Hong Kong's busy shopping industry.

## History

During its early colonial period, Hong Kong served as a port that sold far more than it consumed. Goods were mostly sold via mobile hawking or independent traders, with the majority of trade, utilities, shipping, and manufacturing handled by major business houses known as hongs. The establishment of banks and deposit institutions allowed people to accumulate savings.

The economy underwent an upturn in the 1960s, which led to the opening of several shopping centres.


## Shopping centres

Two of the first modern shopping centres were Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui and The Landmark in Central, above the MTR station. Daimaru led a trend of Japanese exports into Hong Kong in 1966 and Deng Xiaoping's 1978 Open Door Policy made Hong Kong the definitive gateway to China. As the economy improved during the 1970s and 80s, there was increasing demand for luxury goods, such as air conditioning.

In 1984, Cityplaza in Taikoo Shing was redeveloped. A large architectural project at the time was also undertaken to connect Ocean Centre to the Harbour City shopping mall in Tsim Sha Tsui. Many large shopping centres were also built in the new towns, including Tuen Mun Town Plaza, New Town Plaza, and Tai Po Mega Mall.

The large mall construction movement continued into the 1990s with Pacific Place, Dragon Centre, Time Square, Plaza Hollywood and Festival Walk. Developments further expanded into the New Territories.
