## History

It all began with Brother Reuben Akinwalere George (later Pastor (Dr) R. A. George), a member of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) and a leader of the Christ Army Band of the CAC. In 1956, they started first as a small fellowship and Bible Study Group led by George at his residence. The Church began to grow, and later moved to her first building and gradually spread. George was ordained as Pastor in 1959 and he died in 1987 after which his deputy Pastor (Dr) E.O. Abina took over the mantle of leadership. Pastor Elijah Ogundele Abina resigned his appointment in the secular work at Arbico Ltd. Apapa Lagos and took up pastoral duty as Pastor i/c of G.F.M. from Saturday 29 September 1962. On 22 December 1963, Pastor E.O. Abina was ordained as Pastor. The Gospel Faith Mission International became an incorporated body in Nigeria in October 1967. The first Annual Convention was held from 4 to 7 November 1966. Attendance then was 300 and there was free feeding for participants.
