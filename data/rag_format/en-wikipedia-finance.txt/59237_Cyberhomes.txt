# Cyberhomes



**Cyberhomes** is a real estate website owned by Fidelity National Financial and Lender Processing Services (LPS). It lists the most current sales of homes in a neighborhood by similar sales.


## History

In 1995 Moore Data Management Services created the website Cyberhomes.com. The site was set up with the goal of connecting homebuyers and sellers with real estate professionals.

In 1999 VistaInfo became interested in acquiring Moore's real estate businesses, including Cyberhomes.com. By December 1999, VistaInfo completed the purchase. At the time that move made VistaInfo the largest supplier of MLS information management systems in the countryâ€”serving over 100 MLS organizations and 350,000 real estate professionals.

In 2001 Fidelity National Financial and VistaInfo completed a merger forming a new company called Fidelity National Information Solutions (FNIS). Shortly after the merger in 2002, FNIS pulled the plug on Cyberhomes, but the URL was retained by a key executive.

In 2006 an entirely new product was born and took on the name Cyberhomes. It launched with access to Fidelity National Financials property information database and automated valuation tools.

In 2012, CyberHomes was purchased by Listingbook, LLC.
