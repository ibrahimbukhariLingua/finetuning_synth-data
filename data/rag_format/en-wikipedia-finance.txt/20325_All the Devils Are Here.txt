# All the Devils Are Here



***All the Devils Are Here: The Hidden History of the Financial Crisis*** is a nonfiction book by authors Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera about the 2008 financial crisis. It details how the financial crisis bubbled up from a volatile, and bipartisan, mixture of government meddling and *laissez-faire*. It concludes that the episode was not an accident, and that banks understood the big picture before the crisis happened but continued with bad practices nevertheless.


## The title

The title of the book comes from William Shakespeare's play *The Tempest*, in which he wrote "Hell is empty, and all the devils are here".
