Consco


# Consco



**Consco Enterprises Inc.** was a software development firm headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, United States, in the early to late 1980s.


## Products

Consco's primary product dubbed *Consolidation*, was based on pegboard accounting principles and designed to generate complex quarterly and annual tax reports for large multi-national corporations. Pegboard systems were and are still sold nationwide by "Control o fax" in Waterloo, Iowa.

The main *Consolidation* product was later packaged with other Consco financial applications, such as *Currency Conversion*, which added functionality. The package was named Accounting Information System, or AIS.


## Clients

Some AIS clients included the Ford Motor Company, Campbell Soup Company, Miles Laboratories, LTV Corporation, Owens-Illinois, Texaco, Pennzoil, The Tennessee Valley Authority and Cummins Engine Company.

Consco's shares were traded on NASDAQ under the symbol CNSO. An unrelated company, CNS Response, now uses that symbol. In 1988, the company sold its product line to Computer Associates. In May 1984, Seymour Altucher was the company's chairman.
