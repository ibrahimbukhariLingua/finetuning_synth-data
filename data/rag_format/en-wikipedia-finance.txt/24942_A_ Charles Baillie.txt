## Early life and education

Alexander Charles Baillie was born on December 20, 1939, the son of Dr Alexander Charles Baillie Sr. (1908–1998) and Jean Gibson (1906–2002). He grew up in Orillia, Ontario, and was educated at the University of Toronto Schools.

## Career

During his tenure as CEO, Baillie lead a failed attempt to merge with CIBC, but was later successful in acquiring Canada Trust. In his last year as CEO, the bank posted its first quarterly loss in fifteen years, largely attributed to lending activity in the telecommunications and cable television sectors that Baillie had pushed for in the late 1990's.
