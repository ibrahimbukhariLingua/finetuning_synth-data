Balt initially focused on plastic micro-tubes for the pharmaceutical industry. In 1987, it developed a microcatheter enabling the treatment of arteriovenous malformations. The Silk Vista Baby, one of the company's most recent innovations released in 2018, is the world's smallest collapsible intracranial stent.

Balt's revenues tripled between 2015 and 2020 and its workforce, quadrupled to reach 500 employees worldwide in 2020. Balt sells its production to 100 countries around the world. Between 2016 and 2019, the company acquired the American start-up Blockade Medical, which also produces medical devices, as well as several of its distributors in Europe, China, India and Brazil. Today, Balt operates in ten different geographical locations worldwide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
