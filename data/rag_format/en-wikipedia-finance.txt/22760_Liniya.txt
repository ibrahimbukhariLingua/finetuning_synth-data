## History

On December 6, 2002, the first store of the chain was opened in Kursk. This chain currently owns 27 stores (not counting stores in MegaGrinn shopping mall centers) in 10 oblasts of Russia.

In 2019, the media reported that allegedly 99.9% owned by JSC Corporation "Grinn" was pledged in favor of LLC "Strategy", which is managed by the relatives of one of the co-owners of the holding "Adamant". Nikolai Greshilov denied this information. Prior to this, information appeared that the Bryansk territory "Liniya" stores would be sold, as the company was allegedly preparing for bankruptcy.
