# Yury Chyzh



**Yury Chyzh** (Belarusian: Юрый Чыж, Russian: Юрий Чиж, **Yury Chizh**, born 1963) is a Belarusian businessman, believed to be one of the country's richest people. According to estimates, he is the second-wealthiest businessman in Belarus, the first being Vladimir Peftiev. On March 23, 2012, Chyzh was included in EU's travel ban list because of his alleged ties to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko.
