## History

University Bank was founded in 1890 as the Newberry Bank, the only bank in the Upper Peninsula town of Newberry, Michigan. In 1908, it received a bank charter from the state of Michigan and changed its name to the Newberry State Bank.

In 1988, the University Bancorp bank holding company owned by Stephen Lange Ranzini and Joseph Ranzini acquired controlling interest in the bank. Under Ranzini, the bank expanded into Sault Ste. Marie and doubled in size.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1994, Newberry State Bank sold its loans, deposits, and branches to another bank in the Upper Peninsula. Ranzini retained the bank charter, renamed it University Bank, and moved it to Ann Arbor, where there was only one other community bank serving a diverse, vibrant and growing community. A new management team was recruited and the bank opened in Ann Arbor in early 1996. After the initial management team was replaced, Ranzini took over the direct day-to-day management of the bank in late 1997.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2009, the FDIC and Michigan Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation sent a cease-and-desist order to University Bank to stop conducting business with SWIFT and requiring more liquidity. The order also noted that the bank lacked an effective system of controls to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act.
