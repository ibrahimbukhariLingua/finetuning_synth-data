County and City Enterprise Board


# County and City Enterprise Board



Ireland's **County & City Enterprise Boards** (**CCEB**s) ran from 1993 to 2014. They were established in 1993, as companies limited by guarantee, during a time of high unemployment (15.1%) and limited opportunity for business. They were given statutory status under the Industrial Development Act of 1995. The 35 boards were created to stimulate economic development and to cultivate an ethos of local entrepreneurship. They were dissolved by the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act 2014, and their functions transferred to Enterprise Ireland.


## Functions

The Enterprise Boards were established to "fill the gap in the support services for local enterprises" and to "develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small enterprises".

The primary goals of each enterprise board were designed to stimulate and promote local enterprise culture and entrepreneurship and to assist new business start ups, particularly through the provision of financial assistance.

The Irish economy has always relied heavily on its exports and in that respect, the County & City Enterprise Boards were intended to support those companies with a potential export capacity.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Once a company reached its export potential, Enterprise Ireland would incubate that company going forward. Ireland also depends on its indigenous small and medium enterprises, (SMEs) for internal economic growth. These companies were the primary target for CEB support.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Each board was made up of voluntary members representing the local council, local or national agencies and local community interests.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The boards employed a small number of staff who deliver board supports in the locality.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
