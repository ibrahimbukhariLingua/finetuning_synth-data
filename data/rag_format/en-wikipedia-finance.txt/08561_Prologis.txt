# Prologis



**Prologis, Inc.** is a real estate investment trust headquartered in San Francisco, California that invests in logistics facilities. The company was formed through the merger of AMB Property Corporation and Prologis in June 2011, which made Prologis the largest industrial real estate company in the world. As of December 2022, the company owned 5,495 buildings comprising about 1.2 billion square feet in 19 countries across North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. According to *The Economist*, its business strategy is focused on warehouses that are located close to huge urban areas where land is scarce. It serves about 6,600 tenants. Prologis began to expand its non-real estate business, Essentials, in 2022, offering customers solar power, racking systems, forklifts, generators, EV charging infrastructure, and other logistics tech equipment for purchase.


## History

AMB, the earliest predecessor of Prologis, was formed in 1984. In its present form, Prologis was created in 2011 through the merger of AMB and ProLogis, both multinational real estate companies based in the United States.


### 1983 founding and early history

In 1983, Hamid Moghadam and Doug Abbey used a $50,000 line of credit to found Abbey, Moghadam and Company, an investment manager serving institutions. They were joined by T. Robert Burke in 1984 and established AMB Property Corporation, which invested in office, industrial and community shopping centers on behalf of large institutional investors. During the savings and loan crisis, the company avoided significant financial repercussions by investing in industrial parks and shopping centers, and began to exit the office market in 1987. AMB launched its first private equity fund in 1989, which focused on industrial and retail properties.

In late 1997, AMB became a public company via an initial public offering, with more than US$2.8 billion under management.

In 1999, the company sold its retail business to focus solely on the industrial sector. The company made its first overseas investment in 2002, developing a facility for Procter & Gamble. That year, AMB initiated an international expansion program focused on buying and developing distribution facilities near global trade hubs, particularly in growth markets such as Brazil, Mexico, and China. AMB added an internal development division in 2004. By 2011, AMB was focusing on expanding its operations in China and Brazil.

Security Capital Industrial Trust (SCI), a legacy company of Prologis, was formed in 1991. Under the leadership of Dane Brooksher, SCI became a public company via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. The company first expanded outside the United States in 1996 with acquisitions in Mexico and in 1997 it acquired properties in both Mexico and Europe. SCI invested in the Netherlands in the summer of 1997 and then expanded into Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Warsaw, London, Berlin, Milan, and Madrid. SCI purchased 33% of Insight Inc. in October 1997 to help solve supply-chain problems for clients. SCI also expanded into the refrigerated distribution business in 1997, purchasing Christian Salvesen and renaming it CS Integrated LLC. SCI acquired Texas Cold Storage and Continental Freezer in 1997 and secured the primary contract to distribute food for Kroger Co. in Illinois. For refrigeration abroad, SCI purchased Frigoscandia AB, then Europe's largest distributor of refrigerated goods. SCI later exited the cold-storage business.


### 1997 incorporation and international expansion

Prologis, Inc. was incorporated on November 24, 1997. SCI officially changed its name to ProLogis in July 1998. SCI was active in 84 markets in 12 countries by July 1998, with a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.

Amid problems with debt following aggressive expansion and heavy borrowing, ProLogis' CEO Jeffrey Schwartz was replaced by Walter Rakowich in 2008. Rakowich afterward implemented a cost-cutting effort involving raising capital and selling assets. In December 2008, ProLogis sold a portfolio of assets to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, which subsequently transformed the assets into Global Logistic Properties.
