# Shenzhen Stock Exchange



The **Shenzhen Stock Exchange** (**SZSE**; Chinese: 深圳证券交易所) is a stock exchange based in the city of Shenzhen, in the People's Republic of China. It is one of three stock exchanges operating independently in Mainland China, the others being the Beijing Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It is situated in the Futian district of Shenzhen. The SZSE is the world's 6th largest stock exchange with a market capitalization exceeding US$4.4 trillion in July 2024.


## History

On 1 December 1990, Shenzhen Stock Exchange was founded. As an idea adapted from the capitalist countries, it was politically controversial in China.⁵⁶–⁵⁷ In support of the stock exchange, Deng Xiaoping rhetorically asked, "Are securities and the stock markets good or bad? Do they entail dangers? Are they peculiar to capitalism? Can socialism make use of them?"⁵⁷ Deng contended that China must try them out and reserve judgment, because if securities and the stock market went well, they could be expanded, and if not, they could be stopped.⁵⁷

In January 1992, Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour saved China's capital market and the two stock exchanges (the other was the Shanghai Stock Exchange).

Before 1997, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was under municipal control and termed an "experimental point".¹⁰²–¹⁰³

In July 1997, the State Council of China decided that the Shenzhen Stock Exchange would be directly managed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It also affirmed that China's stock exchanges had a legitimate role in the socialist market economy.¹⁰²

In 2004, the Small and Medium Enterprise Board was launched.¹⁶⁵

In October 2009, the ChiNext market (Chinese: 创业板) was inaugurated.¹⁶⁵


## Hours

The exchange has pre-market sessions from 09:15 am to 09:25 am and normal trading sessions from 09:30 am to 11:30 am and 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+08:00) on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.


## ChiNext

The exchange opened the ChiNext board (Chinese: 创业板), a NASDAQ-type exchange for high-growth, high-tech start-ups, on 23 October 2009.


### Overview

ChiNext is also called the second stock trading market. It refers to the securities trading market outside the main board. It provides growth space for small and medium-sized enterprises and emerging companies that cannot be listed in the main board. It is an effective supplement to the main board market. The biggest feature of the ChiNext is that it has low entry barriers and strict operation requirements, which help potential small and medium-sized enterprises obtain financing opportunities.

**History**

The establishment of the ChiNext was a response to the growing demand for alternative financing options for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China. Prior to its creation, many SMEs had difficulty raising capital as they did not meet the strict listing requirements of China's established stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

The ChiNext was launched with 28 listed companies and quickly gained attention from investors as a platform for investing in high-growth industries such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. Over time, the number of listed companies on the ChiNext has grown, and as of 2021, there are over 800 companies listed on the exchange.

In the years since its establishment, the ChiNext has undergone several reforms aimed at improving transparency, promoting more sustainable growth, and reducing risks associated with speculative trading. For example, in 2016, the exchange introduced a new registration-based IPO system, which simplified the listing process for new companies.


### Influences

The influences of ChiNext includes boosting innovation and entrepreneurship and attracting foreign investment. Specifically, ChiNext has played a key role in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in China by providing a platform for smaller and innovative companies to raise capital and grow their businesses. This has led to the development of startups and technology companies in China.
