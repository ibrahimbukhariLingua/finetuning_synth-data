Paisa


# Paisa



**Paisa** (also transliterated as *pice*, *pesa*, *poysha*, *poisha* and *baisa*) is a monetary unit in several countries. The word is also a generalised idiom for money and wealth. In India, Nepal, and Pakistan, the *paisa* currently equals 1⁄100 of a rupee. In Bangladesh, the *poysha* equals 1⁄100 of a Bangladeshi taka. In Oman, the *baisa* equals 1⁄1000 of an Omani rial.


## Etymology

The word *paisa* is from the Sanskrit term *padāṁśa* (पदांश, basic unit), meaning 'quarter part base', from *pada* (पद) "foot or quarter or base" and *aṁśa* (अंश) "part or unit". The pesa was also in use in colonial Kenya. The colloquial term for money in Burmese, *paiksan* (ပိုက်ဆံ), is derived from the Hindi term *paisa* (पैसा).


## History

Chaulukya coins were often called "Gadhaiya Paise" (9th–10th century CE). Until the 1950s in India and Pakistan (and before 1947 in British India), the paisa (back then spelled as *pice* in English) was equivalent to 3 pies, 1⁄4 of an anna, or 1⁄64 of a rupee. After the transition from a non-decimal currency to a decimal currency, the paisa equaled 1⁄100 of a rupee and was known as a *naya paisa* ("new paisa") for a few years to distinguish it from the old paisa(pice) that was 1⁄64 of a rupee.
