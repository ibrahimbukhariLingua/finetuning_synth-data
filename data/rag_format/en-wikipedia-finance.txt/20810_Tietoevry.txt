The customer base of the company grew during the 1970s, when mini-computers were introduced alongside the existing mainframe computers. Besides mainframe computer services and software, the development of IT systems was also central to the operations of Tietotehdas. Customers represented several industries and operations were organized according to these verticals. During the 1990s, the company experienced rapid growth through a number of acquisitions, mergers and strategic alliances. The company's name was changed from Tietotehdas to **TT Tieto** in 1995 and Tieto in 1998.

### Tieto Sweden

The current business activities in Sweden are undertaken by the subsidiary Tieto Sweden AB based on a restructuring of the former Enator corporation. Enator corporation started in 1977 as a consultant firm created to support the Pronator company with software and project management. In 1990, it merged with Modulföretagen, adopting its logo from Modul and name from Enator. Enator grew to approximately 650 consultants in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. In 1993, it was included in the AxData group as a stand-alone company but was sold to Celsius in 1995. The subsidiary's name, Enator, was applied to the whole group in 1995 when Celsius AB, a publicly traded Swedish company, merged the IT operations it had acquired between 1991 and 1994. Until 1994, there were IT operations in three separate subsidiaries: Telub, Enator and Dialog. The merger of the three subsidiaries led to a restructuring program in 1997. In spring 1996, the corporation was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the name of Enator.

During 1998, Enator conducted a series of acquisitions to strengthen the company's public sector exposure. The company acquired 51% of shares in the Stockholm-based consulting firm Programmera. In addition, the company acquired two small IT companies – Kvatro Telecom in Trondheim, Norway, and Soft Project in Hamburg, Germany – and divested from operations in Enator Telecom Mechanics. In April 1999, Enator acquired NetDesign in Denmark. After the Enator–Tieto merger in July 1999, the Enator brand was discontinued.

Kristina Westerlind, Head of Marketing and Communications at Tieto Sweden, commented on the incident to Dagens Nyheter: *"It is a hardware failure that is very difficult to predict at this time how long it takes to restore everything to normal. It can go fast or it could last a long time."* On 30 November, Tieto services for Apoteket e-prescriptions and SBAB were recovered and operational again. By 13 December, virtually all services were back to normal operations. Confidentiality agreements with customers prevented Tieto from revealing exactly who was affected by this incident. On 22 February 2012, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency published the report on *Reflections on community safety and preparedness for serious IT incidents* In March 2012, Tieto released a report investigating the incident.
