Two of Bear Stearns' hedge funds, the "High-Grade Structured Credit Fund" and the High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund, collapsed in June 2007, requiring bail out, and putting Marin at the center of the news. On June 22, 2007, Bear Stearns pledged a collateralized loan of up to $3.2 billion to bail out the High-Grade Structured Credit Fund. While covering the story. The New York Times, discovered that Marin had a blog, entitled "Whim of Iron," and on June 28, 2007 published what Marin had posted there. The blog had mostly innocuous entries, chiefly concerning his critiques of movies, his travel to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, and how he lost weight after bariatric surgery. It also stated that in dealing with the crisis over Bear Stearns' hedge funds he felt like Leonidas and the Spartans fighting off the Persians in 300. Twenty-four hours later Marin was relieved from his major duties at Bear Stearns and shunted aside to a job as an adviser.

Marin's blog was accessible on June 28, 2007. As of June 29, 2007 it ceased to be accessible to the general public, but many of its entries can be read through caches.

After a several year absence, Marin has returned to the world of blogging with a new venture. The site follows his earlier efforts in reviewing theatrical films, only this time with a slant towards the world of hedge funds.
