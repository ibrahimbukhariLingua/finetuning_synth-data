## Controversy

In a September 2007 review of Ayres's book *Super Crunchers*, the *New York Times'* David Leonhardt wrote that he "came across two sentences about a doctor in Atlanta that were nearly identical to two sentences I wrote in this newspaper last year." Leonhardt was particularly disturbed that "many readers will surely assume that Ayres witnessed some events" that Ayres did not.

On October 4, the *Yale Daily News* reported that it had found nine passages in the book, some more than a couple paragraphs long, that were identical or similar to those in the *Times* and four other publications. In reference to Ayres's case and a similar one in Illinois, George Washington University professor of English Margaret Soltan wrote in *Inside Higher Ed*: "Both men simply stuck passages from other writers into their text when it suited them, and gave either minimal or no attribution. In some of the passages in question, neither used quotation marks, even when they quoted at length, verbatim."

After some controversy over three weeks, Ayres apologized and said: "in several brief instances in the book, my language is too close to the sourced material and I should have used quotation marks to set it apart from my text." However, *The Chronicle of Higher Education* noted that Ayres insisted: "his citations are proper for a book intended for a popular audience but that he will make changes in future printings of the book." Critics were not satisfied with Ayres's explanation that they had simply made a mistake nor did critics accept that these practices were acceptable in popular books. *Inside Higher Ed* noted that the same behavior by students is "severely sanctioned." Professors at other universities were quite critical of Ayres's explanation and pointed out that the method used by the Yale Daily News to discover plagiarized passages was unlikely to catch them all.


## Personal life

Ayres married Jennifer Gerarda Brown, Dean Emerita of the Quinnipiac University School of Law, in 1993. They have two kids. They support various gay rights and marriage equality causes, including Freedom to Marry.
