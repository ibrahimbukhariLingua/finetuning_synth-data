## Home mortgage interest rate proposal

In October 2008, Mayer introduced a proposal with colleague Glenn Hubbard to ameliorate the effects of the Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 by offering home owners the opportunity to refinance their home mortgage at an interest rate of 5.25%. (By December, they had adjusted the proposed rate down to 4.5%.)
Mayer and Hubbard argued that the opportunity to refinance household debt at a low rate would improve both household and financial institution balance sheets which would then result in increased investment and consumer spending, mitigating the extent of the financial crisis. The proposal was subsequently debated in *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, NPR, and Bloomberg News. On December 12, 2008, Bloomberg News reported that President-Elect Barack Obama's economic team had expressed interest in the plan and White House economic chief Lawrence Summers had attempted to flesh out the details of the plan with Mayer and Hubbard.
