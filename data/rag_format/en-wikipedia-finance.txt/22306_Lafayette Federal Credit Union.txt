# Lafayette Federal Credit Union



**Lafayette Federal Credit Union** (**Lafayette Federal**), is a credit union headquartered at the Norman Cohen Financial Service Center in Rockville, Maryland, chartered and regulated under the authority of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) of the U.S. Federal government. As of November 2024, Lafayette Federal had over US$2.03 billion in assets, and over 57,600 members.


## History

On October 3, 1935, 1825 H Street Federal Credit Union was established and officially opened its doors in the heart of Washington, DC. The credit union was created to serve the employees of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the RFC Mortgage Company and the Commodity Credit Corporation. For the first few years, personal loans up to $50 (or $1,000 at today’s value) were the sole product offering. By 1939, the maximum limit on the loans was increased to $100 (or $2,000 at today’s value), and vehicle loans were also added as a second loan type.

In 1940, the credit union moved across town in Washington, DC, from its original H Street location to the Lafayette Building on Vermont Avenue in Northwest, and officially changed its name to Lafayette Federal Credit Union. During the 1940s, Lafayette Federal expanded its products and services to include share accounts and U.S. Savings Bonds. Staffing increased to six employees (five full-time and one part-time).

By the early 1950s, Lafayette Federal had reached 960 members, $129,000 in total loans outstanding, and assets of nearly $500,000. Additionally, the Small Business Administration was added to the field of membership.

Lafayette Federal experienced further growth during the 1960-70s time period. The credit union moved its headquarter location to the U.S. Department of State Building and added the U.S. Peace Corps as yet another organization within its field of membership. By 1970, the National Credit Union Administration was formed as the official entity to supervise and regulate credit unions. As a result of this, the “once a member, always a member” policy is adopted. By 1974, Lafayette Federal reached $10 million in assets and had 7,600 members.

The 1980s led to the launch of several new products and services to the credit union. Share draft, certificate, and IRA accounts, as well as first trust mortgage and home equity loans, were rolled out to the membership. Additionally, Lafayette Federal began offering ATM cards, paving the way for increased accessibility. In 1989, the credit union moved its headquarter location to a larger location in Kensington, Maryland.

In 1992, Lafayette Federal completed its first merger with Potomac Community Federal Credit Union. Following this, the credit union made major technological strides with the rollout of several new electronic services, including: telephone bill pay system, 24-hour telephone loan application service, access debit card, online banking system and the inaugural website. Lafayette Federal was one of the first financial institutions in the market to offer online banking services to its membership.

The early 2000s brought about the start of several new partnerships. Lafayette Federal teamed up with other credit unions to form Potomac Business Services, LLC in order to provide commercial loans to growing businesses. A couple of years later, commercial accounts and relationship checking accounts are introduced, offering more deposit options for both consumers and businesses. In 2008, Lafayette Federal hosts its very first Capitol Classic Charity Golf Tournament, thus commencing an annual charity event for the credit union.

In 2010, the credit union celebrated its 75 year anniversary. Over the next two years, membership eligibility is once again expanded with through the addition of the American Consumer Council (ACC). Through this organization, all residents of Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia are eligible to join. In 2016, Lafayette Federal completed its second merger with CSC Employees Federal Credit Union (still operating as Lafayette Federal Credit Union). The following year, the credit union moved its headquarters to Rockville, MD, and opened a branch on the premises a year later.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a landmark year worldwide. Lafayette Federal was able to shift gears to accommodate the new landscape. During this time, Lafayette Federal was able to maintain operations and continued to experience membership and loan growth. Following the credit union philosophy of “people helping people”, the credit union launched several initiatives aimed at aiding those at the frontline of the pandemic. With its Fuel the Frontline initiative, Lafayette Federal donated 1,755 meals to first responders and $850 in gift cards to Fox 5 DC's Hometown Heroes during the pandemic. Their performance was recognized by S&P Global by ranking #20 in their Top 100 Performing Credit Unions of 2020 Report. One year later, the credit union once again received national recognition as one of Newsweek’s America’s Best Banks for 2022. By March 31, 2021, Lafayette Federal reached a milestone $1 billion in assets. Later that year, the credit union raised an impressive $65,000 for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, totaling $1 million in charitable donations over the lifetime of the organization's fundraising efforts.

In 2023, Lafayette Federal relocated its McLean Financial Service Center from 6701 Lowell Avenue, McLean, VA 22101, to a new, renovated building at 6890 Elm Street, McLean, VA 22101. A grand opening celebration was hosted on Wednesday, October 11, 2023 to commemorate the new branch opening.
