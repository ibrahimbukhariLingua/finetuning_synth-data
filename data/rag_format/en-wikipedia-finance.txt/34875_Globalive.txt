WIND Mobile made a bid of $442m (CAD) to secure the wireless spectrum required for the launch of the WIND Mobile network in Canada, with the backing of Egypt's Orascom Telecom. Globalive subsequently made its first purchase in Industry Canadian radio spectrum auction, setting the stage for a new national cell phone network in Canada.
