Duisenberg School of Finance


# Duisenberg School of Finance



The **Duisenberg School of Finance** (**DSF**) was an educational university in the Netherlands. It offered Master's level education in finance between 2008 and 2015. The school was launched as a collaboration between the Dutch financial sector and various academic institutions. DSF's founders include influential Dutch economist Nout Wellink and Minister of Economic Affairs, Maria van der Hoeven. The name was chosen by the founders to honor Wim Duisenberg, the first President of the European Central Bank.Â 

In its first academic year, the school enrolled approximately one hundred students. The school had an administrative staff of eighteen faculty members supported by a number of partnering institutions, including the Dutch Central Bank, ING and APG. The university and its campus were located in the Symphony offices in the Amsterdam financial district of Zuidas. The board of directors and the executive fellowship at DSF included senior members of large financial institutions in the Netherlands.

In 2015, the Dutch Center for Higher Education Information (Dutch: *Centrum Hoger Onderwijs Informatie*) ranked the LLM Finance and Law programme as the highest ranking professional program in the Netherlands.

In fall of 2015, Duisenberg School of Finance was integrated into the programs of the Vrije Universiteit and University of Amsterdam. The program was renamed the Duisenberg Honors Program at VU and UVA.


## Program

The school offered a Masters of Science in four major tracks. The most intensive track was an LLM program in Finance, the other tracks being Risk Management, Financial Markets & Regulation, and Corporate Finance & Banking. Both the MS and LLM programmes of DSF were accredited by the NVAO (Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders).


## Background

DSF was founded as a collaborative effort of academic researchers, financial companies, legal firms and government organizations on September 7, 2008. The launch followed an agreement to finance the school operations signed by various Dutch financial service providers. The executive management and associated fellowship of DSF were composed of representatives from businesses, government, academia, and legal firms.


### Academic profile

Courses were typically taught by visiting faculty members. Academics from the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Vrije Universiteit (VU) often collaborated on various research projects with members of involved financial companies. Occasionally, lectures were taught by executive management of partnering financial institutions.

DSF Policy Briefs were designed together with regulators, members of the financial sector, and policymakers. Articles and research papers that met the school research criteria were published in the public domain. Students and faculty mainly worked on research papers aimed at assessing the regulation and efficiency of the financial sector. The Tinbergen Institute also worked together with DSF on research projects.

The coursework normally included an internship in finance or a related field, generally with one of the partnering institutions.

The Higher School of Economics had a dual-Masters agreement with DSF and annually 5-10% of the student body was from Russia. Other students came from India, China, Africa, Indonesia, USA, and Latin America. Students from The Netherlands represented around 30-35% of the student body.
