In April 2010, the airline revealed plans to launch a new subsidiary dedicated to commercial scheduled and charter passenger services to complement its existing corporate service business.
In July 2010 the company selected the Bombardier Q400 over the ATR 72-500 after evaluating both sixty- to seventy-seater aircraft. The company ordered 5 aircraft (2 firm and 3 options) in August 2010. The first 2 aircraft have been delivered in late 2010.
