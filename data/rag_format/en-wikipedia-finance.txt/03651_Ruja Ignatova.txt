Ruja Ignatova


# Ruja Ignatova



**Ruja Plamenova Ignatova** (Bulgarian: Ружа Пламенова Игнатова, romanized: *Ruža Plamenova Ignatova*, occasionally transliterated as "Ruga Ignatova"; born May 30, 1980 – disappeared October 25, 2017) is a Bulgarian-born German entrepreneur best known as one of the FBI’s Top Ten wanted Fugitives, and as the founder of a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme known as OneCoin, which *The Times* described as "one of the biggest scams in history." She was the subject of the 2019 BBC podcast series *The Missing Cryptoqueen* and the 2022 book of the same name. Ignatova boarded a Ryanair flight to Athens on October 25, 2017, and has not been seen since.

Since her disappearance, Ignatova has long been presumed to be on the run from various international law enforcement agencies. The FBI has offered up to five million dollars for any information leading to her arrest. In early 2019, she was charged *in absentia* by U.S. authorities for wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering. She was added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted in June 2022. Ignatova is the subject of an Interpol warrant issued by German authorities.

Reporting in 2023 and 2024 suggested that Ignatova may have been murdered in 2018 on the orders of Bulgarian organised crime figure "Taki" Hristoforos Nikos Amanatidis, who is suspected of initially sheltering her.


## Early life and education

Ignatova was born in Ruse, Bulgaria in 1980 to a Romani family. Ignatova emigrated to Germany with her family when she was ten years old, and spent part of her childhood in Schramberg in the state of Baden-Württemberg. In 2005, she earned a PhD in private international law from the University of Konstanz in Germany with the dissertation *Art. 5 Nr. 1 EuGVO – Chancen und Perspektiven der Reform des Gerichtsstands am Erfüllungsort*, which discusses *lex causae* in conflict of laws. She reportedly also worked for McKinsey & Company.


## Criminal activities

In 2012, she was convicted of fraud in Germany in connection with her father Plamen Ignatov's acquisition of a company that shortly afterwards was declared bankrupt in dubious circumstances; she was given a suspended sentence of 14 months' imprisonment. In 2013, she was involved with a multi-level marketing scam called BigCoin. In 2014, she founded a pyramid scheme called OneCoin.


## Investigation and disappearance

On October 25, 2017, Ignatova traveled from Bulgaria to Athens, then disappeared after she may have been tipped off about increasing police investigations into OneCoin. In 2019, her brother Konstantin Ignatov pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering in connection with the scheme.

In 2022, prosecutors in Darmstadt, Germany confirmed an investigation of "a lawyer from Neu-Isenburg" for possible money laundering: the transfer of 7.69 million euros by Ignatova into one of her private accounts in 2016. In January 2022, police searched apartments and offices in Weilburg, Baden-Baden, Frankfurt am Main, Bad Homburg, Neu-Isenburg and Vaihingen.

Afterwards, the North Rhine-Westphalia Police and German Federal Criminal Police Office announced that Ignatova is sought for fraud charges. The Federal Criminal Police Office announced a €5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. An Interpol Red Notice followed. This listing was reciprocated by Europol adding Ignatova to its 'most wanted' list; however, Deutsche Welle notes that the Europol listing was removed under unknown circumstances.

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation added Ignatova to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, replacing Octaviano Juarez-Corro, and announced at a joint press conference with IRS Criminal Investigation and United States Attorney's Office Southern District of New York. The FBI followed up with an episode of its podcast and YouTube series *Inside the FBI* devoted to Ignatova and the OneCoin case. As of May 2022, there was a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading to Ignatova's arrest; in June 2024, the reward was increased to $5,000,000. In August 2024, a "UK court ordered a global asset freeze for [Ignatova] and her OneCoin associates".

While a 2022 interview with FBI Special Agent Paul Roberts noted that the agency's investigation into Ignatova was "operating under the assumption that she is still alive" and that the agency had "no information" to counter that belief, Bulgarian investigative reporting site Bureau of Investigative Reporting and Data – BIRD published a 2023 report on Bulgarian police documents in which a police informant had overheard Georgi Vasilev, the brother-in-law of the Bulgarian drug lord "Taki" Hristoforos Amanatidis, saying (in an intoxicated state) that Ignatova was murdered in November 2018 on Taki's orders. The alleged murderer, Hristo Hristov, who is also Bulgarian, is serving a sentence in a Dutch prison for drug trafficking. According to the report, Ignatova was murdered aboard a yacht in the Ionian Sea, and her body was dismembered and thrown overboard. The alleged motive for the murder was to conceal Taki's involvement in the OneCoin scam.

Ignatova was the subject of a book, *The Missing Cryptoqueen*, in 2022.


## Personal life

Ignatova was married to the German lawyer Björn Strehl, with whom she has a daughter in 2016.
