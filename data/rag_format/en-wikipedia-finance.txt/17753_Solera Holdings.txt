In April 2006, Solera and private equity firm GTCR announced the completion of their acquisition of the Claims Services Group of Automatic Data Processing (NYSE: ADP) for $975 million in cash.

In May 2007, Solera completed an IPO, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SLH".

In September 2015, Solera announced an agreement to be acquired by Vista Equity Partners, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, and other affiliated investors for approximately $6.5 billion. The transaction was completed in March 2016.

In July 2016, Solera announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Enservio, Inc, a Massachusetts-based company that provides software and services to the property contents insurance marketplace.
