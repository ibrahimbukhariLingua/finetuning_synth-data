## History

The Guinness Trust was founded in 1890 by the then Edward Cecil Guinness, a great-grandson of the founder of the Guinness Brewery, to help homeless people in London and Dublin. Edward Cecil Guinness was created the 1st Baron Iveagh in 1891, the 1st Viscount Iveagh in 1905, and the 1st Earl of Iveagh in 1919. Lord Iveagh, as he became, donated £200,000 to set up the Guinness Trust in London, the equivalent of £25 million in today's money.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Iveagh Trust based in Dublin took responsibility for Ireland. The Guinness Trust extended its objectives outside London in 1962, eventually operating in all parts of England. It was not related to the brewery company. The history of its first century was published by Peter Malpass in 1998.

In 1992, the Guinness Trust Group acquired the Parchment Group, parent company of Hermitage Housing Association. The combined group is now known as The Guinness Partnership. Northern Counties Housing Association joined the Partnership in 2008.

In 2022, Guinness Partnership announced that it has joined the G15 group of large housing associations in London, the body which aims to provide a collective voice for large, registered housing providers in the capital.


## Structure

In 2012, the housing properties and operations of The Guinness Trust were combined with those of the other main housing divisions in the Group to form a single charitable company operating nationwide, The Guinness Partnership Limited.

The Guinness Partnership and Wulvern Housing Limited merged on 31 January 2017.

The sales and marketing team is responsible for the sales of the Partnership's shared ownership and market sale properties across England. They are known as Guinness Homes and have a separate website to the Partnership's main website.
