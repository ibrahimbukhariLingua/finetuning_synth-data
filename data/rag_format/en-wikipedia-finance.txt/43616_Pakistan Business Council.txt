**Objectives of the PBC:**

The major objectives of the PBC as stated in its founding documents are:

* To provide for the formation and exchange of views on any question connected with the conduct of businesses in and from Pakistan.

* To interact with Governments in the economic development of Pakistan and to facilitate, foster and further the economic, social and human resource development of Pakistan.
