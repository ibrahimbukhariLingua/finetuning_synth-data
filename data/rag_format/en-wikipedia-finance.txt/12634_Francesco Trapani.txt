### Bulgari sale to LVMH

Trapani described in a 2004 article that "one day, Bulgari is going to be sold, we'll see." He also described that "there are a couple of big companies that would be interested, but they have not approached us."

Regarding the sale of Bulgari to LVMH in March 2011, he indicated that the sale is because LVMH recognises Bulgari as a "star brand" and that he doesn't believe LVMH will "dilute" the brand.
