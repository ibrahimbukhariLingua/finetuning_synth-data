## History

*Wirtschaftsdienst* was established in 1916 at the Hamburg Institute of International Economics (HWWA) in collaboration with the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the University of Kiel. In 2007, the HWWA was merged with the ZBW with the aim of making the journal a leading forum for research-based discussions of major German and European economic policy issues.
