**Banktivity** (formerly known as iBank) is a personal finance management suite designed for macOS and iOS platforms by IGG Software and debuted in 2003 as a Mac desktop software.


## History

There have been a total of 8 releases for the desktop version since its inception. Over this same period, IGG Software Inc. also released iOS versions for the iPhone (2009), the iPad (2012), and Apple Watch. Features differ between the apps, specifically the lack of reporting on the iPhone version.

*Macworld* compared iBank 2 to Quicken, but "with a decidedly Mac-like interface". iBank 3 was updated for Mac OS X Leopard, with support for Cover Flow, Quick Look, and Core Animation. It also integrates with other Apple Inc. products, such as syncing with an iPhone via MobileMe. iBank 3.4 improved support for Quicken import.

iBank 4 was updated to be compatible with Mac OS X 10.7. Some iBank 4 features included Direct Connect (downloads from online accounts), iPhone sync, MobileMe compatibility, interactive charts, multiple currencies, a budget monitor, check printing, loan and portfolio management, smart accounts, TurboTax exporting, and Quicken importing.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Banktivity 5 was released on January 28, 2016. After nearly 13 years, IGG retired the iBank name, announcing Banktivity as the successor of the IGG's personal finance software line.

## Reception
