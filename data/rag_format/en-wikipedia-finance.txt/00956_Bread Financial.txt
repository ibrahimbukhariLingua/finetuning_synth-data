Bread Financial


# Bread Financial



**Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.** is an American publicly-traded provider of private label credit cards, coalition loyalty programs, and direct marketing, derived from the capture and analysis of transaction-rich data.

A significant portion of Bread Financial's revenue is generated through late fees charged to the subprime consumers it primarily serves. In October 2024 the *Wall Street Journal* reported that Bread Financial would raise its soft interest rate of 29.99% and add additional fees to customer accounts in anticipation of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ruling that would reduce its $41.00 late payment fee to $8.00.


## History

Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of two entities: J.C. Penney's credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation, named World Financial Network National Bank.

In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired LoyaltyOne, then-branded The Loyalty Group Canada, for $250 million. The deal gave Alliance Data two business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne.

In 2001, Alliance Data went public.

In May 2007, The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, announced plans to acquire Alliance Data. In April 2008, Alliance Data terminated the merger agreement with Blackstone Affiliates.

Ed Heffernan was promoted to president and CEO of Alliance Data in February 2009, after being with the company since 1998. In 2019 he resigned as CEO of Alliance Data and was replaced by Melisa Miller, who previously ran Alliance Data's Card Services division. This change in leadership effectively moved Alliance Data's Headquarters from Plano, Texas, to Columbus, Ohio. Melisa Miller held the role for about 6 months before being replaced by former CITI executive Ralph Andretta.

In 2019, Alliance Data opened its first international office in Bangalore, India.

In November 2021, Alliance Data completed the separation of its LoyaltyOne segment, consisting of the Canadian AIR MILES Reward Program and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty businesses, into an independent, publicly traded company, Loyalty Ventures Inc. In March 2022, Alliance Data rebranded as Bread Financial.

Five businesses make up the LoyaltyOne: Air Miles national reward program, in which approximately two-thirds of Canadian households participate; Colloquy; LoyaltyOne Consulting; Precima; and Squareknot.


### Epsilon (aka Epsilon Data Management)

Epsilon provides a broad range of loyalty marketing services spanning database marketing, direct mail, email marketing, web development, loyalty programs, analytics, data services, strategic consulting, and creative services, among others. It sends billions of permission-based emails every year. Acquired by Epsilon in 2011, Aspen Marketing Services is a marketing services agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. In 2012, Epsilon reached an agreement to acquire the Hyper Marketing ("HMI") group of companies, the largest privately held digital marketing services agencies in the United States, for about $460 million. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In late February 2013, Facebook announced partnerships with four companies, including Epsilon, to help reshape its targeted advertising strategy.

The company relocated its headquarters to the former Nokia regional headquarters space in Las Colinas, Texas, near Dallas.

In April 2019, Publicis Groupe announced it would be acquiring Epsilon for $4.4 billion. This was the second biggest deal in the history of advertising, behind only Dentsu's $5 billion acquisition of Aegis Group in 2012.

On January 27, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice entered a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with Epsilon Data Management, which set up a $127.5 million fund to compensate victims.


## Controversy

In 2010 Epsilon failed to heed warnings to secure data. In March 2011 it was discovered that email addresses from customers of at least 50 client companies were stolen. A phishing tactic that uses personalized emails to trick people into disclosing personal information, including passwords and financial details, it was reported that the breach was related to Epsilon itself being phished. The company quickly notified the public about the breach. In June 2011 company executives were called before Congress to answer questions about the security breach. Interviewed for a *60 Minutes* segment titled "The Data Brokers: Selling your personal information", then-CEO and chairman Bryan Kennedy called the hearings "political theater" and stated that "consumers ought to understand that the Internet is an advertising medium."


## Products and Technology

In October 2020, Alliance Data launched Enhanced Digital Suite.

In October 2020, Alliance Data selected Fiserv for Credit Processing Services.

In 2021, Alliance Data invested $100M in digital technologies.
