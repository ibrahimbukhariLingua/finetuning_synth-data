In case of death or full disability, the payment to the nominee will be ₹2 Lakh and in case of partial permanent disability it would be ₹1 Lakh. Full disability has been defined as loss of use in both eyes, hands, or feet. Partial Permanent disability has been defined as loss of use in one eye, hand, or foot. Further, death due to suicide, alcohol, drug abuse, etc., are not covered. A person joined under this scheme is eligible for a claim only after 45 days of joining the scheme.

This scheme is linked to the bank accounts opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme. Most of these accounts had zero balance initially. The government aims to reduce the number of such zero balance accounts by using this and related schemes. Now, all bank account holders can avail this facility through their net-banking service facility at any time of the year. The policy will be canceled if there is no balance in the account. The policy will lapse in case the bank account is closed. If you have multiple bank accounts, only one bank account can be linked to the scheme.

## Criticism

A rising loss ratio has forced general insurers to urge the government to hike the premium for the scheme.


## Results

As of 31 March 2019, 15.47 crore people have already enrolled for this scheme. 32,176 claims have been disbursed amounting to ₹643.52 crore (US$74 million).

In April 2017, Haryana Government announced that all Haryana residents in the age group of 18–70 years will be covered by PMSBY; the state government would reimburse the premium to the beneficiary.
