# Opinary



**Opinary GmbH** (formerly Pressekompass, founded in 2013) is a tech-media company based in Berlin-Kreuzberg. It was founded in 2016 by siblings Pia Frey, Cornelius Frey, and Max Meran. The company is best known for its gauge survey tool, visualizing debates using a gauge graphic. This tool reaches 120 million users monthly and is regularly featured in German popular culture, such as the ZDF Magazin Royale.

To engage and identify readership, Opinary integrates surveys into online articles primarily within German-speaking mainstream media and news portals, including FAZ, Spiegel, and Focus Online. The company generates revenue by displaying advertisements after surveys, promising brands that their ads will be placed where user interest already exists. Opinary's surveys are not representative but are used as a marketing tool.

Opinary integrates three different tools into online articles primarily within German-speaking mainstream media and news portals, including FAZ, Spiegel, and Focus Online, intending to engage and identify readership.

Opinary has closed a €3 million funding round with operational VC Project A. Existing investors Global Founders Capital, Motu Ventures, and several business angels like Rolf Schrömgens (CEO, Trivago), have also participated in the round.


## Major Controversies

In 2018, Opinary surveys were criticized for being perceived as representative, thereby creating misleading assumptions about public opinion on news-related debates. Sascha Hölig from the Hans-Bredow-Institut commented on this issue, saying, "The informational value of these surveys is comparable to the horoscope in a magazine... The question framing in Opinary's gauge surveys is problematic. In most cases, the tool provides not only two preset answers but also links them with explanations." Particularly on the internet, those who voice their opinions or vote are often individuals with more extreme views.

Many online media outlets use Opinary surveys to gauge the mood of their readership on various topics. In early 2022, Opinary surveys faced criticism when opponents of COVID-19 vaccinations on platforms like Facebook and Telegram urged others to participate in surveys about vaccination mandates to skew the results in their favor. According to Tagesschau, up to 500,000 users saw these calls daily. Opinary co-founder Pia Frey stated in an interview with Tagesschau that Opinary employs a system to detect bot-driven manipulation and has filters to prevent manipulation by interest groups.


## Acquisition

In July 2023, Opinary was acquired by Affinity, a multinational ad-tech company. The acquisition was funded through a mix of equity and cash.
