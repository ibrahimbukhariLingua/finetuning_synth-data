### Utah State Senate


#### 2008 election

In 2008, incumbent state Senator Dan Eastman did not file for re-election. Eight Davis county Republicans filed to take his place. At the 2008 Davis county Republican convention, Liljenquist received 55% of the delegate vote. In the ensuing primary with Ron Mortensen, Liljenquist won 64% of the vote to Mortensen's 36%.

In the November general election, he received 70.40% of the vote to Democrat Richard Watson's 26.2% and Constitution Party candidate Jorgina Hancock's 3.3%.


#### Tenure

In his freshman year in the Utah Senate, Liljenquist sponsored SB 126: State Personnel Management Act Amendments that put performance over length of service when considering rehiring public employees, effectively eliminating tenure.

In 2010, Liljenquist addressed pension reform with SB 63, moving Utah to a defined contribution state maxing out at 10%. Spurred by a 30% loss to the state retirement fund in 2008, Liljenquist focused on changing the system for new hires entering after July 1, 2011, moving away from a defined benefit program to a defined contribution plan. He also successfully sponsored a companion bill, SB 43 that did away with the so-called practice of "double-dipping." His bill also eliminated pensions for state legislators.

In 2011, Liljenquist was the sponsor of Utah's Medicaid reform. SB 180, which passed unanimously, proposed block granting Medicaid funds to Utah, switching from a fee-for-service model to a managed care system, and making Utah the first state in the nation to cap Medicaid growth. The reforms were estimated to save $2.5 billion on total funds in the first seven years of its implementation.

During his tenure in the State Senate, Liljenquist served on the Appropriations, Standing, and Interim committee.

*Governing Magazine* named him a 2011 "Public Official of the Year" for his work on both pension and Medicaid reform. FreedomWorks named him their "Legislative Entrepreneur of the Year" in November 2011.

On December 15, 2011, Liljenquist resigned from the Utah State Senate.
