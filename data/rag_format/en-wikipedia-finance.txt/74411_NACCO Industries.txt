## History

NACCO Industries originated in 1913 with the incorporation of the Cleveland and Western Coal Company. The name was changed to The **N**orth **A**merican **C**oal **Co**rporation (NACCO) in 1925, and the company operated exclusively in the coal industry until the acquisition of Yale Materials Handling Corporation in 1985. This was followed in 1986 by creation of the holding company under the name NACCO Industries, Inc. NACCO Industries expanded into housewares with the purchase of Proctor Silex in 1988 and Hamilton Beach in 1990, and expanded its presence in the materials handling industry by adding the Hyster Company in 1989. Yale Materials Handling Corporation and the Hyster Company were combined to form Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, which was spun off in 2012. In 2017, NACCO spun off Hamilton Beach Brands and Kitchen Collections.
