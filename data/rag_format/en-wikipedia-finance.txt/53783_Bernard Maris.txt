## Work in economics

Maris was a great admirer of John Maynard Keynes, to whom he dedicated a book, *Keynes ou l'économiste citoyen*, and has published many popular economic books. He is known, amongst others, by titles such as *Ah Dieu! Que la guerre économique est jolie!* (1998), *Lettre ouverte aux gourous de l'économie qui nous prennent pour des imbéciles* (1999) and *La Bourse ou la vie* (2000).

With incisive style, he tried to explain the nature and the interests of the real economy, unveiling its negative aspects, but also highlighting concepts and alternatives such as the gratuity, the gift economy and basic income, which were, in his eyes, of significance.

*Le Nouvel Économiste* magazine assigned him the title of "Best Economist of the Year", in 1995.
