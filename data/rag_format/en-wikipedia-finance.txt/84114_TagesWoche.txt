# TagesWoche



***TagesWoche*** is a Swiss German-language online newspaper, with a weekly Friday printed edition, published in Basel, Switzerland by Neue Medien Basel AG.


## History

The newspaper's first edition appeared on 28 October 2011. It was created in reaction to the events surrounding *Basler Zeitung*, the traditional daily newspaper of Basel, which had financial problems and was finally sold in November 2010.

Its editors-in-chief were Urs Buess and Remo Leupin, who led a staff of seventeen people, many of whom were formerly journalists at *Basler Zeitung*. On 17 May 2013, a new editor-in-chief was appointed: Dani Winter.
