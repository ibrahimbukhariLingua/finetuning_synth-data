In August 2012, the company placed one of the largest-ever helicopter orders: 22 aircraft for $682 million, primarily to serve the petroleum industry.

In June 2015, the company was acquired by GE Capital Aviation Services for $1.775 billion plus the assumption or payoff of Milestoneâ€™s existing debt.

In November 2021, GE Capital Aviation Services was acquired by AerCap.
