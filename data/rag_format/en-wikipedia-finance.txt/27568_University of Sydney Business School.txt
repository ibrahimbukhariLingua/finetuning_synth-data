University of Sydney Business School


# University of Sydney Business School



The **University of Sydney Business School** is the business school and a constituent body of the University of Sydney. It was established in January 2011 and formed from the School of Business within the previous Faculty of Economics and Business. The former combined faculty itself descended from the original Faculty of Economics founded in 1920, which was the first faculty of its kind in Australia.

The School is the first in Australia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) from the European Foundation for Management Development. The School was awarded AMBA accreditation in December 2019 and thus joined the prestigious global club of Triple Accredited business schools. It is also the only Australian business school to become an associate member of the Global Alliance in Management Education (CEMS).


## History

Established in 1920, the Faculty of Economics initially offered the Bachelor of Economics degree which commenced in 1914. The postgraduate Master of Economics degree commenced in 1925. In 1985, the faculty introduced its second undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs, the Bachelor of Economic and Social Sciences and the Master of Economic and Social Sciences, respectively. In 1993 its third undergraduate degree program, the Bachelor of Commerce, was introduced. The Master of International Studies followed in 1994, the Master of Commerce in 1995 and the Master of International Business in 1999.

In 2005 the Business School ended its association with the jointly run Australian Graduate School of Management with The University of New South Wales. From 2006 to 2007, the University conducted a review of its social sciences faculties. As a result of that review, it was determined that parts of the School of Economics within the Faculty of Economics and Business were to be transferred to the Faculty of Arts (as it then was). In January 2008, the disciplines of Government & International Relations and Political Economy were transferred to the Faculty of Arts.

In January 2011, the Discipline of Economics, the Centre for International Security Studies and the Graduate School of Government were also transferred to the Faculty of Arts, which was renamed the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Concurrently, the remaining disciplines of the Faculty of Economics and Business formed the University of Sydney Business School.

On 30 July 2009, the Business School announced the launch of the Global Executive MBA program, which was commenced in February 2010. On 30 July 2012, the Business School announced the introduction of the Sydney Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, with the program starting February 2013. Particular emphasis has been put into making positioning it as an internationally recognised degree.

In 2013, the purpose-fitted CBD campus, providing a central location for participants in the part-time MBA program, was opened. In 2016, the Abercrombie Building was opened by The Hon. Gladys Berejiklian MP, Treasurer of NSW and Minister for Industrial Relations, and Deputy Liberal Leader. In 2017, the Business School launched a new full-time MBA program for 2018 entry.
