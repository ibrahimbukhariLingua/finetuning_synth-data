## Inception

The Alberta Government Telephones (AGT), had served as the major telephone provider for the province of Alberta from 1906—when it was first established by the Liberal Party of Alberta under the tenure of then Premier of Alberta, Alexander Cameron Rutherford, until the 1990s—when then Premier Don Getty began the privatization process.²⁵⁰ NovaTel's liabilities eventually cost the government more than $600 million.²⁵⁰³⁵ The initial public offering of the newly established Telus' shares, represented the largest in Canadian history up to this time. The following year the provincial government divested its remaining ownership interest in Telus for $870 million. By 1996, the former brand names, ED TEL and AGT had been retired. All Telus products and companies adopted the TELUS brand name.

Telus merged with British Columbia Telephone Company (BC Tel) in 1999, with the merged company keeping the TELUS brand name. The headquarters of BC Tel in Burnaby, BC became the headquarters of the merged Telus Corporation, and the company moved its corporate headquarters to Vancouver after completion of the Telus Garden complex.
