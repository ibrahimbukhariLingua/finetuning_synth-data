# Bigblu Broadband



**Bigblu Broadband**, formerly **Satellite Solutions Worldwide Group plc**, is a UK-based provider of broadband services to rural homes and businesses across Europe.


## History

Bigblu was founded in November 2008 by Andrew Walwyn, Simon Clifton, Selwyn Petterson, and Tom Wheeler as Satellite Solutions Worldwide Group. The company offers satellite internet and superfast broadband to rural homes and businesses in 10 countries across Europe, including the UK.

Initially, the company focused on satellite broadband, becoming one of the largest satellite broadband ISPs worldwide. It later diversified and began offering alternative broadband using both satellite and ultra-fast fixed wireless. The business was listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) AIM market in May 2015. At this time it had approximately 10,000 customers, which has since grown through a mixture of organic and inorganic growth (through acquisitions) to approximately 120,000 customers. In 2018 it had revenues of £55 million (up 8%), but recorded a pre-tax loss of £9.5 million.

The company has partnerships with Eutelsat and NBN SkyMuster.
