It involves executing trades of large volumes near the close, with the intention of manipulating closing prices.

Optiver factored in $19.3 million into its 2010 annual report towards this case. The case was settled in 2012, where Optiver was fined $14 million, of which $1 million was part of profit disgorgement. With effect for 2 years, Optiver was barred from trading any US oil futures in the last 3 minutes before close. Several traders were also handed out bans for trading commodities, ranging from 2 to 8 years in length.
