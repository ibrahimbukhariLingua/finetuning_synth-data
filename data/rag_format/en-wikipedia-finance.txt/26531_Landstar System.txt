Landstar System


# Landstar System



**Landstar System, Inc.** is a transportation services company specializing in logistics and more specifically third-party logistics. Landstar also utilizes an extensive network of more than 11,000 independent owner operators, referred to internally as business capacity owners (BCOs). Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada and between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico, and other countries around the world.


## History

The company is based in Jacksonville, Florida. Landstar has been in business since 1968 and was incorporated in 1991.

In January 2014, Landstar sold its National Logistics Management (NLM) subsidiary to XPO, Inc. for $87m. Using proprietary web-based software to provide management services for customers and carriers, NLM became the largest web-based expediter in North America. In January 2017, Landstar opened its Landstar U.S./Mexico Logistics Service Center in Laredo, Texas.


## Business model

Landstar includes over 10,000 owner-operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The business capacity operators (BCOs) are not forced to dispatch like traditional trucking companies. Rather, they can choose their own loads. Landstar has agents in the United States and Canada.

Landstar currently offers scholarships and has a nonprofit "benevolence fund" to assist Landstar operators.
