## History

Yango initially started in 2018 as a brand developed by the team of Yandex Taxi and managed by Ridetech International B.V., a subsidiary of Yandex N.V., a Netherlands-registered holding company for the Russian IT conglomerate Yandex LLC. As of now Yango Group operates independently with HQ in Dubai.

Since its inception, the company’s flagship service Yango Ride has grown to operate in more than 25 countries. Its business model focuses on collaborating with local taxi companies, enhancing their efficiency through technology rather than owning vehicles or employing drivers directly. By empowering local partners to optimize their operations, Yango Ride began supporting the development of small and medium-sized businesses in its initial markets as early as 2018.

Yango has diversified its operations beyond ride-hailing to include sectors such as mapping, mobility, entertainment, robotics, AI smart devices and so on.

Yango's beta ride-hailing app was launched on October 4, 2018, in Abidjan (Ivory Coast) in French. On November 9, 2018, it was launched in Finland. In addition to Helsinki, as of December 2020 Yango operates in Tampere and Turku.

Yango’s ride-hailing business was officially launched in Israel on December 10, 2018. The app was installed by 100,000 users there in the first two weeks. The firm introduced a controversial new business model in the local taxi sector that offered passengers the exact price of rides known in advance. This fixed-price feature has drawn scrutiny from the Israeli Ministry of Transportation because it may violate Israeli law, which mandates that cab drivers can only charge the price indicated by the meter. In March 2020, Yango announced that it would offer the option of working directly with the company to independent licensed taxi drivers, after previously working with drivers only through taxi companies.

Yango launched its ride-hailing service in Accra, Ghana in June 2019.

In July 2021, Yango launched in Oslo, Norway. As of November 2021 the ride-hailing business has expanded and is available in Bergen.

In August and October 2021, Yango rolled out its grocery delivery service in Paris and London respectively.

The company continued to expand in Africa and in November 2021 launched ride-hailing platform in Douala and Yaounde, Cameroon.

In November 2021, street-hailing drivers of Côte d'Ivoire organized strikes against Yango, blaming the company for working with VTC drivers, which has been outside the scope of the current legislation in the country. This led to establishment of a working group on upgrading the transport law by the Ministry of Transport. Later the VTC concept had been introduced to the legislation, providing Yango and other ride-hailing services in the market with opportunity to obtain temporary licenses.

In December 2021, Yango launched its ride-hailing app in Dakar, Senegal and opened a center for its partner-drivers in the city.

In March 2022, Yango ride-hailing service became available in Zambia.

In December 2024, Beninese authorities suspended Yango, accusing it of operating without authorization, and asked Gozem to regularize Yango's situation "within two months".

In December 2024, Yango Ads signed a partnership with Landmark Reach, the retail media division of Landmark Group, one of the leading retailers in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Through the partnership, Yango Ads will provide its in-depth analytics, a suite of advertising options, and a campaign management platform to empower advertisers reaching Landmark Retail’s ecosystem of brands and millions of monthly shoppers.


## Special features

Yango does not have its own cars or drivers, partnering instead with local transport companies and drivers. In countries where the company operates, its partners have opened dedicated driver centers.


## Permissions controversy

Yango asks for permission to access certain phone features in order to tailor the user experience. In November 2018, Finland's largest national newspaper *Helsingin Sanomat* recommended not to download the app due to security risks from data collection. Following an investigation, the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority found that Yango's terms of service were essentially the same as Uber's.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Soon after, *Helsingin Sanomat* published a follow-up article comparing permission rights requested by various taxi applications; it placed Yango second after Uber.

The taxi activities are prohibited in Estonia and Latvia. In August 2023 the Norwegian and Finnish data privacy authorities told Yango to stop processing data about their citizens in Russia, after the Russian government introduced a legal duty for the company to deliver personal information to the Russian Federal Security Service.
