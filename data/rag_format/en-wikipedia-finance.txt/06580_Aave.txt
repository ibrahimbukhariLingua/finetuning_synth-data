Aave


# Aave




**Aave**, formerly known as **ETHLend**, is an open-source decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol which was initially built on the Ethereum blockchain and released in 2020. It is one of the largest cryptocurrency liquidity protocols. The Aave Protocol uses smart contracts to automate processes, including distributing funds and handling collateral.


## Overview

Aave Protocol allows anyone with a cryptocurrency wallet to supply and borrow digital assets across Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, and other EVM-compatible blockchains by posting collateral, without third-party intermediaries such as banks and brokerages. Suppliers share the interest paid by borrowers, who deposit cryptocurrency assets into different liquidity pools. In turn, suppliers can use their cryptocurrency assets as collateral to borrow at stable or variable interest rates. There are currently three versions of Aave, each of which implemented upgrades to the decentralized protocol: V1, V2 and V3.

Version 3 of the protocol, Aave v3, went live in 2023 with lower transaction fees and the ability to supply and borrow across virtually all Layer 2 blockchains that use Ethereum as a settlement layer.

In October 2021, Aave reached approximately $28 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) across multiple chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. A 2022 academic paper examined collateral liquidations on Aave, where arbitrageurs repay loans in exchange for discounted collateral, often using flash loans. By analyzing blockchain data, it highlights the price effects of these liquidity trades on decentralized exchanges and demonstrates both temporary and permanent impacts on asset prices.

The Aave Protocol is governed by AAVE token holders who form the Aave Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

A study by Gudgeon et al (2020) reviewed the methodologies for setting interest rates in DeFi protocols for loanable funds (PLFs), which are decentralized markets using distributed ledgers and smart contracts to facilitate borrowing and saving, with interest rate mechanisms balancing supply and demand. The study reviewed the methodologies for setting interest rates in three major DeFi PLFs,ʷʰⁱᶜʰ? empirically analyzing their behavior under varying liquidity conditions and investigating the relationships between interest rates across different protocols using a Vector Error Correction Modelᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.

A study by Ao et al. (2022) applied social network analysis to measure decentralization in DeFi token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, focusing on the AAVE token. It found a core-periphery structureᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ in the transaction network, with centralized exchanges at the core, and reportedly demonstrated that greater decentralization was associated with higher returns and lower volatility in AAVE markets.


## History

The Aave Protocol was founded and released on Ethereum mainnet in January 2020 by Aave Labs founder Stani Kulechov, Russian-born Finnish programmer and lawyer who had moved to Finland with his family as a child. *Aave* means "ghost" in Finnish, which speaks to the transparent aspect of the decentralized open source protocol.

Aave was preceded by ETHLend, also developed by Kulechov, which launched in 2017.

In July 2023, Aave released GHO, an Aave-native, decentralized stablecoin. GHO is backed by assets available in the Aave Protocol.
