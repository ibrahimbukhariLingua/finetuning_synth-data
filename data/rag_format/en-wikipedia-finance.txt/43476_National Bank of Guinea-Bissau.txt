National Bank of Guinea-Bissau


# National Bank of Guinea-Bissau



The **National Bank of Guinea-Bissau** (Portuguese: *Banco Nacional da Guiné-Bissau* or **BNG**) was the central bank of Guinea-Bissau from February 1975 until May 1997, when Guinea-Bissau joined the Central Bank of West African States.


## History

At independence in February 1975, Guinea-Bissau nationalized the Banco Nacional Ultramarino, Portuguese bank's branch, and transformed it into the country's central bank. The currency, Portuguese escudo, was replaced with Guinea-Bissau peso. In 1990, the bank was renamed as the **Central Bank of Guinea Bissau** (*Banco Central da Guiné-Bissau*).

In May 1997 Guinea-Bissau joined the francophone West African Monetary Union *Union Économique et Monétaire Ouest-Africaine* (UEMOA). Consequently, National Bank of Guinea-Bissau was converted as a national branch of Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), and national currency Guinea Bissau peso was replaced by West African CFA franc.
