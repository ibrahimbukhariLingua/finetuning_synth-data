Warradarge Wind Farm


# Warradarge Wind Farm



**Warradarge Wind Farm** is located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) northeast of Warradarge, and 30 kilometres (19 mi) southeast of Eneabba in the Mid West region of Western Australia. Construction commenced in 2019 and the first of its planned 51 turbines was completed on 21 January 2020. The wind farm has been operational since August 2020.

It is owned by Bright Energy Investments, a joint venture between the Dutch fund manager DIF Capital Partners (40.05%), Australian industry superannuation fund Cbus (40.05%), and the Western Australian government's electricity generator and retailer Synergy (19.9%). The construction and maintenance contracts are with Danish company Vestas.

Originally proposed in 2012 for up to 100 turbines generating 250 MW of electricity, the wind farm was completed in 2020 with 51 turbines, capable of generating up to 180 MW for the South West Interconnected System, the electricity grid in southern Western Australia, equivalent to providing power for 144,000 homes.

The wind turbines are manufactured by Vestas with 66 metre blades and a tip height of 152 metres above the ground. Western Power constructed a 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) transmission line from the wind farm to the existing 330 kV transmission network near Eneabba.

In 2023 funding was announced for a potential expansion of the wind farm.


## Operations

Operations began in August 2020. The generation table uses AEMO Facility SCADA to obtain generation values for each month. Warradarge's code is WARRADARGE\_WF1. A SUMIF operation is used on the data published by AEMO to get the total (shown in the table below). Each month's values start 8 hours into the respective month and extend 8 hours into the next month, in line with the trading day defined in the Wholesale Energy Market Rules.
