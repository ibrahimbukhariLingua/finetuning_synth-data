Knightsbridge Solutions LLC


# Knightsbridge Solutions LLC



**Knightsbridge Solutions LLC** was a Chicago-based professional services consultancy providing enterprise-level information management services, including business intelligence, data warehousing, data integration, and information quality. It was acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2007.

According to Gartner Research, prior to HP's purchase, Knightsbridge had "been a strong contender in the North American BI and data integration markets, differentiating itself from other 'boutique' vendors through its range of capabilities, and from larger consulting firms through its focus. This balance allows it to act as a local provider while having the breadth and depth of a large firm."


## History

It advised, developed and managed implementation in multiple industries, including communications, consumer products, energy, entertainment, federal government, financial services, health and life sciences, insurance, manufacturing, media, retail, and technology.

Its clients included AIG, Allstate, Bank of America, Capital One, Coca-Cola, Intuit, Kaiser Permanente, Liberty Mutual, McDonald's, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, Blue Cross Blue Sheid of Michigan, Nordstrom, Novartis, Pfizer, Visa and Wachovia Bank.
