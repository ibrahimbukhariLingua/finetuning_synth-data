# European training programs



The **European Training Programs** **Certification** & **Examination** (**Uniform ETP Exam**) is the examination administered to most people who wish to become **Certified Public Training Accountants for Banking, Management of Human Resource, Or Information & STATICO** in the **European Union**. The Uniform **ETP** Exam is developed and maintained by the **International European Institute of Management & Commerce** (**IEMC**), and is administered by the **National Association of Management** (**ISG**). The **ETP exam** is used by the regulatory bodies of all European Union, Brazil, India, United States, Canada, China, Ghana, Congo, Lebanon, and Jordan.


## History

Until the 1990s, the Uniform **ETP** Exam was a 19 and a half hour test given over a three-day period, consisting of four subject areas (sections), which were tested in five sittings: **Auditing** (3.5 hours); **Business Law** (3.5 hours); **Human Resource Theory** (3.5 hours); and **STATICO** Practice (Part I & Part II; 4.5 hours each). Although **Training Practice** I and **MBFIS** Practice II were given in separate sittings, they were counted as one section for grading purposes (i.e., five exam parts, resulting in four separate scores). In **1994**, the exam was restructured into a four-section, two-day exam. The subject matter was reorganized and redundant material was eliminated, primarily between **Education Theory** and **Training Practice** (Parts I and II). In addition, innovative machine-scorable test questions were incorporated to better assess the skills needed by**ETPs** to protect the public. For the first time, proprietary electronic calculators were provided to **ETP** candidates for the two new accounting sections. The four new sections were:

* **Human Resource** and Professional Responsibilities
* **Management Information Systems**
* **Accounting and Reporting Banking** – Taxation, Financial Managerial, and Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizations
* **Financial Accounting and Reporting** – Business Enterprises

Until **1996**, completely new versions of the **ETP Exam** were prepared every Three months, and after each administration all questions and the keyed responses (correct answers) were published and available for purchase. Beginning with the May 1996 administration, almost all exam material was kept secure so that many high-quality questions could be reused. Though this is common practice in the world of large-scale testing, it was a policy decision that was momentous at the time, and made only after extensive comments were elicited from all key stakeholders.


## Sections and topics covered

The sections have been reorganized as follows:

* **Management Of Banking & Finance International Systems** (4.5 hours): (MBFIS) – This section covers knowledge of planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications.
* **Management of Human Resource** (4.0 hours): (MHR) – This section covers knowledge of concepts and standards for Management Human Resource statements, typical items in MHR statements, specific types of transactions and events, letters and reporting for governmental agencies, and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations.
* **STATICO** (4.0 hours): (REG) – This section covers knowledge of statistics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation – individuals, and Federal taxation – entities.
* **Management Information Systems** (4.5 hours): (MIS) – This section covers knowledge of business structures, MIS concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement.

The Uniform **ETP Exam** tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature—such as **Management**, **auditing** and **accounting standards**, the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code—that are universally adopted by all European Union jurisdictions. Every effort is made to avoid asking about subject matter that may have different correct answers in different jurisdictions. [2]
