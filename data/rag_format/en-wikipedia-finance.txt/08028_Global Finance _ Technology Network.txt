Global Finance & Technology Network


# Global Finance & Technology Network



**Global Finance & Technology Network (GFTN)** (formerly **Elevandi**) is created by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to serve expanding Singapore's fintech ecosystem globally.

GFTN will focus on four business lines â€“ organising fintech festivals, providing advisory and research services, providing digital platform services to SMEs, and establishing a fund for investing on technology related start-ups.

Ravi Menon, former managing director of the MAS is appointed as the chairman of GFTN.


## History

GFTN replaces and builds upon Elevandi, the non-profit organisation created by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in August 2021 to foster an active and open dialogue between the public and private sectors, to advance FinTech further in the global digital economy.

GFTN will continue to operate as a not-for-profit, and will work with the MAS on industry and policy dialogues in the area of payments, asset tokenization, AI and quantum.
