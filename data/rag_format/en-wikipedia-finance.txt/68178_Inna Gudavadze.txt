# Inna Gudavadze



**Inna Gudavadze** (Georgian: ინა გუდავაძე) is a Georgian-British businesswoman and philanthropist. She is the founder of a London-based family office overseeing her family assets with a focus on diversified portfolio of investments. She also is the founder of the Gudavadze-Patarkatsishvili Foundation which supports education initiatives in Georgia.

Born in Tbilisi, Georgia, Gudavadze graduated with honours from the Georgian State Institute of Foreign Languages. She married Badri Patarkatsishvili, Georgian businessman and philanthropist, in 1979 with whom she had two daughters, Liana and Iya. For 19 years she worked at the Tbilisi Scientific Research Institute of Electron-Ion Technology. She helped her husband during his life with numerous charitable and civic projects. The family moved to Moscow in 1993 and returned to Georgia in 2000. Since 2006 the family resides in the UK.

Following the untimely intestate death of her husband, Badri Patarkatsishvili, in 2008, Gudavadze and her family were thrust into a series of complex legal battles to reclaim assets across multiple jurisdictions, all of which have been successfully won or settled in favour of Gudavadze and her family.
