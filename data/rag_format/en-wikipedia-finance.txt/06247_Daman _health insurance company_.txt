## Cardless insurance

In 2017, Daman phased out the use of plastic insurance cards, when it linked the insurance policies to the Emirates ID number of their policy holders. Members do not need to show a regular insurance card when seeking treatment, as the treatment facility can obtain the insurance details of the patient using their Emirates ID number.


## Diabetes management program

In 2010, the company launched its diabetes management program, a program that provides nutritional and exercise advice to their diabetic patients and provides them with personal and educational support. ***As of March 2021***, over 17,000 patients have been enrolled in the program.
