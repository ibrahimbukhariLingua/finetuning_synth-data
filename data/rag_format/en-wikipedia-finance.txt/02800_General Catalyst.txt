## History

General Catalyst was founded in 2000 in Massachusetts by Joel Cutler and David Fialkow.

In 2010, the company opened a Silicon Valley office. In 2021, the firm managed more than $8 billion in assets. In February 2022, it raised $4.6 billion for its 11th general fund. This brought the firm's total raised in its 20-year history to $14.75 billion.

In 2021, the firm opened a London office. By September 2022, General Catalyst had invested in 17 European startups. By April 2023, the company had invested in 25 Indian startups, including CRED, Uni, Spinny, Orange Health, FarMart, and Loop Health with investments ranging in all stages.

In March 2023, General Catalyst was a supporter of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), after U.S. regulators shut it down after a significant number of the bank's customers sought to withdraw funds after dropping stock prices. General Catalyst, which was a SVB customer, organized a joint statement of support signed by more than 110 venture capital firms.

As of 2020, it was ranked as one of America's largest venture capital firms.

In June 2024, General Catalyst acquired La Famiglia, a German venture capital firm, after which La Famiglia's founding partner Jeannette zu Fürstenberg became the managing director at General Catalyst, overseeing its European business.

In October 2024, General Catalyst announced the raise of $8 billion in new funds, including $4.5 billion for their core venture funds, making it their largest fundraise yet.

### Healthcare fund

In 2021, General Catalyst raised $600 million for a new Health Assurance Fund.

In July 2022, the firm raised an additional $670 million. The money is invested in healthcare businesses. General Catalyst has been the most active investor in healthcare since the beginning of 2020.

In October 2023, the company announced plans to acquire a health system and "then use it as a proving ground for technology that its portfolio companies sell, including generative artificial intelligence-powered solutions applied to health care problems."

General Catalyst spent $485 million to purchase Summa Health and convert a non-profit health network into for-profit.
