The company was founded in 1993 as China Iron & Steel Trade & Industry Group Corporation and changed its name to Sinosteel Corporation in August 2004. Sinosteel Corporation is based in Beijing, China.

Sinosteel in 2008 completed a hostile takeover of Australian iron ore producer, Midwest Corporation, cornering 51% of the shares of the company in a A$1.36 billion acquisition. It was the first successful hostile takeover of an Australian public company by a Chinese company.

In 2016, due to heavy debt of 60 million yuan owed to financial institutions, Sinosteel was greenlit for swapping 27 billion yuan of its debt for equity convertible bonds under a new government policy designed to curb run-away corporate debt in the economy.

In 2022, Sinosteel was acquired and became a subsidiary of Baowu, a fellow state-owned Chinese enterprise that is the world's biggest steel maker.
