## History

David Eccles who emigrated to Utah from Scotland in 1863 had a founding interest in Utah International, which was later inherited by Marriner and George Eccles. The two sons, together with Marriner A. Browning, expanded their financial interests to 17 banks and a building and loan company, later brought under one holding company, First Security Corporation, in June 1928.

In 1932, First Security acquired Deseret National Bank, which had been founded in 1871 by Brigham Young. It then moved its headquarters from Ogden to Salt Lake City.

In 2000, First Security was absorbed into Wells Fargo. First Security stockholders received 0.355 of a share of Wells Fargo common stock in exchange for each share of First Security common stock.
