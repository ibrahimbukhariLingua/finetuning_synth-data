## Opposition to mining

There is a political opposition in Guatemala to mining, particularly open pit mining, financed by international organizations. Opposition is based on both environmental concerns and opposition to globalization. The indigenous Maya peoples organizations have been extremely active in opposing international mining projects despite government support of them. In particular the Escobal mine protests have seen substantial anti-mining activism by the Xinca people.
