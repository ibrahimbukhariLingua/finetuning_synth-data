The Paper Province


# The Paper Province



**The Paper Province** is a business cluster for the pulp and paper industry in Värmland, northern Dalsland and the county of Örebro in central Sweden. It is focussed on encouraging collaboration on marketing, skills development, procurement, project development and regional growth. The cluster organization is owned and operated by its 90 member companies, from global giants to local suppliers, representing the entire value chain.


## History

Business history in Värmland and the surrounding area is strongly influenced by the region's natural wealth. Successful exploitation of the forest started early, and already in the mid-19th century there were more than 50 pulp and paper mills in the region. This attracted both skills and suppliers to the region. Much the technology used and installed in pulp and paper mills throughout the world still originates here.

At the end of the 1990s, the pulp and paper industry was facing severe structural challenges. To meet these needs, seven companies, together with Karlstad’s county and other public bodies, formed the cluster organization 'The Paper Province'. The number of member companies has grown to 90 with over 9,000 employees and annual sales of approximately SEK 17 billion, of which 13.5 billion contributes to Sweden’s net exports. In this, the member companies represent a significant part of the region's economy, with effects on both the regional and national economy.
