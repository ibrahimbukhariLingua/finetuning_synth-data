**Moon Active** (Hebrew: **מון אקטיב בע"מ**) is a private Israeli company that develops online games.


## History

The company was founded in 2011 by Shmuel (Molly) Albin and is engaged in the development of online games. The company's headquarters is located in Tel Aviv, where approximately 800 employees were working as of October 2021. Additionally, around 500 employees are based in Europe, including a large development center in Kyiv and an office in London.

In its early years, the company developed four games, none of which were successful. In January 2016, the company released Coin Master for smartphones on the iOS and Android operating systems, which became a major success. According to estimates, the game's gross revenue (including commissions to Apple and Google) reached $100 million in 2018, $550 million in 2019, and $1.25 billion in 2020. The game features a slot machine that grants coins to players, who must then build villages and raid the villages of other players. While the game is free-to-play, frequent gameplay often requires in-app purchases.

At the beginning of 2020, the venture capital Insight Partners purchased 10% of the company's shares for $125 million, turning the company into a unicorn.

In December 2020, the company acquired Melsoft, a Cyprus-based company with a development center in Belarus, known for developing network games such as *Family Island* and *My Cafe*.

In November 2021, the company conducted a secondary fundraising round, during which existing shareholders, including employees and investors, sold shares totaling $300 million, based on a company valuation of $5 billion.

In August 2024, Moon Active hit $6 billion milestone with Coin Master.
