The initial purpose of the bank was to carry out settlements between enterprises of the agro-industrial complex, but due to both the general recession of the Russian economy in the early and mid-1990s and the decline of the agro-industry in particular, it lost its importance and by 1996 ceased pro-active activity. The following facts about the bank at that time are known: the receipt in December 1993 of an extended currency license, which allows (in addition to carrying out currency operations in Russia (domestic foreign exchange license)) to establish correspondent relations with six foreign banks; in July 1994, along with some other credit organizations made the announcement on the discovery of fake bank documents (guarantee letters); in 1996 the trial with the Avtoselkhozmash bank because of the latter's debt.

The bank was founded in 1999 by Roustam Tariko owner of the Russian Standard Corporation, as a means of circumventing new laws which banned the advertising of alcohol in Russia.

## Criticism

The lecturer of the "Synergy University", A. Ishutin, pointing out that the bad reputation of the bank leads to inefficiency in attracting funds by the bank, and as an example he cited the Russian Standard Bank, whose image in the mid-2000s he described as an image of "predatory and dishonest bank".

In 2010, the Nizhny Tagil branch of the "Young Lawyers of Russia" public movement have collected the signatures for a petition to the Russian Prosecutor General's Office, the Presidential Administration of Russia and the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection. The head of the branch of the movement, Yevgeny Ryakin, noted that many people came to them with complaints about debt collection methods carried out by this bank. Ryakin gave the following example: "One woman said that she had been offered by the bank representative to sell a kidney in order to pay off the loan". Ryakin also pointed to "constant telephone calls, even at night; threatening letters; visits of collectors, etc.", which, in his estimation, in many cases "is beyond the limits of the law". In addition, Ryakin noted "repeated violations of the legislation as well as the Civil Code of the Russian Federation by the credit organization".

The story in which a woman took a loan from *Russian Standard Bank* in the amount of 45 thousand rubles, but failed to pay for it due to illness and loss of work, received considerable publicity, as a result of which the debt rose to 150 thousand rubles a few months later. In February 2013, the collectors of Russian Standard Bank offered a woman to solve the debt problem by selling her internal organs, as well as, according to A. V. Ivanov, Assistant Professor, Department of Advertising of the Russian University of Economics of Plekhanov and of the Chelyabinsk branch of the South Urals State TV and Radio Company, "they offered to sell the infant child of her sister".

In November 2023 the bank was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.
