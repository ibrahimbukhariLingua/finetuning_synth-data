AFGG, under its original name the Alliance for School Choice, was launched on May 17, 2004, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision *Brown v. Board of Education*, with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. The formation of the Alliance for School Choice represented the merger of three organizations: the American Education Reform Council, Children First America, and the American Education Reform Foundation.

Clint Bolick was appointed as the Alliance's first president in 2004. Bolick resigned his position at the Alliance in 2007 to take a new post at the Arizona-based Goldwater Institute. Charles R. Hokanson Jr., a former official at the U.S. Department of Education, served as the organization's president from 2007-2008.


## Activities

AFCGF has several initiatives, including Black Minds Matter, a national movement to celebrate Black minds, support excellence, and promote the development of high-quality school options for Black students. They encourage and empower elected officials, community members and families to be innovative, demand excellence in education, and increase the number of schools founded by Black individuals. Black owned school directory is the first-ever online directory to promote schools founded by African Americans.

La Federación Americana para Los Niños is a project that focuses on outreach to Hispanic families.

AFC's Future Leaders Fellowship is designed to identify and develop new leaders in the educational choice movement. It is a twelve-month advocacy training program for graduates of publicly created K-12 school choice programs.


## Activities

AFCG shares offices, staff and resources with the American Federation for Children (once called "Advocates for School Choice") which is a 501(c)(4) organization that promotes school choice programs.

AFCGF activities include assisting affiliate organizations in states, hosting informational events, working with parent activists and community leaders to enact and implement state programs, and publishing two magazines, the *School Choice Digest* and the *Activist.* The Alliance has also engaged in litigation efforts.
