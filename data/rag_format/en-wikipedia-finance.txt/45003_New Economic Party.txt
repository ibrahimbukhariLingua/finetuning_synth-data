## History

In December 2020, Zelekha announced that he formed a new political party, which would be called the New Economic Party, based on an economic vision and will run as a candidate in the March 2021 national election in Israel.

In January of 2021, ahead of the deadline to submit the party's electoral list, Zelekha announced his party's slate for the upcoming election, which included several professors, who were designated as the party's nominees for various cabinet positions.
