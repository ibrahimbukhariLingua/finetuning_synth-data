## History

The company was founded in 1787. On his mother's and stepfather's death in 1828, Christen Winther Obel took over the factory, changing its name to C.W. Obel. Under Obel's leadership, the factory became the city's main employer, a position it maintained for many years.

In 1857, steam engines were introduced in the production and a production of cigars was set up. The factory was several times damaged by fires and a new factory was built on the outskirts of Aalborg in 1898. It was later expanded several times. In 1919, C.W. Obel opened a branch in Copenhagen.

In 1937, the company was converted into a family-owned stock company (*aktieselskab*) and the Copenhagen branch moved into newly acquired premises in Obels Gård at Vestergade No. 2. The Obelisk Family Fund (*Det Obelske Familiefond*) was established in 1956. In 1961, C.W. Obel merged with Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker and R. Færchs Fabrikker under the name Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni. In 1971, C.W. Obel A/S was listed on Copenhagen Stock Exchange but was delisted in 2001.
