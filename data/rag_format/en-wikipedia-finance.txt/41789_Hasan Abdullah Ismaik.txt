## Acquisition of shares of TSV 1860 Munich

In June 2011, Ismaik bought 60 percent, an investment of €18 million ($25.8 million) of TSV 1860 Munich, a German sports club based in Munich that plays in the 3. Liga. Becoming the first Arab to acquire shares of a German football club, Ismaik claimed that his aim was to safeguard the survival of the club that was one of the founding members of the German national Bundesliga. Due to DFL regulations, Ismaik only has 49 percent of the voting rights; the additional shares are without voting rights.

Ismaik commented on the acquisition:

> TSV 1860 has a great tradition and identity that ought to be preserved and supported. The club has enormous potential and a truly great and passionate fan base. I will do everything to bring TSV 1860 back into the profit zone."
> 
> — Arabian Business

The acquisition was followed by a long and controversial discussion about Ismaik's goals and intentions regarding this investment, which is still ongoing (Status as of December 2016).

Since the acquisition of the shares, neither the financial situation nor the sporting success of TSV 1860 Munich have improved significantly.

At the end of the 2016–17 season, TSV 1860 Munich were relegated to the third tier of German football following a play-off defeat against Jahn Regensburg. Unable to resolve his differences with club officials regarding his control of the club, Ismaik refused to provide the approximately ten million euros necessary for a 3.Liga playing license and the club was subsequently automatically relegated even further to the regional fourth tier. Ismaik remains in control.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
