The Financial Conduct Authority, which replaced the Office of Fair Trading in 2014, gave Christians Against Poverty full authorisation in 2017.

Stewart McCulloch is the current Chief Executive Officer, and joined CAP in January 2024.

CAP also has independently operated affiliates in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States.


## Services

Christians Against Poverty offers several different services. Since the organisation was founded in 1996, it has been best known for offering free debt counselling. The organisation works through a network of regional offices that exist in partnership with a local Christian church. Individuals seeking the assistance of the charity give authority to the charity to negotiate with creditors, and the charity will then organise the individual's finances with the objective of making them debt free. The debt advisor will create a personal budget for clients, prioritising basic living needs and offering creditors fair and affordable pro-rata payments whenever possible.

In 2013, CAP launched job clubs, a service targeted at the unemployed. In 2015, CAP launches life skills groups, teaching practical skills to survive life on a low income.

CAP also runs money coaching workshops, previously known as the 'CAP Money Course' to teach budgeting skills. The course exists in a number of variations, tailored to young people, students and adults.

In 2024, CAP created free budgeting resources for kids and youth to help teach children money management skills.


## Policy work

As well as providing debt advice and money coaching services, CAP’s Policy and Research team gathers evidence and research, undertakes consultations and publishes reports to help decision-makers develop and shape policy. The team also campaigns and petitions, attends events and roundtables, and advocates for people in debt and on low incomes. CAP advocates for structural changes to legislation, impacting on the quality of life of those living on a low income.

The charity has won a number of awards, including "Debt Advice Provider of the Year" at the 2015 Collections and Customer Service Awards, the "Martin Williams Award for Contribution to the Credit Industry" at the 2014 Credit Today Awards, as well as Charity Times Awards' "Best Charity to Work For" in 2006 and 2007.
