## History

Esanda was established in October 1955 as the commercial financing division of the English, Scottish & Australian Bank (ES&A). It became a subsidiary of the ANZ Bank after it merged with ES&A in 1970. After ANZ acquired the Bank of Adelaide in 1979 and the National Mutual Royal Bank in 1990, the respective finance divisions were incorporated into Esanda.

In 2016, the dealer finance portfolio was sold to Macquarie Group. In March 2019, ANZ retired the Esanda brand.
