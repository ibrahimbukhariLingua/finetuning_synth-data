The News Lens


# The News Lens



***The News Lens*** (TNL) is an independent digital media based in Taiwan, founded by Joey Chung and Mario Yang in 2013, with multilingual versions in Chinese, English and Japanese. Since 2017, it has maintained content partnerships with other outlets such as Time and Fortune. Article categories include politics, economics, technology, society, and more.

As of 2018, *The News Lens* had significantly fewer readers in Taiwan than the top local outlets like Apple Daily, Sanlih, or Dongsen, which led it to expand its readership to reach other places such as Hong Kong, the United States and Southeast Asia.

By July 2020, following a series of acquisitions, TNL Media Group successfully expanded into data analytics and advertising technology fields. In 2022, it was featured by Harvard Business School as a Case Study for Leadership & Managing People. It has become one of the fastest-growing digital content and technology companies in the global Mandarin market. In May 2023, it acquired Mediagene, Japan's largest native digital media group, marking the first instance of a Taiwanese media company acquiring a foreign media entity. The following month, it announced its new company name as TNL Mediagene [zh] and declared its intention to list on the NASDAQ in the United States in 2024.
