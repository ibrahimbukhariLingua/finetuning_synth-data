Cambridge Judge Business School


# Cambridge Judge Business School



**Cambridge Judge Business School** is the business school of the University of Cambridge. The School is a provider of management education. It is named after Sir Paul Judge, a founding benefactor of the school. The School is a department of the university's School of Technology administrative group.

The School is embedded in the high tech cluster called the Silicon Fen, with its own accelerator and close ties with Cambridge Enterprise, the university's technology transfer office.

The School is situated on the site of the Old Addenbrooke's Site on Trumpington Street, near the Fitzwilliam Museum. The building was converted by John Outram, and in 2018, a new adjacent building was opened to host classes and executive education activity: the Simon Sainsbury Centre.


## History


### Founding and early years

The School was established in 1990 as the Judge Institute for Management Studies. In 1991, donations from Sir Paul and Lady Judge, together with the Monument Trust, provided the funds for the construction of a building for the newly formed business school. Architect John Outram was appointed to the project, which was completed in August 1995 and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

Prior to the founding of the business school, management studies had been taught at the university since 1954.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Name changes

In September 2005, the Judge Institute of Management Studies was renamed as the Judge Business School. It then adopted the title Cambridge Judge Business School during 2010, and revised its logo to read "University of Cambridge Judge Business School" rather than "Cambridge Judge Business School" in November 2010.

Benefactor Sir Paul Judge died in 2017.


## Architecture

John Outram converted the listed ward blocks and arcades of the old hospital building, and rebuilt the central block into a space that now contains a library, common room, seminar and teaching rooms, floating staircases and balconies, break-out boxes and the main hall. He also added three new buildings:

* The Ark, containing rooms for faculty, research graduates, and administrative staff.
* The Castle, containing two key lecture theatres and MBA teaching spaces and room.
* The Gallery, an 80 feet (24.5m) high space containing seminar rooms, multi-level circulation routes, and part of the hall.
