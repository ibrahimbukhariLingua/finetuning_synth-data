Overweight (stock market)


# Overweight (stock market)



Within the stock market, the term **overweight** can be used in two different contexts.

1. A rating of a stock by a financial analyst as having better value for money than other stocks. The other possible ratings are "underweight" and "equal weight", to indicate a particular stock's attractiveness.
2. A judgement of an investment portfolio that it holds proportionately more than the benchmark weight of a certain asset (a share, bond, industry/sector, country, currency, or asset class, etc.).

## Examples


### Financial analysis rating

Definition 1: If a particular stock is selling for $500 and the analyst feels that the stock is worth $600, the analyst would be declaring the stock to be overweight.

Definition 2: Suppose that Technology stocks make up 10% of the relevant stock index by market value. For example, the weight of the Technology sector in the index could be 10%.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Investment portfolio

*Overweight* — Suppose that an investor holds 15% of his/her investment in Technology stocks. The investor's stock portfolio is then 15% overweight in Technology stocks.

Suppose further that the investor is advised by his broker or financial adviser that technology stocks should be "overweight." The investor is being advised to hold *more* investments in Technology, as a percentage, than the weight of that asset in the index/market. In this example, the recommendation is to hold *more* than 10% of the value of Technology shares.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

*Underweight* — In contrast to overweight holdings, if the broker advises that technology stocks should be "underweight," the recommendation to the investor is to hold *less* than 10% of the value of Technology shares.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

*Equal weight* - The third possibility is that the broker advises that technology stocks should have "equal weight." In which case, the recommendation is to hold 10% of the value of Technology shares.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
