# Naranja X



**Naranja X** (**NX**; formerly known as **Tarjeta Naranja**) is an Argentine fintech company with headquarters in Córdoba and Buenos Aires. Founded in 1986, Naranja X offers a wide range of financial services, including loans, credit cards, and other financial products within its ecosystem.


## History

Founded in 1985, Tarjeta Naranja started in Córdoba with the goal of providing in-house financing to customers of the Salto 96 sports store, created by entrepreneurs and physical education teachers David Ruda and Gerardo Asrin. Gerardo Asrin passed away in 2017.

In 1995, Banco Galicia became a shareholder, acquiring 49% of the shares, which drove Tarjeta Naranja's expansion across Argentina and the introduction of new financial services and plans. This support quickly accelerated the company's growth, leading the bank to increase its stake from 49% to 80% in 1998 through capital contributions and by purchasing additional shares from Ruda and Asrin.

The company then focused on providing financial services, primarily through credit cards, with an emphasis on accessibility and financial inclusion. Over the years, Naranja X has expanded its services and established a broad network of branches and customer service points throughout the country.

Naranja X offers a variety of financial products, including credit cards, personal loans, and insurance. The company is known for its community presence and commitment to offering financial solutions to various segments of the population.

In 2017, the company rebranded as Naranja, aiming to expand its product portfolio and become a digital solutions ecosystem. In 2018, it merged with Tarjeta Nevada, extending its presence to Mendoza and San Juan.

With two main offices in Córdoba and Buenos Aires, Naranja X has established a presence across Argentina with a network of over 180 branches.
