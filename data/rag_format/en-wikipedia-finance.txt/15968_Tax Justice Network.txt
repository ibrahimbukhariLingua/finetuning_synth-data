The **Tax Justice Network** (**TJN**) is a British advocacy group consisting of a coalition of researchers and activists with a shared concern about tax avoidance, tax competition, and tax havens.


## Activity


### Research

The TJN has reported on the OECD Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) projects and conducted their own research that the scale of corporate taxes being avoided by multinationals is an estimated $660 billion in 2012 (a quarter of US multinationals’ gross profits), which is equivalent to 0.9% of World GDP.

In July 2012, following a study into wealthy individuals with offshore accounts, the Tax Justice Network published claims regarding deposits worth at least $21 trillion (£13 trillion), potentially even $32 trillion, in secretive tax havens. As a result, governments suffer a lack of income taxes of up to $280 billion.

In November 2020, the TJN published "The State of Tax Justice 2020" report. It claims $427 billion is lost every year to tax abuse.


### Financial Secrecy Index

The Financial Secrecy Index is a biennial publication of the TJN which was started in 2009 and was last released in February 2020. It covers 133 global jurisdictions and produces a "Secrecy Indicator" score for each based on 20 qualitative criteria. Releases are widely covered in the media.


### Corporate Tax Haven Index

The Corporate Tax Haven Index is a biennial publication of the TJN which had its inaugural publication in May 2019. It covers 64 global jurisdictions and produces a "Corporate Tax Haven Index" value by combining two core measures; first a "Haven Score" based on 20 mostly tax related criteria, second a "Global Scale Weight" showing the scale of activity. Release are widely covered in the media.


### Publicity

Experts of TJN appeared at public hearings of the Finance Committee of the German Bundestag in 2016.
