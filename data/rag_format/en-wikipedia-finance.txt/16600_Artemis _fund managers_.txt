Artemis (fund managers)


# Artemis (fund managers)



**Artemis** and its subsidiary **Artemis Fund Managers** are a UK–based fund management business, offering a range of funds which invest in the UK, Europe, the US and the rest of the world.

Artemis' client investments are spread across a range of funds, two investment trusts, a venture capital trust, and both pooled and segregated institutional portfolios.


## History

Artemis was founded in 1997. In 2002 a majority stake was acquired by ABN AMRO; that stake subsequently passed to Fortis.
Following a management buyout in 2010, Artemis is owned by Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) and the Artemis partners. This is a financial partnership: AMG does not get involved in the day-to-day running of the business.

Artemis is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) and has 29 partners, comprising fund managers and other key individuals at the firm. The founders have said that one of the key determinants in long-term success is the stability of the investment team.
