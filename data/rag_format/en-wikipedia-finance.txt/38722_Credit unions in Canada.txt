Credit unions in Canada


# Credit unions in Canada



Canada has significant per-capita membership in credit unions, representing more than a third of the working-age population. Credit union membership is largest in Quebec, where they are known as *caisses populaires* (people's banks), and in western Canada.


## Legislation

Responsibility for the incorporation and regulation of credit unions resides primarily at the provincial and territorial level in Canada. Credit union legislation exists in every province of Canada but does not currently exist in the three northern territories. Credit unions and *caisses populaires* operate in every province of Canada. In Quebec, *caisses populaires* are required to be formally federated with the Caisses Populaires Desjardins.


## Federally regulated credit unions

Legislation was adopted under the federal Bank Act in 2012 to allow for the creation of federal credit unions. On July 1, 2016, the Caisse populaire acadienne ltée (later rebranded as UNI Financial Cooperation), with its 155,000 members, became the first federal credit union in Canada. Coast Capital Savings announced the approval from OSFI to become the second federally regulated credit union in Canada beginning on November 1, 2018, the first federal credit union based in British Columbia. Innovation Federal Credit Union became the first federal credit union headquartered in Saskatchewan on June 23, 2023.
