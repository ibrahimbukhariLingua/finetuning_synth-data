Alamata (woreda)


# Alamata (woreda)



**Alamata** (Tigrinya: ኣላማጣ) is a woreda in Tigray Region, Ethiopia. Part of the Debubawi Zone, Alamata is bordered on the south and west by the Amhara Region, on the northwest by Ofla, and on the northeast by Raya Azebo. Towns in Alamata include Waja. The city of Alamata is a separate entity and is surrounded by Alamata woreda.


## Overview

Distinguished by small, undulating mountains with low vegetation cover, Alamata has an altitude which ranges between 1178 and 3148 meters above sea level, which drain into the Alamata Valley. Eight of the peasant associations are located in the Valley, while two are located in the intermediate highlands which have elevations ranging between 1500 and 3148 meters.

One micro-finance institution operates in Alamata, the Dedebit Credit and Saving Institution SC (DSCI), with three sub-branches: one at the administrative center, another at Waja, and the third at Merewa kebele. DSCI has about 10,000 customers here. There are 11 multipurpose cooperatives in this woreda, one for each kebele and the last located in Alamata; all but one have been organized and registered in accordance with the new cooperatives law, with about 3,541 members. In addition to these cooperatives, there are 4 saving and credit cooperatives, all of which are based in rural areas, and 2 construction cooperatives which are based in the urban areas.

This woreda was one of the about fifteen most important cotton production areas in Ethiopia in the 1950s, excluding Eritrea. A joint Ministry of Agriculture-ICA project to improve cotton production in the Alamata district happened in 1954-55. The zonal water, mining and energy department announced 15 August 2009 that 84 of the 100 wells planned in Alamata and Raya Azebo woredas have been completed at a cost of 40 million Birr. These wells would assist in irrigating over 3,000 hectares of land and benefit over 13,000 farmers.


## Demographics

The population comprises several ethnic groups: (1) Tigrayans, occupying the major part of the woreda, (2) Oromo form an ancient population group in the Raya graben that has been partly assimilated to the surrounding Amhara – the language is not anymore used on a daily basis; they live in dispersed villages across the wider area between Alamata, Mohoni and Chercher, (3) Afar share settlements on the mountains east of Raya, (4), generally living south of the Gobu River. In major towns along the main road, Amharic is frequently used as trade language.

The Tigraians and assimilated Oromos on the escarpments and in the Raya graben are mainly engaged in smallholder agriculture, often using spate irrigation with floods from the escarpment. In recent years they have started dry season irrigation agriculture, stimulated by government-established groundwater pumps and by mimicking commercial farms that have been attracted. Settlements are mainly along roads and iron roofed. Amhara and Tigraians are dominantly Orthodox Christians, though some villages follow Islam, such as some villages in the Raya graben bottom.
The nearby Afar pastoralists practice transhumance, during drought periods, to remote areas, especially to the escarpment and highlands of Region Amhara. Movements to the Tigray uplands allow the Afar pastoralists to herd their livestock on denser vegetation as well as on standing stubble of croplands.
