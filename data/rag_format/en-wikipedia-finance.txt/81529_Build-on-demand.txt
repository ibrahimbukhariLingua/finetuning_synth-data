Build-on-demand


# Build-on-demand



**Build-on-demand** or **manufacturing on demand** (**MOD**) refers to a manufacturing process where goods are produced only when or as they are required. This allows scalability and adjustable assemblies depending on the current needs of the part requestor or client.

Manufacturing on demand has the potential to markedly affect the manufacturing industry by shortening lead times and reducing costs. Manufacturing previously relied on Request for quotes (RfQs) that were not digitally obtainable.
