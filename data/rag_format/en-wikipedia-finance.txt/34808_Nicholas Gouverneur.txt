**Nicholas Gouverneur** (1753 – July 12, 1802) was an American merchant with Gouverneur & Kemble and banker who served as the president of the Bank of New York.


## Early life

Gouverneur was born in 1753. He was the son of Samuel Gouverneur (1720–1778), a merchant, and Experience (née Johnson) Gouverneur (1720–1788). Among his siblings were Gertrude Gouverneur (the wife of Peter Kemble Jr.), and Margaret Gouverneur (the wife of Lewis Ogden), Hannah Gouverneur (the wife of Charles Ogden), and Mary Gouverneur (the wife of the Rev. Uzal Ogden). Margaret, Hannah, and Mary all married brothers, direct descendants of colonist John Ogden.

His paternal grandparents were Isaac Gouverneur (brother of Speaker of the Assembly Abraham Gouverneur) and Sarah (née Staats) Gouverneur (a daughter of Dr. Samuel Staats and granddaughter of Abraham Staats). Among his extended family was uncle Nicolas Gouverneur, and aunt Gertrude Gouverneur Ogden (wife of jurist David Ogden), through whom he was a first cousin of Abraham Ogden and Samuel Ogden. Through his sister, Gertrude Gouverneur Kemble, he was uncle to U.S. Representative Gouverneur Kemble and Gertrude Kemble (wife of Secretary of the Navy James Kirke Paulding).


## Career

Like his father and grandfather before him, Gouverneur was a prominent merchant. Their firm, Gouverneur & Kemble, conducted trade in the West Indies, Europe and China. It had been founded by his grandfather, Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, who "were among the foremost merchants in New York".

After the death of Gulian Verplanck in 1799, he was elected to succeed Verplanck as the president of the Bank of New York (which had been founded by Alexander Hamilton and of which Verplanck had been president for eight years). Gouverneur served as president until his own death in July 1802.

On February 25, 1790, Gouverneur was married to Hester Kortright (1770–1842), a daughter of wealthy merchant Lawrence Kortright and Hannah (née Aspinwall) Kortright. Among her siblings was the future First Lady Elizabeth Kortright Monroe. Together, they were the parents of three sons and three daughters:

* Nicholas Gouverneur II (1792–1854), who died without issue.
* Isaac Gouverneur (c. 1794–1815), who was killed in a duel by lawyer William Homer Maxwell.
