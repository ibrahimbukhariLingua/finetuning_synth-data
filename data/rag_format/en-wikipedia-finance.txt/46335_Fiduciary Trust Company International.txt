## History

In 1931, Fiduciary Trust Company of New York opened for business on the 30th floor at One Wall Street in New York City. The firm was founded as a multi-family office to serve wealthy individuals and families during the financial crisis of the time. Pierre Jay, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve of New York, and Elihu Root Jr., a noted lawyer and son of the Secretary of State, served among the firm's first directors.

By the 1960s, the firm had broadened its reach and as a result opened its first international office in London in 1961 to concentrate on the research and analysis of non-U.S. companies.

The firm continued to evolve and in 1981 opened a Los Angeles office to reach the Western and Southwestern U.S. markets. As a reflection of the firm's global presence, the company changed its name in 1987 from Fiduciary Trust Company of New York to Fiduciary Trust Company International. Starting in the 1990s, the firm saw significant growth. The firm opened an investment management office in Washington, D.C., and was granted a Cayman trust company charter in 1990, and then in 1992 formed Fiduciary Trust Company International of the South, a subsidiary created by acquiring the Miami-based Trust Company of the South. This gave the firm trust powers in Florida. By 1998, the firm had also formed Fiduciary Trust International of Delaware.

In 2001, Fiduciary Trust was acquired by San Mateo, California–based Franklin Resources, Inc. With the acquisition by Franklin, Fiduciary Trust continued to grow its presence on the west coast with the opening of a San Mateo office.

On September 11, 2001, the company had offices on floors 90, 94–97 on the South Tower of the World Trade Center. After the first plane strike on the North Tower at 8:46 a.m., many employees chose to evacuate, but many were still in the building when the second plane hit floors 77–85 of the South Tower at 9:03 a.m. Following the collapse of South Tower at 9:59 a.m., 97 employees and contractors were lost that day. The company relocated to Rockefeller Center after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Fiduciary Trust International of the South continued to grow its presence in South Florida with the opening of an office in Boca Raton in 2013. Two years later, in 2015, Fiduciary Trust Company International of the South relocated its Miami headquarters to 2 Alhambra Plaza in Coral Gables. Then, in 2016, Fiduciary Trust moved its New York headquarters to 280 Park Avenue.
