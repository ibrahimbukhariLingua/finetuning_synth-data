## History

Patelco Credit Union once served an organization formerly known as Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company (now known as AT&T). However, in 1983 it opened its doors to the public and now operates 37 branches in Northern California. It provides services in the form of deposits, lending, investments, and insurance.

Starting June 29th, 2024, Patelco has been experiencing a ransomware attack, causing a partial service outage. It's started to provide daily updates in its Security Incident Updates & Information Center.
