World Confederation of Businesses


# World Confederation of Businesses



The **World Confederation of Businesses** (**WORLDCOB**) is an American business organization that awards the annual Bizz Awards and other certifications. It is the awarding body of the Bizz Awards, founded in 2005 with an annual awards ceremony hosted in three different cities each year, one for Europe, one for Americas, and the one for the region of Asia, Middle East and Africa.

Worldcob's Bizz Award has been criticized several times with the accusation that it is simply a vanity award. The general accusations are that Worldcob randomly contacts many small and medium enterprises telling them that they've been nominated and that, for a fee the company will be given the Bizz Award.


## History
