TX Group


# TX Group



**TX Group AG** (formerly Tamedia AG) is a media company headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Through a portfolio of daily and weekly newspapers, magazines and digital platforms, as well as own printing facilities, it is the largest media group in the country. Since 2000, Tamedia has been listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange.

On January 1, 2020, Tamedia was renamed to TX Group AG. Aside from group management functions, TX Group has four operating companies: TX Markets, Goldbach, 20 Minuten, and Tamedia. The reuse of the Tamedia name for a subsidiary company, combined with reshuffling of brands, does create confusion.


## Marketshare

In 2011, it was the biggest player in the Swiss press market, controlling a 41% market share, which rose up to 68% in French-speaking Romandie. Its main competitors are NZZ-Mediengruppe [de] and Ringier.
