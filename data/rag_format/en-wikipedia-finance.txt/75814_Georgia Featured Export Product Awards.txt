# Georgia Featured Export Product Awards



The annual **Georgia Featured Export Product Awards** are a collaborative presentation by the Georgia Department of Economic Development and the Annual Georgia European Union Summit (AGEUS). The awards are presented in Macon, Georgia, United States at the yearly meeting of AGEUS. The awards began in 2007 with the first presentation of the awards on November 8 at the yearly meeting of AGEUS.

The awards honor small or medium-sized companies with the most potential for creating employment in Georgia through the export of a unique product made in Georgia.

Only those companies with 150 employees or less, or with annual sales of $50 million or less, qualify to compete for the awards. Companies are evaluated based on their product innovation, market potential and international export efforts.
