# Bolt (company)



**Bolt** is an Estonian mobility company that offers ride-hailing, micromobility rental, food and grocery delivery (via the Bolt Food app), and carsharing services. The company is headquartered in Tallinn and operates in over 500 cities in more than 45 countries in Europe, Africa, Western Asia and Latin America. The company has more than 150 million customers and more than 3 million driver and courier partners. The company has plans for an initial public offering in 2025.


## History

The company was founded in 2013 as Taxify by Markus Villig, then a 19-year-old high-school student. Markus built the prototype of the app while personally recruiting drivers on the streets of Tallinn after receiving a €5000 loan from his family.

The service was launched in Tallinn, Estonia in August 2013, and by 2014, it was operating abroad. In April 2017, it expanded to Baku and Malta. In September 2017, Bolt launched its services in London by acquiring a local taxi company, but was suspended by Transport for London due to licensing issues. In February 2018, the company filed a new licence application and relaunched in London in June 2019. In October 2017, it expanded to Paris. In April 2018, it reached 10 million global users. In March 2019, the company changed its name from Taxify to Bolt. In August 2019, the company launched Bolt Food, a food delivery service in Tallinn. It has since expanded to over 80 cities across 20 countries with over 30,000 restaurants using the platform. In September 2021, Bolt launched a grocery delivery service, Bolt Market.

In November 2024, Bolt lost a legal challenge in the UK Employment Tribunal over the employment status of its drivers. The Tribunal ruled that Bolt’s drivers qualify as “workers” rather than self-employed independent contractors, as Bolt had argued. This classification means that drivers are entitled to employment benefits, including minimum wage protections. The case was brought by approximately 10,000 current and former drivers seeking minimum wage pay and other employment benefits. Lawyers representing the drivers estimate that Bolt could face a financial liability exceeding £200 million as a result of this decision.


## Financing

Prior to announcing a partnership with Didi Chuxing, Bolt had raised over €2 million in investment capital from Estonian and Finnish angel investors. In August 2017, Didi Chuxing invested an undisclosed amount believed to be an "eight-figure U.S. dollar sum". A May 2018 funding round with a $175 million investment from Daimler, Didi and others led to a 1 billion dollar valuation for the company, making it a unicorn.

In January 2020, the European Investment Bank signed a EUR 50 million venture debt facility with Bolt. The financing, supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), is to boost Bolt's product development in areas where technology can improve the safety, reliability and sustainability of its services. This includes investment in existing services such as vehicle for hire and food delivery, as well as the development of new products.

In December 2020, Bolt raised €150 million from venture capital investment funds. In March 2021, Bolt raised €20 million from International Finance Corporation, a World Bank Group member, for further expansion in emerging markets. The company was valued at more than €2 billion after this fund raising round. In August 2021, Bolt raised €600 million from Sequoia Capital increasing the valuation of the company to over €4 billion. As of 2021, Didi Chuxing was no longer an investor in Bolt. In January 2022, Bolt raised €628 million from investors led by Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management and Research Co, taking the company's valuation to €7.4 billion.

It had 1,500 car-sharing vehicles in Vilnius 18 months after launch. Bolt's car-sharing service in Vilnius costs from 0.05 euros per minute for Audi Q2 and Peugeot 208.


## Other products


### Self-driving cars

In August 2019, Bolt and the University of Tartu announced a partnership on an applied research project to develop technology for self-driving cars. In April 2021, Bolt and the University of Tartu expanded their cooperation on the AV project, signing a new 5-year agreement designed to further develop the technical capabilities of the university's autonomous driving lab in the areas of artificial intelligence and maps and algorithms.


### Grocery delivery service

In 2021, Bolt launched grocery delivery service in the Baltic States. It later expanded to Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland and elsewhere. Bolt plans to eventually deliver groceries with self-driving robots, in partnership with Starship Technologies.


## Controversies

In 2025, concerns were raised about Bolt’s lack of email verification and data security practices. An investigation confirmed that Bolt allows multiple registrations using the same email, enabling potential identity misuse. Affected users reported receiving detailed ride notifications for accounts they never created, raising privacy risks. Bolt’s own article, “Receiving Bolt emails without having an account”, confirms that anyone can enter any email during registration, and that address will receive trip details without verification. Despite multiple reports, Bolt’s customer support failed to respond, drawing criticism for negligence and lack of accountability.
