# Woo Media



**Woo Media** was an online chat and video social network which offered a variety of interactive sites that provided live social entertainment through a computer or mobile device.
The company raised $17 million in venture capital from several investors including Index Ventures, Atomico (founded by Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis), Mangrove Capital Partners, and Klaus Hommels. One analyst valued Woo Media at $41 million at the time it was funded. Online dating company Zoosk purchased Woo Media in November 2011. Zoosk purchased Woo Media for its properties’ commercial traction and for access to its 10 million active users.


## Overview

Woo Media was created by Stephen Stokols, an American entrepreneur, technologist and executive in 2007 after a conversation with his sister about the difficulties using an online dating service. Stokols had been working on new web based video technologies and used it to launch Woo Media’s first property, WooMe.com. Previously, Stokols served as the Vice President of new revenue opportunities at BT Group where he was responsible for evaluating applications of browser-based voice and video technologies.

Upon launching the website at TechCrunch40 in 2007, the founding product, WooMe had an initial 1,000 users. The site’s user base grew to 1,000,000 users in the first twelve months. The site has since been featured in *The Guardian*, *Financial Times*, *The New York Times*, *TechCrunch*, *Metro.co.uk*, *Times Online*, *Mashable*, *Businessweek*, *Wired* and *PC Magazine*. Stokols grew the organization from 5 employees in 2007 to over 60 in 2011.

The company broadened its focus over the past 5 years and, at the time of its sale, included additional websites of various interactive video experiences including one on one online chat experience (WooMe.com), reality TV online video (WooMe.tv), peer-to-peer video chat (ShufflePeople.com), and social group video chat (MonsterChat.com). The Woo Media network had over 10 million active users with an average of 20 thousand registrants per day at the time of the sale to Zoosk.
