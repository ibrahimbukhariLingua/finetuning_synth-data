The **Kemble Building** was an eight-story edifice located at 15â€“25 Whitehall Street between Bridge Street and Stone Street. It stood opposite the Custom House in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City. Owned by the Ogden Goelet Estate, the structure adjoined the seven-story New York Produce Exchange Building. At first employed as a cotton warehouse, it was used for office space beginning in 1882. Prior to the Kemble Building's erection, the site was occupied by the business of Hendrick Willemsen, a baker and bread inspector.

During January 1886, room 34 of the Kemble Building was occupied by the Pennock Underground Telegraph Company.

A college graduate, who was a grammar school instructor, advertised for pupils to tutor in the afternoons or evenings in September 1886.

In June 1890 the structure hosted a meeting of wholesale liquor dealers. They met to consider possible action against arbitrary measures taken by the Whiskey Trust.

The Mary H. Packer, a schooner rigged steam ship weighing ninety-seven tons, was owned by a Mr. White, whose office was in the Kemble Building in October 1892.
