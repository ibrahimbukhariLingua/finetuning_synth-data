**Patrick Dumont** (born 1974 or 1975 (citation needed)) is an American businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association.

After his 2009 marriage to Sivan Ochshorn, daughter of Miriam Adelson, in 2009, Dumont entered the Las Vegas Sands Corp, rising to Chief Financial Officer in 2016 and President and Chief Operating Officer in 2021.

In 2023, the Adelson-Dumont family purchased the majority controlling interest in the Mavericks, with Dumont becoming the team's governor, replacing Mark Cuban.


## Early life and career

Dumont grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Johns Hopkins University and an MBA from Columbia Business School.


## Business career

Dumont's early career was in investment banking. He worked at Miller Buckfire and Bear Stearns.

After his marriage to Ochshorn, Dumont joined the Adelsons' company Las Vegas Sands Corp, which operates resorts in Singapore and Macau, in June 2010. He served in a variety of strategy, operating, and finance positions, rising to senior vice president before being named the company's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in March 2016.

In 2015, Dumont brokered the deal for Sheldon Adelson to purchase the newspaper *Las Vegas Review-Journal* for $140 million in his role overseeing the Adelson family's investments.

After the death of Sheldon Adelson on January 11, 2021, Dumont was elevated to president and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Las Vegas Sands Corp, positioning him as the heir to the family's gambling empire.


## Dallas Mavericks

The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale of the controlling ownership interest of the Dallas Mavericks to Miriam Adelson and Sivan and Patrick Dumont on December 27, 2023. Dumont became the Mavericks' governor and representative to the NBA Board of Governors. The Adelson-Dumont families' would own 69% of the team, and previous controlling owner Mark Cuban's share was reduced to 27%. Dumont's low profile was contrasted with that of the big persona and pop culture visibility of previous majority owner Cuban.

According to the *Dallas Morning News*, the Adelson-Dumont family's purchase of the Dallas Mavericks was the realization of a decade-long passion to buy an NBA franchise. Long-term, Dumont expressed the potential to develop destination resorts in Texas, including the opportunity to build a new arena for the Mavericks as part of a large-scale entertainment complex in a destination resort.

In late 2024, Dumont played a pivotal role in thawing relations between the NBA and China, which frayed following Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. Dumont announced the NBA China Games, to be held at the Venetian Arena in Macao in October 2025.

Dumont was the "ultimate decision maker" of the controversial blockbuster trade of star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers on February 1, 2025, according to Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison. In his first public comments since the trade on February 9, Dumont backed the trade, stating: "If you look at the greats in the league, the people you and I grew up with, Jordan, Bird, Kobe, Shaq, they worked really hard, every day, with a singular focus to win. And if you don’t have that, it doesn’t work. And if you don’t have that, you shouldn’t be part of the Dallas Mavericks." He also made clear there were no plans to relocate the team away from Dallas.


## Personal life

Dumont married Sivan Ochshorn, Miriam Adelson's second daughter from her first marriage, in 2009.
