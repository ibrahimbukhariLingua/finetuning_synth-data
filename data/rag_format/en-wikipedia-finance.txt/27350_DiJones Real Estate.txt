DiJones Real Estate


# DiJones Real Estate



**DiJones Real Estate** is an Australian real estate group specialising in residential and commercial sales and property management. The company operates from 21 offices in Sydney, Central Coast, Southern Highlands and Illawarra districts of New South Wales.


## History

DiJones was founded by female entrepreneur Diane Lenore Jones. Jones was married to Bill Jones, an auctioneer at LJ Hooker Real Estate. When her son Matthew was born with disabilities and needed extra help she made the decision to go out to work to fund the care. Several years later in an interview she said "If not for Matthew's illness, I'd probably have remained a housewife." She worked at two other real estate businesses before she founded Jones & Jones Pty Ltd trading as DiJones Real Estate in 1992.

Jones found that there was an unconscious gender bias favourable to her when engaging with female clients. At the time in Australia there were few female estate agents so Jones decided to set up her own female owned and operated agency, encouraged by those who kept telling her how much they liked her "female touch". This was a first for the Australian real estate industry.

Diane Lenore Jones died in 2018 from pulmonary disease.


## Innovation

Di Jones was the first Australian company to offer home staging services. From the inception of the company in 1992 DiJones introduced the idea of stylists presenting homes.

The first virtual property tours in Australia were sold and published by DiJones. In September 1998 the company launched a service where, for a $70 fee, a vendor could have their property posted on the Web site with a virtual tour. The company was the first Australian real estate agency to live stream a real estate auction via their website.

DiJones published the First residential property "Market Report". In response to the international interest in Sydney real estate prices as a result of the upcoming Sydney Olympics, in November 1999. The format of the report beginning with an assessment of the current economic conditions, an analysis of current property prices and concluding with a section devoted to "potential boom areas" is a reporting format that has become commonplace today by publishers such as CoreLogic and other real estate business data companies.


## Philanthropy

The business has always supported groups enacting female empowerment and gender equality in Australian society. As early as 1995 the business was supporting the Refugee Council of Australia Women's Literacy Projectin a commitment to provide resources needed for refugee women arriving in Australia to become effective leaders.

Other regular philanthropic recipients are St Vincents Hospital Sydneyand a variety of school and disability organisations.
