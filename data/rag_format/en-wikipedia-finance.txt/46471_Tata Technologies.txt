## History

Tata Technologies was founded in 1989, as the automotive design unit of Tata Motors. It was hived off as a separate company in 1994, with Tata Motors continuing to hold a majority stake and be its biggest client.

Tata Technologies Inc acquired INCAT International, a UK-and US-based automotive and aerospace engineering company, in August 2005 for £53.4 million.

In 2011, Tata Technologies raised ₹141 crore (US$30 million) by selling 13% stake to Tata Capital and Alpha TC Holdings.

In April 2013, Tata Technologies acquired Cambric Corporation, an American engineering services company, for $32.5 million.

In May 2017, Tata Technologies acquired 100% stake in Swedish automotive design and product engineering company, Escenda Engineering AB.

In 2017, in an effort to reduce Tata Motors' debt, the Tata Group announced that it would sell a 43% stake in Tata Technologies to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $360 million and cease to be the controlling shareholder in the company. However, the deal was called off in 2018.

In November 2023, Tata Technologies launched its book-built initial public offering (IPO) selling shares worth ₹3,042 crore (US$360 million), making it Tata Group's first public offering in nearly two decades. Its shares began trading on NSE and BSE on 30 November 2023.
