**Frank S. Jorga** (30 December 1968) is a German businessman and investor. He pioneered the online video identification system. He is the founder and managing director of WebID Solutions.


## Education and career

After initially establishing an IT company with his brother, Jorga transitioned into banking, pursued studies in business administration and law, and completed his Master of Business Administration. Following his second Staatsexamen in law, he joined the German-American Chamber of Commerce and worked as a consultant for various companies in Silicon Valley.

After his return to Germany, Jorga worked on the liquidation of the merger of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. As Head of Strategy and Digital at GFKL Financial Services AG, Jorga launched a process that enabled online stores to offer purchase on account, credit, and direct debit. At the beginning of the 2010s, Jorga considered developing an alternative to Deutsche Post's analogue *PostIdent* procedure, which so far required new customers of banks and brokers to attend in person to verify their identity.

In 2012, Jorga founded WebID Solutions. After proceedings with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Jorga obtained approval for the identification via video chat procedure he invented in January 2014. Under his management, WebID Solutions developed additional identification procedures, such as authentication of online identities.

With the expansion into Spain in 2023, Jorga became CEO of WebID Spain. Later that year, the city of Wiesbaden introduced online changing of address through video identification based on WebID's software, as a follow-up project to the digital registration for marriage in 2021.


## Personal life

Jorga is originally from LÃ¼beck and lives in Hamburg and Berlin. He has been married since late 2023.
