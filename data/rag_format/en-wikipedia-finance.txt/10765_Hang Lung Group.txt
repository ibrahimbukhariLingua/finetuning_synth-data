## History

Hang Lung Group was founded by T.H. Chan on 13 September 1960 and is now one of Hong Kong's biggest real estate developers. For the first 32 years, the group operated its business mainly in Hong Kong. It became well known by developing the largest residential complexes along the Mass Transit Railway. The Hong Kong market suffered from a temporary collapse during the early 1980s owing to uncertainty surrounding the territory's return to China, but Hang Lung survived the turmoil. The group operates businesses in property development for sale and lease in Hong Kong. Its investment properties are diversified, ranging from retail and residential developments to industrial and office complexes.

In 1988, it gained control of Parry Corporation in Australia. On 1 January 1991, Ronnie Chan took over as the group's chairman. He foresaw the opportunity to invest in the mainland China market owing to its rapid economic growth. Its first step into the mainland, in Shanghai in 1992, was with two landmark properties, Plaza 66 and Grand Gateway 66. Following the success of its Shanghai projects, the group continued to expand its business to other parts of the mainland such as Shenyang, Jinan, Wuxi, Tianjin, Dalian, Kunming, and Wuhan.
