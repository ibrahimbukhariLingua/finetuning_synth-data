## History


### Foundation

Central Sunbelt was originally chartered as the Masonite Employees Federal Credit Union on October 16, 1953. Masonite, a wood product fabricated for production of doors, roofing, walls, and house siding, was invented in Laurel, Mississippi, in 1924 by William H. Mason, a friend to Thomas Edison. Mass production of masonite began shortly after 1929 and the size of the company quickly grew with the demands of the masonite product. The employees of Masonite soon found the need for a financial institution to service the needs of the growing employee base and established a federally chartered credit union on October 16, 1963.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Expansion

Within twenty years, the credit union that once began to serve a single company's employee base was now a financial institution serving a large part of the growing community. The board of directors found it necessary to update the name of Masonite Employees Federal Credit Union to better adapt to the growing membership base. The credit union name changed January 1, 1983, to Central Sunbelt Federal Credit Union, as the result of expanding the field of membership to include other employee groups. In May 1991, Central Sunbelt aimed to fit the growing needs of the membership base with a second branch in the neighboring City of Hattiesburg. Soon after, a second office in Laurel was established on Sawmill Road in April 1995. A fourth branch was constructed on Lincoln Road in Hattiesburg in July 2000. In July, 2012, a fifth location was built to service McComb, in Pike County) as Central Sunbelt merged in Pike County Teachers Federal Credit Union. In January 2015, Central Sunbelt launched a new branch in Waynesboro, the seat of Wayne County, Mississippi.
