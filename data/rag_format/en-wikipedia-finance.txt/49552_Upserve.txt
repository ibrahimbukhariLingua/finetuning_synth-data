# Upserve



**Upserve**, originally **Swipely**, provides a restaurant management platform which allows independent full-service restaurants to run and manage their entire business. The Platform is made up of restaurant-specific point of sale (POS) software, payments, and analytics, online ordering, loyalty, and marketing tools designed specifically for restaurants. At the center of the Upserve Platform is the cloud-based Upserve POS, a point of sale system that Upserve acquired from Groupon in 2016.

In 2013, *Forbes* magazine included Swipely in its list of the top 100 “America’s Most Promising Companies.” Upserve's former CEO, Angus Davis, was named to Forbes list of “America’s Most Promising CEOs Under 35.” In 2017, Upserve received a nine-figure investment from Vista Equity Partners to accelerate the platform's growth.


## History and services

Upserve, formerly Swipely, was founded in 2009 by Angus Davis, the co-founder of Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2007. Swipely was formerly a social network in which members shared their purchases with friends.

In February 2011, Swipely evolved into a loyalty platform for local merchants to reward repeat customers. In 2016, Swipely acquired Breadcrumb POS from Groupon and re-branded to Upserve in order to reflect its offering of a comprehensive management system for the restaurant industry.

In 2017, Upserve expanded its Restaurant Management Platform by offering integrated online ordering through a partnership with Grubhub, as well as its own online ordering solution. In 2018, Upserve partnered with Resy to produce an industry-first POS integration to streamline reservations and table management. Additionally, it introduced Upserve Marketplace, which is a curated hub of integrated restaurant technology for its customers to tie together disparate systems.

In 2020, Upserve was acquired by Lightspeed.
