Helloworld Travel


# Helloworld Travel



**Helloworld Travel** is an Australian-based travel agency specialising in Retail, Corporate and Wholesale travel products and packages. Helloworld Travel is the retail travel business of Helloworld Travel Limited (HLO), with fully branded travel agencies and associate agents located throughout Australia and New Zealand.


## History

Helloworld Travel was previously known as "Helloworld". It was a group of franchised travel agencies based in Australia. It is one of the oldest travel agencies in Australia. Since opening its first office in May 1951, it has expanded to over 500 agencies throughout Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

In 2013, Harvey World Travel's parent company, Jetset Travelworld Group (JTG), rebranded the agencies as Helloworld Travel in Australia and New Zealand, as part of a major overhaul that also included JTG being rebranded as Helloworld Ltd. The original brand remains in use in South Africa.

The organization has been through a series of mergers and acquisitions in recent history, amalgamating existing organizations within its parent company Helloworld Travel Limited.

During the re-brand, the size of the network decreased by 9 percent in 2014 and 2 percent in 2015 due to franchisees being unhappy with the decision.


## Controversies

In February 2019 media reports revealed that Helloworld had paid for Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann's flights for a family holiday to Singapore in 2017, within weeks of two Helloworld subsidiaries being awarded contracts to arrange around AUD$1 billion worth of airline and hotel bookings for the Australian government over three years. Reports further revealed that the Australian Ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, had in April 2017 told Washington embassy staff to meet with an executive from Helloworld. Shortly afterwards, an email from former Helloworld executive Russell Carstensen was tabled in the Australian Senate. The email stated that Helloworld CEO, Andrew Burnes, told him he was able to arrange a meeting on very short notice because Hockey 'owes' him.

The Senate was also told that the senior Finance department official in charge of negotiating a new contract with Helloworld, John Sheridan, was moved from his role in July 2017, after Burnes had complained to Senator Cormann and then to the Finance Department head about Sheridan's team's emphasis on savings from the travel contract. Burnes is Treasurer of, and a significant donor to, the Liberal Party of Australia, Hockey and Cormann's party.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
