According to TechCrunch, Scripted has a pool of 80,000 freelancers as of November 2011, with 80% of those writers U.S. based.


## History

Scripted is administered by co-founders CEO Sunil Rajaraman and CFO Ryan Buckley. Before officially changing their focus from screenwriting to freelance writing in November 2011, Rajaraman and Buckley founded Scripped in 2008, an online company specializing in screenplay services. On March 29, 2010, Scripped announced a merger with screenwriting competitor Zhura. Rajaraman remained the merged company's Chief Executive Officer. Then, in May 2011, Rajaraman and Buckley launched offshoot site Scripted.com. In November 2011, it started with $700,000 in seed funding from investors Crosslink Capital, Shopzilla CIO Jody Mulkey, and LiveOps founder Douglas Feirstein. In February 2012, a new seed financing round resulted in an additional $150,000 led by former Redpoint Ventures Executive-in-Residence David Wu. The company recently partnered with Dana Brunetti and Kevin Spaceyâ€™s company Trigger Street Productions to introduce its new publishing website ShowWatcher. In June 2013, Scripted raised $4.5 million from Redpoint, Crosslink.
