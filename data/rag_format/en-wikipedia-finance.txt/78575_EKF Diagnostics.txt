## History

EKF Diagnostics began as EKF-Diagnostic GmbH when it was founded in 1990 by Berthold Walter in Barleben near Magdeburg, Germany. Initially an engineering business, the company made a slow transition during the 1990s to a medical diagnostics company when they started developing analysers for blood banks, diabetes and sports medicine markets as well as acquiring other companies in the field.

2010 was a year of major change for the company. EKF-Diagnostic GmbH was acquired by International Brand Licensing, a UK AIM-listed company which was soon renamed to EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc. EKF Diagnostics then began acquiring companies in the diagnostics field. Quotient Diagnostics based in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey was the first, it was acquired by EKF Diagnostics in October 2010 for £3.41 million. This acquisition added a range of diagnostic devices to aid the treatment and management of diabetes and associated chronic disease to EKF Diagnostics' portfolio. Two months later EKF Diagnostics bought Argutus Medical for £2.2 million. The acquisition of Argutus Medical expanded EKF Diagnostics' product portfolio to include biomarker-based diagnostic ELISA & Rapid tests.

In 2011, EKF Diagnostics acquired Stanbio Laboratory LP, a medical devices distribution and manufacturing business based in Boerne, Texas for US$25.5 million. Stanbio Life Sciences an enzyme production company was also part of this acquisition.
