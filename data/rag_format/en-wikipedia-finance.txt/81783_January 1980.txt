The following events happened in **January 1980**:


## January 1, 1980 (Tuesday)

* A 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Azores at 3:42 in the afternoon local time on the first day of the new decade (1642 UTC), and killed 61 people. Hardest hit by the quake was Terceira Island and its provincial capital, Angra do Heroísmo.
* Forty-eight people at a New Year's party in Canada were killed, and 50 others injured, in the Opémiska Community Hall fire in Chapais, Quebec. At 1:15 in the morning, one of the party goers set fire to a decorative arch, made from dried pine tree branches over the doorway, igniting a blaze that spread to Christmas trees that had been used to decorate the community hall ballroom.
* At 12:01 a.m., Massachusetts became the last of the 50 states of the U.S. to permit drivers to turn right at a red light. Massachusetts changed its law under pressure from the United States Department of Energy, which had threatened to withhold one million dollars in special funds if the state failed to amend its rules to prevent drivers from wasting fuel while idling at a light. The Massachusetts law still allowed municipalities to install a "No Turn on Red" sign at designated intersections, and the *Boston Globe* noted that the state paid for $100,000 worth of new signs "plus unknown installation costs"; within a week, the Department of Public Works estimated that only one-third of intersections in the state allowed a right turn.

* Changes to the Swedish Act of Succession placed Princess Victoria of Sweden first in line to the throne ("heir apparent") and therefore Crown Princess, ahead of her younger brother under the new law of absolute primogeniture. Victoria's daughter, Princess Estelle, is next in line for the throne.
* The Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, a mutual defense pact between the Republic of China (on the island of Taiwan) and the United States, came to an end a little less than 25 years after it had been signed on March 3, 1955, after the U.S. exercised its option for either party to terminate the treaty upon one year's notice. U.S. President Jimmy Carter had given notice on January 1, 1979, upon establishing full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China. The Supreme Court of the United States had declined to review a challenge by U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, arguing that the treaty could not be terminated by a president without congressional approval.
* Five islands that were part of the New Hebrides protectorate attempted to secede to create the Tafea Nation (named for the first initials of the five islands (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango and Aneityum). The United Kingdom would intervene on May 26, 1980, and the New Hebrides would become independent as Vanuatu in July.
* The #1-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes lost to the #3-ranked USC Trojans, 17 to 16, in the Rose Bowl. In the evening, the #2 ranked Alabama Crimson Tide defeated the #6 ranked Arkansas Razorbacks, 24 to 9, in the Sugar Bowl to set up the question of whether the wire service polls would vote the mythical national college football championship to unbeaten Alabama (12-0-0) or to unbeaten but once-tied USC (11-0-1). The vote came the next day in Alabama's favor.
* Richard Petty who won his 7th NASCAR Drivers' Championship was named the 1979 Driver of the Year by the editors of Auto Racing Digest Magazine.

* Both the Associated Press poll of 67 sportswriters and the United Press International poll of 38 coaches agreed that the University of Alabama Crimson Tide was the number one college football team in the United States after the postseason bowl games, which the NCAA acknowledged in the pre-playoff era as the "unofficial college football national champion". In the AP poll, Alabama received more first place votes than the University of Southern California Trojans, 46 to 21 (and 1,317 points to 1,289) and in the UPI poll, the coaches favored Alabama 28 to 9 (and 559 to 539 points), with one vote for the 11-1-0 University of Oklahoma Sooners.

The ten-year loan came with conditions that Chrysler would turn over $162,500,000 of its stock to its employees, in return for hourly workers to forgo $462,500,000 of bargained for wage increases, and white-collar employees yielding $125 million of future raises.

Mendez of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Technical Service provided the fake passports, along with disguise materials and clothing "to match what might be expected of a film crew", and then escorted the six Americans to the Mehrabad Airport.
