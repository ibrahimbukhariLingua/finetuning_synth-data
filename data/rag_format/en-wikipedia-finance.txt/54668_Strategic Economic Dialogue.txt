Strategic Economic Dialogue


# Strategic Economic Dialogue



The **Strategic Economic Dialogue** (**SED**) was a framework for the United States and the People's Republic of China to discuss topics related to economic relations between them.²⁸⁸ The SED was initiated in 2006 by President George W. Bush and President Hu Jintao.²⁸⁸ Top leaders of both countries would meet twice a year at locations alternating between China and the US. Five meetings were held between 2006 and 2008, after which the dialogue was upgraded by the administration of United States President Barack Obama, with the name U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.²⁸⁸

The SED enhanced the economic dialogue efforts which had been occurring since 1983 in the annual meetings of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.²⁸⁷–²⁸⁸ SED became an important mechanism for addressing grievances and evaluating areas of cooperation.²⁸⁸ It was led jointly by the United States Treasury Secretary and the Chinese Vice Premier in charge of trade.²⁸⁸

It had been described by a former U.S. Treasury official as "sort of like the G2". The SED was expanded to give the U.S. State Department a bigger role by the Presidency of Barack Obama, and renamed the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.
