Central Bank of Aruba


# Central Bank of Aruba



The **Central Bank of Aruba** (Papiamento: *Banco Central di Aruba*, Dutch: *Centrale Bank van Aruba*) is the central bank in Aruba responsible for implementation of monetary policy of the Aruban florin.


## History

The Centrale Bank van Aruba (the Bank) started its operations on January 1, 1986, when Aruba obtained its status as an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Prior to this period, Aruba formed part of the Netherlands Antilles under jurisdiction of the Bank of the Netherlands Antilles.

The bank is a legal entity in itself (*sui generis*) with an autonomous position within Aruba's public sector. With the inception of the bank, the Aruban florin was brought into circulation at the same rate as the Netherlands Antillean guilder, pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of Afl. 1.79 (= 1 NAf.) = US$1.00. This exchange rate has remained unchanged since then.

The principle tasks of the bank are to maintain the internal and external value of the florin and to promote the soundness and integrity of the financial system.


## Presidents

The Central Bank of Aruba is currently led by its president Mrs. Jeanette R Semeleer.
