Rotman School of Management


# Rotman School of Management



The **Joseph L. Rotman School of Management** (commonly known as the **Rotman School of Management**, the **Rotman School** or just **Rotman**) is the University of Toronto's graduate business school, located in Downtown Toronto. The University of Toronto has been offering undergraduate courses in commerce and management since 1901, but the business school was formally established in 1950 as the **Institute of Business Administration**. The name was changed to the **Faculty of Management Studies** in 1972 and subsequently shortened to the **Faculty of Management** in 1986. The school was renamed in 1997 after Joseph L. Rotman (1935–2015), its principal benefactor.

The school offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs in business administration, finance and commerce, including full-time, part-time and executive MBA programs along with a Master of Finance program, a Master of Management Analytics, the Master of Financial Risk Management, a Graduate Diploma in Professional Accounting, and a doctoral program.

Additionally, in collaboration with other schools at the university and abroad, it offers combined or joint MBA degrees with the Faculty of Law (JD/MBA), the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering (Skoll BASc/MBA), the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy (PharmD/MBA), the Munk School of Global Affairs (MBA/MGA), the Temerty Faculty of Medicine (MD/MBA); and Collaborative Programs in Asia-Pacific Studies and Environmental Studies.


## History

The programs for which the Rotman School of Management is now responsible had their origins in 1901 when a diploma program in Commerce was inaugurated in the Faculty of Arts. This was transformed into a Bachelor of Arts program in Commerce and Finance in 1909 and into a Bachelor of Commerce program in 1920. These programs had a strong liberal arts emphasis which the BCom program still tries to retain. A Master of Commerce program was started in the Faculty of Arts in 1938 to provide a more professional program.

In 1950 the MCom program was transferred into the newly created Institute of Business Administration with a Director as its head. The degree was changed to Master of Business Administration in 1960 and the institute was renamed the School of Business. It was elevated to the status of a Faculty with a Dean in 1972 and renamed the Faculty of Management Studies. The name was shortened to Faculty of Management in 1986 and was named the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management in 1997 in honour of its principal benefactor. It still, however, retains its status as a Faculty in the University of Toronto.

A Doctor of Philosophy program was begun in 1969 to develop its research orientation and to provide business school faculty for Canadian universities. In 1982 the School assumed responsibility for teaching the Commerce courses within the BCom program and in 1992 the BCom program became a joint program of the Faculty of Arts and Science and of the Rotman School. In 1983 the School began a privately financed Executive MBA program. In 1989 a privately funded MBA in professional accounting was added. In 1996 it was moved to the University of Toronto Mississauga and the degree changed to Master of Management & Professional Accounting. The School also offers a variety of non-degree Executive Development Programs and operates a number of research centres which complement its teaching and research activities.


### Change to Rotman School of Management

In 1995, the Joseph L. Rotman Centre for Management, funded in part by a $3 million donation made by Joseph Rotman in 1993, was opened and the Faculty of Management shifted its base to its current building after previously moving locations multiple times. The center was later expanded with additions to the upper floors along with a new South Building, with the original building now known as the North Building. The school was renamed as the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management in 1997, in honour of a $15 million donation of its principal benefactor, Joseph Rotman, to be paid out over a period of time ending in 2011.

Rotman's donation was particularly controversial, as examined in a 1997 cover story of The Varsity. The donor agreement included several clauses that could limit the university and faculty of management's academic freedom. The agreement required that "U of T [rank] the faculty of management as one of its 'highest priorities' for the allocation of university funding, ensuring to its 'best efforts' that business education receives continuing focus." Bill Graham, then-president of the University of Toronto Faculty Association, was among the most vocal opponents of the original agreement, noted "the unqualified support for the 'vision,' and it talked about non-qualified support for and commitment to the values and principles underlying the 'vision' by the members of the faculty of management, as well as the central administration". The donation agreement underwent some substantial revisions, but the Rotman Foundation retained the right to "bring in an outside expert from the Association of American Universities to recommend policy changes if it was felt that the school of management was failing to live up to the criteria set out in the agreement". The school, however, retains its status as a Faculty in the University of Toronto.

In 1998, former management consultant Roger Martin was appointed Dean of the School, and during his tenure he oversaw the changes mandated by the Rotman Foundation. Martin's high profile and outspokenness caused some conflict with the other University faculties, notwithstanding, he was credited with "[transforming] what was a small, rather inconsequential regional player in Canada into a world-class institution offering a more differentiated MBA program focused around integrative thinking, self-development and business design".

In the year 2000, Marcel Desautels, founder, president and CEO of the Canadian Credit Management Foundation helped in creating Marcel Desautels Centre for Integrative Thinking with a $10-million gift. Rotman developed a new model of business education based on integrative thinking in the same year. The Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship (originally the AIC Institute for Corporate Citizenship) was established at Rotman in 2004 with a $10-million gift from Michael Lee-Chin. The same year, Rotman completed an expansion of its campus. In recent years, the school has received significant funding from private and public quarters.

In 2011, Rotman's academic expenditures were $71 million for 1,500 students (the Faculty of Architecture spent $7 million for 400 students), comparable to that of the University of Toronto Scarborough campus. Part of those costs were attributed to the high salaries paid to faculty, as six of the top 10 salaries paid to University of Toronto employees for 2012 went to Rotman professors and administrators, according to the Ontario Ministry of Finance Public Sector Salary Disclosure ("sunshine list"). Roger Martin, the longtime dean of the school, argued that "It's extremely expensive to have a good business school. So the salaries are higher; in order to get world-class faculty you have to pay those salaries. Student services are greater". The *Financial Times* showed that Rotman graduates saw an average salary increase of slightly over 100 percent after finishing their degrees.

Under Roger Martin's leadership, Rotman saw dramatic growth in the size of its programs, faculty, facilities and international reputation. New programs launched included the Morning MBA program, Master of Finance program and a Global Executive MBA program. In September 2012, a new building expansion was opened, more than doubling the amount of teaching, research, study, presentation and special event space.

Becoming the Dean of the Rotman School in 2014, Tiff Macklem launched of a number of specialized graduate management programs at the School, in financial risk management, professional accounting, management analytics and healthcare. He championed diversity and inclusion, experiential learning and entrepreneurship initiatives, such as the Creative Destruction Lab. A prominent expert on sustainable finance, risk management and public policy, he left Rotman to become governor of the Bank of Canada in June 2020.

Susan Christoffersen began a five-year term as Dean on July 1, 2021. A finance professor at Rotman since 2010, she has also served as Vice-Dean, Undergraduate and Specialized Programs from 2015- 2020 and was known as a curriculum innovator. In 2022, she launched Purpose into Action: Academic Plan 2022-2027 followed by an ambitious new fundraising goal of $250 million as part the University of Toronto's Defy Gravity campaign.

## Campus

Rotman is located in the heart of the University of Toronto's downtown St. George Campus. There are several noteworthy features of the building (completed in 1995) that houses the school:

* The Fleck Atrium is a large area on the main (ground) floor which is often used for special events, receptions, and public lectures. It occupies the central area of the building, with an open-air concept that allows individuals on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the building to observe from above. The vaulted ceiling of the atrium is made from glass, creating a brightness throughout the interior space.
* The Milt Harris Library, formerly known as the Business Information Centre, is a branch of the University of Toronto's library system, and supports the students, faculty and staff of the Rotman School and the Rotman Commerce program.
* The BMO Financial Group Financial Research and Trading Lab is a state-of-the-art facility allowing students access to a wide range of financial analysis software packages and data sets. A variety of business competitions are held in the lab throughout the year. In particular the Rotman International Trading Competition (RITC) is an annual trading competition featuring universities from around the world.
* A CAD $4 million expansion of the building, completed in 2005, added about a dozen new faculty/administrative offices and some meeting rooms to each of the 4th and 5th floors of the building.

To accommodate dramatic growth of the program, the school expanded into a new $91.8-million building designed by KPMB Architects which opened in September 2012. The new building, adjacent to and fully integrated with the existing structure, nearly doubles the size of the facilities to provide more space for research and education. The Rotman expansion includes the Desautels Hall, a 400-seat multipurpose space named after lead philanthropist Marcel Desautels. The hall that can be configured in six ways to suit a range of uses from large examinations and guest speaker series to TED talks and alumni events.
