Soma Oil & Gas


# Soma Oil & Gas



**Soma Oil & Gas Ltd (BVI)** is a private oil company operating offshore oil and gas exploration projects in Somalia. Initially founded as Soma Oil & Gas in the United Kingdom, it transitioned to a BVI-registered entity, and its online portal somaog.com . The company acquired two major Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) covering offshore blocks in Somalia, including PSAs 129/130 and 192.


## History

**A Timeline of Progression**

1980-1991: Leading oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Conoco, Shell, and Eni secured exploration rights in Somalia.

1991-2008:

* 1991: Outbreak of the Civil War in Somalia leading to significant upheaval until 2008.
* 1991-2008: Loss of all historical regional oil and gas geological & geophysical data due to the civil war.

2008-2014:

* 2008: Establishment of a transitional government, which remained until 2012.
* 2012: In September, the Federal Parliament of Somalia elected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President, initiating the reopening of the oil and gas sector.
* 2014: Comprehensive exploration with the 20,552 km 2D seismic survey, leading to the discovery of unexplored deep-water resources. TGS (Spectrum) completed an infil with additional line km shot. The \*\*seismic surveys\*\* conducted in Somalia have played a pivotal role in advancing offshore oil and gas exploration. TGS, in collaboration with the Somali government and industry partners, has led comprehensive 2D multi-client seismic surveys, covering thousands of kilometers in Somali offshore waters. These surveys have provided critical geological data, essential for identifying potential oil and gas reserves. The Somalia 2D Seismic Program, part of TGS’s broader East Africa Seismic Project, offers valuable insights into previously unexplored deep-water regions. This data forms the foundation for understanding Somalia’s hydrocarbon potential, which remains one of the most promising but underexplored areas globally.

* 2014: Efforts by the US, UK, and EU to reduce piracy resulted in no piracy attacks on merchant vessels off Somalia since 2017.

2017-2020:

* 2017: Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed (Farmaajo) elected President.
* 2018: Soma Exploration established, acquiring rights to a 20,552 km 2D seismic data set from 2014.
* 2020: On February 8, the Somali Petroleum Law and Revenue Sharing Agreement were approved and ratified by the President.
* 2020: The Somali Petroleum Authority was established in July, with appointments from both the Federal Government and each member state. This period also saw negotiations with Soma over PSA terms.

2020-2022:

* 2022: From February to October, Soma signed several PSAs and made significant progress with the government's full support.
* 2022: In May, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was re-elected as President, emphasizing the oil and gas sector as crucial for Somalia's growth and encouraging foreign investment.

2023-2024:

* 2023: Soma Oil & Gas BVI, a founding shareholder of Coastline Exploration, acquired PSA 129 & 130 and PSA 192 along with all underlying data, consolidating its stake in the exploration projects.
* 2024: The Federal Republic of Somalia ratified the deal, officially recognizing Soma Oil & Gas Ltd (BVI) as the new sole 100% operator. Subsequently, the subsidiaries were transferred and formally acknowledged by the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS).

Founded as **Soma Oil & Gas UK** in 2013, the company was among the first international firms to sign oil exploration contracts with the Federal Government of Somalia. In 2020, the entity transitioned to become Soma Oil & Gas Ltd (BVI), and ownership shifted, with Basil M. Shiblaq taking control through a holding company. The new entity now focuses on PSAs offshore Somalia, leveraging extensive seismic data and technical expertise to explore the region’s hydrocarbon potential.

This historical timeline reflects Soma Oil & Gas Ltd's evolution and its instrumental role in developing Somalia's offshore hydrocarbon resources. The company continues to play a pivotal part in Somalia's oil and gas sector through ongoing PSAs and exploratory activities.


## Exploration

Soma Oil & Gas Ltd (BVI) holds PSAs 129/130 in the Mid Somalia High basin and PSA 192 in the Mogadishu Deep Basin. These regions are considered highly prospective, with multi-billion barrel recoverable oil estimates. Since 2014, the company has conducted 2D seismic surveys, and in 2022-2023, further technical analysis was completed by consultants such as U3Explore.


## Corporate Structure

The company operates as a British Virgin Islands-registered entity, with subsidiaries holding the respective PSAs for exploration blocks. Ownership is diversified, with 45% held by a legacy investment, 45% by a professional investment firm, and 10% by another private family office.


## Present Day Above Ground Challenges

The security landscape (Above Ground) in Somalia has seen notable developments recently, with several key international actors playing significant roles. Turkey's increased presence is a pivotal change, particularly with the deployment of the seismic vessel Oruc Reis, escorted by two Turkish frigates. This move is part of Turkey's broader energy and defense cooperation with Somalia, which includes providing naval support to safeguard offshore oil exploration operations from piracy and potential land-based threats. The Turkish involvement is a crucial step in improving maritime security, which has been a challenge in the region for over a decade.

Somalia's internal security situation is also undergoing a transformation. With the UN's transition to a country office, more authority has been handed to the Somali government, allowing it to take a lead role in managing security operations. The U.S. training of Danab forces, an elite unit tasked with counterterrorism, continues to play a vital role in strengthening the Somali National Army, particularly in anticipation of the ATMIS (African Union Transition Mission in Somalia) withdrawal, which is set to be completed by December 2024.

The security challenges remain multifaceted. Regional tensions, particularly involving Ethiopia and Egypt, could potentially lead to conflict. Ethiopia's ambitions for Red Sea access through Somaliland, and Egypt's increasing involvement in Somali defense, have complicated the situation further. These developments could create friction, especially as multiple nations vie for influence in the region's geopolitically strategic waters.

The European Union Training Mission (EUTM) and EUCAP Somalia also continue to contribute by training Somali forces and improving maritime capabilities, ensuring that the country can manage its own security in the long term.

While the overall trajectory shows signs of progress, as noted by Stratfor analysts, Somalia's journey towards stability will continue to be shaped by the complex interactions of international support, regional tensions, and internal capacity-building efforts.
