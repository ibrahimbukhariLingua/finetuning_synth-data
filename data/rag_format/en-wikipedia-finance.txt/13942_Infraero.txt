Infraero


# Infraero



**Empresa Brasileira de Infraestrutura Aeroportuária** (abr. **Infraero**) is a Brazilian government corporation founded in 1973, authorized by Law 5,862, that is responsible for operating the main Brazilian commercial airports. In 2011 Infraero's airports carried 179,482,228 passengers, 1,464,484 tons of cargo, and operated 2,893,631 take-offs and landings. Presently it manages 45 airports.

The company is present all over Brazil and employs approximately 23,000 employees and subcontracted workers nationwide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It is headquartered in the Infraero Building, in Brasília, Federal District.


## History

The company implements a workplan which covers practically all airports managed by it and which generates over 50 thousand jobs all over Brazil. The Brazilian airport infrastructure, which may match to the international standards, is being updated to meet the next years demand.

The works are performed with the company's own revenue, mainly generated by the air cargo storage and custom duty, granting of commercial areas in the airports, boarding, landing and stay tariffs, and rendering of communication and air navigation auxiliary services.

On 9 October 2009, it was announced that Infraero will invest in airports abroad: Infraero was invited by the Government of Paraguay to administer Silvio Pettirossi International Airport in Asunción and invited to participate in the privatization of Ruzyně Airport in Prague, Czech Republic, among other investments.

On March 4, 2010, the government of Brazil announced that it would adopt the model of concession to airports. For this reason Infraero would become a concessionary rather than an administrator of the airports that it currently operates. The main consequence is the fact that Infraero will be able to open its capital and obtain resources necessary for infra-structure investments. Another consequence is that municipal or state governments would have it easier to change concessionaries, such as the intention announced on 28 August 2009 by Rosinha Matheus, the Mayor of Campos dos Goytacazes, who requested Infraero the transfer of the administration of Bartolomeu Lysandro Airport to the Municipality. The Minister of Defense, to whom Infraero was subordinate (currently it belongs to Civil Aviation Secretary), announced being in favor of the transfer.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, and in preparation to the several rounds of concession biddings, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels.


## Investments related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup

On 31 August 2009 Infraero unveiled an ambitious BRL5.3 billion (US$2.8 billion; EUR2.0 billion) investment plan to upgrade airports of ten cities focusing mainly the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup which was held in Brazil, and for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was held in Rio de Janeiro. Of the twelve cities that held venues, ten received major investments. Natal – Augusto Severo International Airport and Salvador – Dep. Luís Eduardo Magalhães International Airport were excluded because their upgrade works were completed.

The investments were distributed as follows (in BRL million):

## Concessions

On April 26, 2011, it was confirmed that in order to speed-up much needed renovation and up-grade works, private companies would be granted a concession to commercially exploit some Infraero airports in exchange for the implementation of those works. Listed airports included São Paulo/Guarulhos – Governador André Franco Montoro International Airport, Brasília – Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, Campinas – Viracopos International Airport, and later Belo Horizonte – Tancredo Neves International Airport and Rio de Janeiro – Galeão/Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport. The plan was confirmed on May 31, 2011, and it was added that Infraero would retain 49% of the shares of each privatized airport. However, starting in the fourth phase (2017), this obligation ceased to exist.

The concession program was divided into phases, each with its own public bidding.


### First Phase

The first phase was related to Natal–Gov. Aluízio Alves International Airport. In 1998 Infraero started the planning and construction of the airport. In 2011 the concession of the unfinished facility was auctioned and the winner would have to finish its construction, including the terminal building and control tower. On August 22, 2011, the concession of the airport was won by the Consortium Inframérica, formed by the Brazilian Engineering Group Engevix (50%) and the Argentinean Group Corporación América (50%), which operates 52 airports in seven countries. The concession was for 25 years (with one possible five-year extension) and as part of the agreement Infraero held no shares participation.


### Second Phase

The second phase was related to the auction that took place on February 6, 2012. The result was:

* Consortium Invepar–ACSA, also known as GRU Airport, composed by the Brazilian Investments and Funds Society Invepar (90%) and the South African airport operator ACSA (10%) won the concession of São Paulo/Guarulhos–Gov. André Franco Montoro International Airport and was authorized to explore the facility for 20 years.

### Third Phase

The third phase took place on November 22, 2013, when the Brazilian Government had a bidding process for:

* the operation of Rio de Janeiro/Galeão–Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport from 2014 until 2039. It was won by the Group Aeroporto Rio de Janeiro, also known as RIOgaleão, formed by the Brazilian Conglomerate Odebrecht (60%) and the Singaporean operator Changi Airport Group (40%).

### Fourth Phase

The fourth phase took place on March 16, 2017, and the result was:
