The **Tanzanian Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (TAVCA)** is a non–profit lobbying body facilitating the creation of an environment fostering sustainable private equity ("PE") and venture capital ("VC") investment in Tanzania.

TAVCA facilitates dialogue on a sustainable code of conduct for the African PE context, customised to a Tanzanian setting. TAVCA identifies innovative structured financial instruments and designs policy to stimulate investment for the empowerment of Tanzanians.

Learning from the mistakes of purely private investments and the dynamics of patronage networks, TAVCA is playing a part in establishing an ethically performing sustainable industry in Tanzania.
