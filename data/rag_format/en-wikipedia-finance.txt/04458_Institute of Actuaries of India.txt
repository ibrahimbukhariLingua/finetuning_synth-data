## Placement

Till 2002, multinational reinsurers setting up service offices in India imported actuaries due to severe shortage of skills domestically. By 2005, an Indian actuary with at least 7 years of post-qualification experience was paid about US$40,000 in annual salary. The package rises to US$60,000 for an appointed actuary.

IAI is a statutory body established under The Actuaries Act 2006 (35 of 2006) for regulation of profession of Actuaries in India. The provisions of the said Act have come into force from 10thday of November 2006, in terms of the notification dated 8 November 2006, issued by the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs.
