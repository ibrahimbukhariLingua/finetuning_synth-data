Wall Street station (Connecticut)


# Wall Street station (Connecticut)



**Norwalk station** (also called **Wall Street**) was a station on the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad (later the Danbury Branch of the Housatonic Railroad and the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad) located in Norwalk, Connecticut. It opened in 1852 and closed around 1956. A new station at the site has been considered.


## History

The station opened in 1852 as an original station on the Danbury and Norwalk Railroad. The original depot was replaced in 1859. The depot still stands today as a tattoo business. Located over the tracks, the station building had stairs that led down to the single side platform west of the single track. The station would continue to serve passengers until the Flood of 1955, which caused major damage to the Wall Street area and consequently severely limited service. The following year, the NYNH&H discontinued service to the station.

With recentʷʰᵉⁿ? increases in housing and business growth in the Wall Street area, ConnDOT has begun considering a new station at Wall Street. In July 2018, the study was approved by the State Bond Commission.
