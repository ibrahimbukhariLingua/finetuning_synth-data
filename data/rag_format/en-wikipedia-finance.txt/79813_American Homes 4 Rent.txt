## History

The company was established in October 2012 by B. Wayne Hughes, the founder of Public Storage. It was one of the first large public companies to begin investing heavily in single-family homes, following the entry of The Blackstone Group into the field in 2012. Early funding for the company included a $600 million investment from the Alaska Permanent Fund.

In August 2013, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.

In March 2016, the company merged with American Residential Properties, Inc.

In January 2023, the company announced a branding change from American Homes 4 Rent to AMH in a public news release and a notice to investors.
