## History


### Prior to merger


#### Herbert Smith

Herbert Smith (known as Norman Herbert Smith until 1903) was established by Norman Herbert Smith in 1882. Norman Herbert Smith was descended from Sir William ap Thomas on his father's side and William the Conqueror through his mother's family. Norman Herbert Smith first opened an office at Nicholas House, 12/13 Nicholas Lane, a short distance from the Bank of England.

Norman Herbert Smith was highly influential in launching the career of Lord Atkin, remembered for giving the leading judgement in the case of *Donoghue v Stevenson,* who himself noted that "Smith continued to be my client throughout the whole of my time as a barrister and in the first years almost my only one."

Herbert Smith's specialisation in the early 20th century was in company flotations and advice to mining companies. Later its work expanded to litigation, mergers, and equity matters. Herbert Smith was instructed on the flotation of British Power & Light Corporation Limited and advised on the merger of Columbia Graphophone Company with the Gramophone Company (owner of the His Master's Voice label) to form EMI.

The famed Herbert Smith partner, F.A. Mann, played a pivotal role in transforming the legal profession in England, where litigation was traditionally managed by clerks and barristers. He was instrumental in establishing London solicitors as leading experts in international litigation.

Its strong relationship with US law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore led to Time Warner instructing Herbert Smith for its £220bn acquisition of America Online (AOL) – the largest merger of all time. In 2011, revenues were £465 million and profits-per-equity-partner (PEP) were £900,000.

Herbert Smith had a European partnership with the German firm Gleiss Lutz and the Benelux firm Stibbe until 2011. A plan to merge with those firms did not go ahead.

At the time of its merger with Freehills, Herbert Smith had around 240 partners, 1,300 lawyers, with offices in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.


#### 2012 Freehills merger

Freehills was an Australia-based commercial law firm that operated in the Asia Pacific region. In Australia, it was one of the Australian Big Six law firms.

The firm traced its history back to the practices of Clarke & Moule in Melbourne (1853), Stephen Henry Parker in Perth (1868), Bernard Austin Freehill in Sydney (1871), and John Nicholson in Perth (1896). Predecessors of the firm are notable for having adopted open employment policies, hiring Catholics and Jews when many other firms would not. They are also notable for becoming the first major Australian law firm to appoint a female partner, and forming the first national law partnership in Australia.

At the time of its merger with Herbert Smith, Freehills had 190 partners and 800 lawyers. It had four offices in Australia's capital cities, and an office in Singapore. It had associations with various firms across Asia, many of which continue to this day.


#### Post-merger

Herbert Smith Freehills resulted from the merger, in October 2012, of the two firms. The merger involved an immediate financial integration of the firms in a single partnership and profit pool, an unusual structure for these kinds of mergers. The merger was complicated by differing remuneration structures across the firms; with Herbert Smith practicing a lockstep compensation system, while Freehills practised a merit-based compensation system. Freehills also had a greater number of equity partners.

After merging, the firm began practice in Germany. In September 2012 it opened an office in New York City, focused on international dispute resolution work. A South Korean office was opened in Seoul in April 2013. The combined firm also nearly doubled its total number of international secondees in its first year of operations. In November 2015, Herbert Smith Freehills announced the opening of its third office in Germany, Düsseldorf, headed by Clifford Chance's former head of litigation and arbitration practice.

In February 2022, the Greenwoods & Herbert Smith Freehills taxation practice was sold to PwC.


### 2025 Merger with Kramer Levin

In November 2024, Herbert Smith Freehills announced that it would merge with U.S.-based Kramer Levin to form one of the top-20 global law firms by headcount. The new firm will be known as Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer, abbreviated as HSF Kramer in the U.S., with 25 offices across the UK, Europe, the United States, and Asia. The merger is scheduled to complete 1 May 2025.


## Offices

As of September 2020, HSF has 26 offices in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and the Middle East. The Seoul and Tokyo offices are staffed by Commonwealth lawyers and do not practice local law. The Tokyo office relies upon a referral arrangement with Japan's Big four law firms to avoid competing with them for local legal work, and due to difficulties with hiring Japanese attorneys.


## Controversies


### Anti-Semitic Tweet

Following the firebombing of the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne, Damien Hazard, an Australia corporate lawyer who has been a partner with HSF for 12 years tweeted "Never too soon for Jeremy Leibler to just invent a link with anti-genocide protests". The tweet was deleted and HSF chair and senior partner Rebecca Maslen-Stannage apologized for it. Maslen-Strange said "We were shocked to learn on Friday evening of this deeply offensive post, and very sorry that it was written. These comments could not be more at odds with our firm’s respectful and inclusive culture.” She confirmed that the post was “removed the same evening”, and said “We are treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves.”


## Notable clients and Cases

HSF has assisted numerous notable clients over its years as a firm, some famous, some infamous. Some examples include:


### Sergey Podoprigorov

Herbert Smith Freehills helped Sergey Podoprigorov, a judge in the Russian Federation who sentenced Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent journalist, author, filmmaker, human rights activist and political prisoner that received an extremely harsh prison sentence in Russia in 2023 after publicly criticizing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. HSF prepared an appeal asking the United States Department of the Treasury to remove Podoprigorov from the "Magnitsky list" of corrupt Russian officials responsible for persecution of people fighting against corruption and repression in the country.
