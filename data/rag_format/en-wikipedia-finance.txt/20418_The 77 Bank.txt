## History

The 77 Bank traces its origins to an 1872 law allowing for the establishment of national banks in Japan. Having received approval from the Ministry of Finance in February, 1878, *The 77th National Bank* was established in September in Miyagi prefecture, an area with very limited banking services at the time. The famous industrialist of the time and president of the First National Bank, Shibusawa Eiichi, took an interest in the development of the Tohoku region; he supported the fledgling bank through advice, provision of some of his own funds, and the supply of personnel from The First National Bank when The 77th National Bank was founded.

The 77th National Bank changed its name to *The 77 Bank, Ltd.* in 1932, when it merged with the Tohoku Jitsugyo Bank and the Gojo Bank.

Although The 77 Bank closed representative offices and branches in London and New York City after the collapse of the bubble economy in the 1990s, it opened a representative office in Shanghai in July, 2005.
