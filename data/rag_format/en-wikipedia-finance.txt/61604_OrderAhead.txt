## History

OrderAhead was founded by Jeffrey Byun and Henry Lee in 2012 after they completed Y Combinator. The founders started OrderAhead so that customers could easily order food for pickup without having to wait to order, wait to pay or wait to have their food prepared. The company's service was made available via smartphone apps and was free for users.

OrderAhead started in Palo Alto, California, but quickly expanded to the greater Bay Area after raising a seed round in the summer of 2012. After raising Series A funding one year later in 2013, OrderAhead expanded nationally to major metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Chicago and New York City.

Square Inc. acquired OrderAhead in late 2016 to complement its existing Caviar online food ordering service.
