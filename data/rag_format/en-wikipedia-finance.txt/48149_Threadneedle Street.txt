Threadneedle Street


# Threadneedle Street



**Threadneedle Street** is a street in the City of London, England, between Bishopsgate at its northeast end and Bank junction in the southwest. It is one of nine streets that converge at Bank. It lies in the ward of Cornhill.


## History

Threadneedle street is famous as the site of the Bank of England. The bank itself is sometimes known as 'the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street' and has been based at its current location since 1734. The London Stock Exchange was situated on Threadneedle Street until 2004, when it relocated to nearby Paternoster Square. The Baltic Exchange was founded in the *Virginia and Baltick Coffee House* on Threadneedle Street in 1744. It is now located on St Mary Axe.


## Etymology

Some believe that the name originated as Three Needle Street, first attested to in 1598, perhaps from a signboard portraying three needles, or from the three needles on the arms of needle-makers who had premises on the street. The threads and needles used by the members of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors is another possibility, since the livery company's hall has been located on Threadneedle Street since 1347. Before 1598, the road was part of Broad Street, now Old Broad Street.
