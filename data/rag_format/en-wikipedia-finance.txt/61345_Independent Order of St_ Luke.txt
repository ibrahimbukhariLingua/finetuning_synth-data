Independent Order of St. Luke


# Independent Order of St. Luke



The **Independent Order of St. Luke** was an African American fraternal order founded to promote Black economic independence. It was founded after the Civil War (1861â€“1865) in Baltimore, Maryland by Mary Ann Prout. It was first called the **United Order of St. Luke**.


## History

Black fraternal orders provided a means for Black community members to create resources to promote independence, self-reliance, and success that was not available to them by white businesses due to segregation. Members of the African American community also supported and were employed and serviced by Black businesses, like retail stores, insurance companies, banks, newspapers, and homes for the elderly.

In 1869, the organization split into two factions. The new organization Independent Order of St. Luke was operated from Richmond, Virginia by William M. T. Forrester. He ran the organization for thirty years, until the late 1890s, when membership had fallen to 1,000 members.

Maggie L. Walker had led the development of a juvenile department and rose through the ranks of the organization until she became the leader of the organization in 1899. In two years, she doubled its membership. New headquarters were established at the St. Luke Building in 1903. St. Luke Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Under her leadership, the organization supported 100,000 members in 26 states. Her policy of "cooperative economics" resulted in Black businesses employing Black workers, which were patronized by the community. She oversaw the founding of the *St. Luke Herald* newspaper, a department store, and the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank. The Consolidated Bank and Trust was the longest-running, independently owned Black-owned bank in the country. It was sold in 2005.

Hattie N. F. Walker, Maggie Walker's daughter-in-law, became leader of the organization after Maggie died in 1934. She ran the organization until 1957. The fraternal order was disbanded in 1988.

With other Black fraternal orders, the Independent Order of St. Luke helped Richmond being named as the "Birthplace of Black Capitalism," "Black Wall Street," and "Harlem of the South."

Papers of the Independent Order of St. Luke are held at the Library of Virginia.
