IT risk management


# IT risk management



**IT risk management** is the application of risk management methods to information technology in order to manage IT risk. Various methodologies exist to manage IT risks, each involving specific processes and steps.

An IT risk management system (ITRMS) is a component of a broader enterprise risk management (ERM) system. ITRMS are also integrated into broader information security management systems (ISMS). The continuous update and maintenance of an ISMS is in turn part of an organisation's systematic approach for identifying, assessing, and managing information security risks.


## Definitions

The Certified Information Systems Auditor Review Manual 2006 by ISACA provides this definition of risk management: "*Risk management is the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization.*"

According to the NIST, "*Risk management allows IT managers to balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures with mission goals by securing IT systems and data.*"

The American National Information Assurance Training and Education Center defines risk management in the IT field as:

1. *The total process to identify, control, and minimize the impact of uncertain events. The objective of the risk management program is to reduce risk and obtain and maintain DAA approval. The process facilitates the management of security risks by each level of management throughout the system life cycle. The approval process consists of three elements: risk analysis, certification, and approval.*
2. *An element of managerial science concerned with the identification, measurement, control, and minimization of uncertain events. An effective risk management program encompasses the following four phases:*
 1. *Risk assessment, as derived from an evaluation of threats and vulnerabilities.*
 2. *Management decision.*
 3. *Control implementation.*
 4. *Effectiveness review.*
3. *The total process of identifying, measuring, and minimizing uncertain events affecting AIS resources. It includes risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, safeguard selection, security test and evaluation, safeguard implementation, and systems review.*
4. *The total process of identifying, controlling, and eliminating or minimizing uncertain events that may affect system resources. lt includes risk analysis, cost benefit analysis, selection, implementation and test, security evaluation of safeguards, and overall security review.*
