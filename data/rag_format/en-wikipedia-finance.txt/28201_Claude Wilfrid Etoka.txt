# Claude Wilfrid Etoka



**Claude Wilfrid Etoka (a.k.a. Willy Etoka)** (born 30 May 1969, in Brazzaville, Congo) is a Congolese businessperson. He is CEO of the oil trading company SARPD Oil and Oil Palm. With a wealth estimated at US$1 million, he is known for acting as a trustee of the family of the Congolese president.


## Career

Etoka founded SARPD Oil in 2003, which became, according to *The Times*, a "rising star in African oil trading", with a trading floor based in Geneva and marketing operations set up in Morocco under Casablanca Finance City regulations.

Etoka is a politically exposed person. His bank accounts at BNP Paribas were closed due to his known close links with the president of Congo and the improbable level of profitability of his companies arising out of corruption and misappropriations of Congolese oils. His company supplies 10% of the Congolese fuel market, In *Jeune Afrique* (11 May 2015). Etoka featured as one of the well-connected ‘Golden Boys’; new African traders breaking through in the oil markets traditionally dominated by the international oil giants which are controlled and owned by Europeans (Glencore, Trafigura, Vitol, Mercuria, Oryx Energy). Within 10 years, his company SARPD Oil ranked as the fifth oil player in Africa in terms of trading.

SARPD Oil runs large trading and financial operations in partnership with global companies such as Glencore. In 2015, the two partners structured a long-term oil-deal with the Republic of the Congo. The deal was criticised as being a disguised debt not inscribed into the national budget of Congo-Brazzaville.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Forbes Africa — using the similarity with the famous *Forbes Magazine* — has been used to promote the Sassou Nguesso family and create a veneer of respectability for the various nominees, laundering funds for the Sassou Nguesso family. For example, Etoka won the prize for the 6th edition of the Bâtisseurs de L’Economie Africaine (Builder of the African Economy) held in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The prize is for personalities that provide a substantial contribution to the economic and social development of Africa. This was a way of legitimating the rapid accumulation of wealth acquired through money laundering.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
