# TVN24 BiS



**TVN24 BiS** (formerly **TVN CNBC** and **TVN24 Biznes i Świat**) is a Polish 24-hour hybrid business and world news channel, sister channel to TVN24. TVN24 BiS belongs to the TVN Group which in turn is controlled by Warner Bros. Discovery. The channel's main newsroom and studio are located at the Media Business Centre building in Warsaw. As the hybrid business and International news channel, most of the programmes are a combination of both format, although there are some exceptions.

The channel is available on satellite television platforms Polsat Box and Canal+, as well as most cable networks in Poland. The channel is competing with Telewizja Polsat's Polsat News 2, which also utilises the hybrid 'news and business' format similar to TVN24 BiS's.


## History

The channel was launched on 3 September 2006 as **TVN CNBC Biznes** in cooperation with CNBC Europe, and was part of NBC Universal's worldwide network of business-oriented channels. It also served as CNBC's "Polish Bureau" providing occasional live feeds for breaking news in Poland and Central Europe. The facilities were also used to produce Poland's first TV series about Polish business – "Business Poland" which aired as part of CNBC's weekend programming in Europe and weekly programming on CNBC World in North America.

TVN24, the channel's sister operation, produced business news segments under the TVN CNBC banner.

On 1 January 2014 at 00:00, the channel was rebranded as **TVN24 Biznes i Świat**, dropping any reference to the CNBC brand. It also adopted the 'news and business' hybrid format.

On 26 February 2016, the channel shortened its name to **TVN24 BiS**. On 8 November 2016, the channel launched an HD simulcast feed.
