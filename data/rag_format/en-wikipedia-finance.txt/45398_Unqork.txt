**Unqork** is a cloud computing and enterprise software company based in New York, NY that offers a no-code development platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for building enterprise applications. Unqork supports organizations in finance, insurance, healthcare, and government.


## History

Unqork was founded in 2017 by CEO Gary Hoberman, who was formerly the CIO of insurance company Metlife.

In February 2020, the company completed a series B funding round of $131M. In March, the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications used the Unqork platform to build a digital portal that would allow free meals to be delivered to New York City residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. In August, Crain's New York Business reported that the company was one of New York City's fastest growing startups. In October, Unqork announced that it had raised an additional $207 million in a Series C funding round led by accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc., bringing the company's valuation to more than $2 billion.

In May 2021, Chicago's Department of Housing, in partnership with the Resurrection Project, used the Unqork platform to distribute rent relief funds to Chicago residents. That same month, a Forrester report on low-code platforms dubbed Unqork "rookie of the year", though the company differentiates no-code from low-code. In a July report, research firm HFS Solutions reported that the company's customers included Goldman Sachs, Liberty Mutual, and the Cities of New York, Chicago and Washington DC.

Unqork ranked number 5 on Fast Company's Most Innovative Enterprise Tech Companies of 2022. That same year, the company also ranked among America's Best Startups by Forbes.
