## Career

After receiving her Ph.D. in market strategy and insight from the University of Texas in 1989, Henderson became an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University. During her time there (from 1988 to 1992) she conducted global research on the impact of design on consumer response and the potential return on investment of design. Her discoveries were published in the Harvard Business Review and other top journals. In 1990, she presented her research and chaired a sub-committee at the Academy of Marketing Science conference.

In 1992, Henderson became a full professor of marketing at Washington State University. While there, she furthered her research on the integration of design in market research and business strategy. Henderson also assisted the United States National Laboratory System to identify products and markets from technology platforms. This work became the base for developing Disruptive Market ResearchÂ®, a user-centered, qualitative approach to market research that identifies areas for innovation.

In 2003, Henderson founded NewEdge, which uses her research in utilizing design methodology for business strategy. Her research was published in journals such as the Wall Street Journal and the Harvard Business Review, and featured spots on NPR. In 2006, Henderson began contributing to the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) as an innovation subject matter expert on combining technology push and market pull.

Henderson later left Washington State University to grow NewEdge full-time, and expanded the company to additional locations in Seattle, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. She has been a guest speaker for a number of business and science organizations such as the Association for Consumer Research, the Industrial Research Institute, 31st Annual Meeting of the Western Decision Sciences Institute, the American Advertising Federation, Reputation Institute, Danaher, Novellis, John Deere, and Procter & Gamble.
