# Wanhua Chemical Group

## History

The listed company was incorporated in 1998 as Yantai Wanhua Polyurethane Co., Ltd. (Chinese: 烟台万华聚氨酯股份有限公司).

The shares started to trade in the Shanghai Stock Exchange in January 2001.

Initially, the listed company only owned the methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) production line of the former Yantai synthetic leather factory. It was a common practice at that time to list part of the assets instead of the whole conglomerate. The size of the listed company expanded beyond that assets, however.

That MDI production line was replaced by a new one in 2014, also located in Yantai. The company also imported technology from Honeywell for its Yantai plant in 2018.

In 2017, the shares of the listed company became a constituent of the blue-chip index SSE 50.

In February 2019, the listed company acquired Hungarian company BorsodChem and other assets, via a reverse merger with the largest shareholder of the listed company in an all-share deal that worth RMB52 billion.

In July 2019, the listed company acquired Swedish company Chematur Technologies for a reported US$134 million from Jilin-based Kangnaier Investment Group (Chinese: 吉林市康乃尔投资集团; also transliterated as Connell Chemical Industry LLC) and another investor. In the same month, the listed company formed a shipping joint venture with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).

In February 2019, Wanhua Chemical Group made a reverse merger with its direct parent company at that time, 烟台万华化工有限公司. That company also owned the shares of BorsodChem.

In January 2018, the parent company was split into two companies: Wanhua Industrial Group and 烟台万华化工有限公司 (pinyin: *Yāntái wànhuá huàgōng*; lit. 'Yantai Wanhua chemical industry', ' limited company'). The latter became the new largest shareholder of the listed company instead. At that time, that company owned 47.92% shares of Wanhua Chemical Group.

However, in February 2019, the listed company merged with its largest shareholder, with the listed company is the surviving entity.
