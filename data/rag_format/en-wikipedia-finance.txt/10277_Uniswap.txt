Uniswap


# Uniswap



**Uniswap** is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that uses a set of smart contracts to create liquidity pools for the execution of trades. It is an open source project and falls into the category of a DeFi product (Decentralized finance) because it uses smart contracts to facilitate trades instead of a centralized exchange. The protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts. As of December 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Uniswap is estimated to be the second largest decentralized exchange and the seventh-largest cryptocurrency exchange overall by daily trading volume.


## History

Uniswap was created on November 2, 2018 by Hayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Adams is the founder and CEO of Uniswap Labs, the company responsible for the development of the Uniswap Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. Adams launched Uniswap in November 2018, after working as a mechanical engineer and being inspired by a blog post written by Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ His goal was to create a decentralized platform for exchanging tokens without relying on centralized exchanges.

Adams had no prior experience in blockchain technology or software development but taught himself through online resources. His innovative work on Uniswap has played a key role in the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) by introducing the **Automated Market** Maker (AMM) model, which allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets.

The Uniswap company received investments from business angel Ric Burton and venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm Operations, Union Square Ventures LLC and ParaFi. Uniswap’s average daily trading volume was US$220 million in October 2020. Traders and investors have utilized Uniswap because of its usage in decentralized finance (DeFi).


### Uniswap Labs

Uniswap Labs is a software company in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, founded in 2018 by Hayden Adams.

In 2022 Uniswap Labs had raised $165 million, after announcing in 2021 that it was looking to raise between $100 and $200 million and was working with Polychain.

Uniswap offers products such as a self-custodial mobile wallet, a Trading API for professional users, and a web interface. These tools provide access to liquidity across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism. The company has also collaborated with traditional finance platforms like Fireblocks to integrate DeFi features into traditional financial systems, thereby expanding its reach to institutional clients.


## Overview

Uniswap is a decentralized finance protocol that is used to exchange cryptocurrencies and tokens; it is provided on blockchain networks that run open-source software. This is in contrast to cryptocurrency exchanges that are run by centralized companies.

Changes to the protocol are voted on by the owners of a native cryptocurrency and governance token called UNI, and then implemented by a team of developers. Uniswap launched without the UNI token, and the token is not needed to trade on the exchange. Tokens were initially distributed to early users of the protocol.


## Protocol

Uniswap acts as an automated market maker and uses liquidity pools to fulfill orders, instead of relying on a traditional market maker, with an aim to create more efficient markets. Individuals and bots—termed "liquidity providers"—provide liquidity to the exchange by adding a pair of tokens to a smart contract which can be bought and sold by other users according to the constant-product rule {\displaystyle \phi (x,y)=xy}. In return, liquidity providers are given a percentage of the trading fees earned for that trading pair. For each trade, a certain amount of tokens is removed from the pool for an amount of the other token, thereby changing the price. No fees are required to list tokens which allow a large amount of Ethereum tokens to be accessible and no registration is required for users. As open-source software, Uniswap's code can also be forked to create new exchanges.


## UNI token

UNI is the governance token of the Uniswap protocol, enabling holders to participate in the platform's decentralized governance. Introduced in September 2020, UNI was distributed through an airdrop to early users of the platform and allocated to various stakeholders, including the development team, investors, and a community treasury.

The token allows holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades, changes to fee structures, and other governance-related matters. UNI operates on the Ethereum blockchain following the ERC-20 standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of decentralized applications. Its total supply is capped, with a scheduled release over several years to support ongoing development and ecosystem growth.
