## History

Risk Strategies was founded by Mike Christian in 1997 to provide risk management advice to upper middle market commercial clients, with a focus on private equity and healthcare. In 2000, it made its first acquisition of Andrew Anthony and Associates. By 2001, the company had 15 employees.

In 2002, Risk Strategies expanded as an insurance brokerage to provide clients with specialized coverages and alternative risk financing programs. By the end of 2006, Risk Strategies was licensed in 48 states.

A minority investment from WR Berkley enabled expansion into the Midwest and California markets as well as new practice areas and market categories.

In 2013, Kohlberg & Company, L.L.C, a private equity firm, acquired a majority interest in Risk Strategies. The new investment helped Risk Strategies expand into new markets and products. As of 2013, Risk Strategies had 10 offices, 120 employees, and $40 million in revenue.

With access to investment capital, Risk Strategies pursued acquisitions and hires across specialty industries. In 2014, Risk Strategies made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring, DeWitt Stern, a specialist in the Entertainment, Media, Private Client, and Fine Art insurance sectors. With this acquisition, Risk Strategies was considered a Top 35 broker nationally, with nearly $100 million in revenue and almost 400 employees nationwide.
