Business activity monitoring


# Business activity monitoring



**Business activity monitoring** (**BAM**) is a category of software intended for use in monitoring and tracking business activities.

BAM is a term introduced by Gartner, Inc., referring to the collection, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities within organizations, including those involving customers and partners. BAM tracks individual business processes and sequences of activities across multiple systems and applications and provides information about them in real time.


## Description

BAM software is used to monitor the status and outcomes of operations, processes, and transactions. BAM systems typically display data on computer dashboards, but they differ from business intelligence (BI) dashboards. In BAM systems, events are processed in real time or near real time and displayed immediately, whereas BI dashboards typically update at scheduled intervals by querying databases.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
