# Tampines



**Tampines** (IPA: /ˈtæmpəniːs/ TAM-pə-nees) is the regional centre of the East Region of Singapore. With a population of 284,560 living across its five subzones as of 2024, it is the most populous planning area in Singapore. It is home to approximately 5% of Singapore's population. Tampines is bordered to the west by Bedok and Paya Lebar, to the north by Pasir Ris, to the east by Changi, and to the south by the Straits of Singapore. Situated in the historical region of Tanah Merah, its present-day terrain is particularly flat due to the large-scale sand quarrying in the 1960s.

Tampines is composed of five subzones — Tampines North, Tampines East, Tampines West, Simei and Xilin. These subzones were created in the early 1990s predominantly for urban planning purposes and have no relation to the three political constituencies in Tampines. Four of its subzones are largely residential with the exception of Xilin, which has a fair mix of commercial, industrial and recreational facilities. Xilin is home to Singapore Expo, the largest convention center in Singapore, and features the largest agglomeration of golf courses in Singapore.

As the first regional centre in Singapore, Tampines has progressed from a remote neighbourhood in the 1980s to a vibrant commercial hub. It is one of three regional centres in the city-state, serving to decentralise economic activity from the Central Business District to other parts of the island, an idea first proposed in the 1991 Concept Plan. Several large insurance companies, real estate corporations and financial institutions, such as OCBC and UOB, have shifted their back-end operations to the regional centre. According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, it now has 200,000 m² of office space and 112,000 m² of retail space. Tampines is also home to Changi Business Park, Singapore’s largest integrated business park. It is a 71,000 m² project that houses many multinational corporations, including J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse, IBM and Standard Chartered. As of 2016, it has 152,400 resident working persons, the second-highest in Singapore, according to the Department of Statistics.

Tampines New Town in the north is a densely-populated residential town, and regarded as the core of the planning area. Its boundaries, as delineated by the Housing Development Board, exclude Xilin and the private housing estates of Simei. It spans 1200 hectares, of which 549 hectares is residential area, the largest of any town in Singapore. It is currently the third-most populous town in Singapore, with 232,700 residents (as of 2018). Amidst rapid ongoing development in Tampines North and with a projected ultimate of 110,000 dwelling units, Tampines is expected to become the most populous town in Singapore in the near future. Regarded as a mature estate by the Government, it is the first estate in Singapore to employ its own municipal services office, given the variety of municipal issues it has to handle. Enforcement of certain minor infractions has also been delegated to Tampines Municipal Services through its enforcement officers.


## Etymology

The name Tampines goes back to the Franklin and Jackson map of 1828. It is named after Sungei Tampines, which in turn got its name from the *tempinis* trees (Malay for *Streblus elongatus*) which were said to be growing by it.


## History

In the past, Tampines was covered by forests, swamps, and sand quarries. Ironwood trees, or *tempinis* in Malay, grew abundantly. The area was part of a military training area until about 1987.

The oldest street in the area, Tampines Road, dates to 1864 when it was a cart track. At the turn of the 20th century, Tampines was a rubber plantation. Tampines was also home to the sand quarry for a long time. Among the plantations were Teo Tek Ho and Hun Yeang estates.


### Development boom in the 1980s

The new town started in 1978. Construction began for Neighbourhoods 1 and 2 and was completed between 1983 and 1987, although they were given priority. Neighbourhoods 8 and 9 began in 1985–1989, followed by Neighbourhood 5, which was completed in 1989 with the Tampines Town Centre. Neighbourhood 4 was completed with the new Tampines North Division between 1986 and 1988. Tampines Town was at the fast-paced expansion that breaks it into Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North, and Tampines Changkat divisions.

For the Singapore MRT plans, they showed "Tampines North" and "Tampines South" since the planning stages, which is due to the similar townships from 1979 to 1982, before they were renamed respectively in 1985 to Tampines and Simei.

New construction methods expedited the development of the town's infrastructure. More attractive designs, colours, and finishings were incorporated into Tampines than earlier public housing, which consisted of uniform slabs of concrete laid out row after row with more thought given to function than form. The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) managed the construction of the town until 1991, when it handed the reins over to the Tampines Town Council. The Town Council is run by grassroot leaders and the residents themselves.

The Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the World Habitat Award to Tampines, which was selected as a representative of Singapore's new towns, on 5 October 1992. The award was given to recognise an outstanding contribution towards human settlement and development.

Neighbourhoods 3 and 7 were only fully completed in 1997, and the constituencies had been reformed to include the new Tampines Central division.


### Residential expansion in the 2010s

Construction was paused until the developments of Tampines Central were started in 2010, which consists of The Premiere @ Tampines, Tampines GreenLeaf, Centrale 8, Tampines Trilliant, and Citylife @ Tampines, including some of the other leftover pockets of residential developments such as Tampines GreenTerrace, Arc @ Tampines, Q Bay Residences and The Santorini.

Neighbourhood 6, which is also known as Tampines North New Town, has started construction with the first Build-To-Order (BTO) flats Tampines GreenRidges being announced at the end of November 2014. Tampines GreenRidges is also part of the first phase of the Tampines North New Town's Park West District, which is the first district to be constructed in the Tampines North New Town development.

Tampines Court, had been en-bloc since July 2017 and all residents vacated their premises by 12 December 2018. It is a former HUDC flat that was privatised in 2002. The upcoming condominium is Treasure at Tampines.

## Economy


### Cost of living


#### Housing

In the first quarter of 2024, Tampines had the highest median rent for executive apartments in Singapore, at S$4,000. It had the seventh highest rent for 5-room HDB flats, at S$3,600.


#### Food

Tampines is the 12th most expensive planning area for food, according to the 2016 Makan Index by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP). Over the years, the cost of living in Tampines has risen significantly.

In 2023, the Makan Index revealed that Tampines had the highest price among 26 residential neighbourhoods for a lunch or dinner at a kopitiam, food court or hawker centre. It cost S$14.90 for a plate of chicken briyani with iced Milo. It also had the highest average price for a breakfast set in the East Region at S$3.39.

These high food prices can be attributed to the high rents in Tampines. In 2024, a kopitiam in Tampines broke the record for the highest tendered rent, since the HDB's Price-Quality Method (PQM) for tenders began in 2016. There were 20 participating tenders in that particular exercise, with the successful tenderer setting the rent at $88,889.00. Four of the six most expensive coffeeshops under this tender method are in Tampines. In 2022, Tampines also set the record for the most expensive coffee shop by resale price in Singapore, at $41.68 million.

The manufacturing industries are located in Tampines South and Changi South. Tampines Central is a hub for various financial institutions, ranging from banks to insurance companies, like OCBC, UOB, Income and AIA.


## Politics


### Electoral boundaries

Originally, Tampines was under the Tampines Single Member Constituency, when it was still under development. Its population grew quickly and, in 1988, its electoral boundaries were redrawn to form the Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Eunos GRC.

Eunos GRC was eventually dissolved in 1997. The ward of Tampines North was split and absorbed into Pasir Ris GRC and Tampines GRC. The rest of the former was absorbed back into Tampines GRC. Pasir Ris GRC then dissolved in 2001, after just one election.

Since 2001, Tampines has been divided into three GRCs, namely the namesake Tampines (for Tampines North, Tampines East and Tampines West), Aljunied (for the area around Temasek Polytechnic) and East Coast (for Xilin and Simei). Minor changes have been made to its electoral boundaries in some elections.

In 2025, Tampines will be divided into one GRC - Tampines GRC (Tampines East, Tampines Changkat, Tampines Central, Tampines West, Tampines Green) and one SMC (Tampines North), as the remaining areas of Aljunied and East Coast GRCs will then be transferred to Tampines GRC (with the exception of Changi-Simei). Tampines GRC will also include Paya Lebar Airbase as well.


### Contesting parties

The Workers' Party (WP) had contested parts of the town in Tampines North, under the now-defunct Eunos GRC, in 1988 and 1991. In both general elections, WP lost with 49.11% and 47.62% of the votes respectively.

The National Solidarity Party had contested in the town in all the general elections, except in 1997, when the party was disqualified. It contested under the Singapore Democratic Alliance in the 2001 and 2006 elections.

Most of Tampines has been led by the People's Action Party (PAP) since the independence of Singapore. The only exception (as of 2020) is the southwestern parts of Tampines West, which is under the Aljunied GRC and has been led by WP since 2010.


### Members of Parliament

MPs in Tampines also serve as the grassroots leaders in their respective GRCs, as is the case in the rest of Singapore.

Former minister Mah Bow Tan had contested in and led the constituency from 1988 until his retirement from politics in 2015. Between 2011 and 2020, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat headed the PAP team, before he was transferred to East Coast GRC. As of 2020, Tampines GRC has been led by Minister of the Environment and Water Resources and Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli, who has been contesting since the 2006 general election.

### Tampines Regional Centre

The urban planning policy of Singapore is to create partially self-sufficient towns, in terms of commercial needs, to relieve strain on traffic drawn to the city centre. Thus, an array of facilities are provided primarily for residents in the new towns. Tampines is one of Singapore's four regional centres (along with Woodlands, Jurong East and future Seletar), under the plan of the Urban Redevelopment Authority. As a result, the Tampines Regional Centre serves the Tampines residents and the entire East Region.


### Commercial services

There are three hotels in Tampines — Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore, Park Avenue Changi and capri by Fraser. Catered to business travellers, they are all located in and around Changi Business Park.

Retail shopping in the Tampines Regional Centre is done at four main shopping malls — Tampines Mall, Century Square, Tampines 1 and Our Tampines Hub. Commercial tenants of the shopping centres include restaurants, supermarkets, department stores, cinemas, bookstores, international money remittance and gift shops.

There are other malls outside the New Town as well, namely Eastpoint Mall, Singapore Expo, and Changi City Point.

On 30 November 2006, IKEA opened its second outlet and first megastore in Singapore at Tampines Retail Park, adjacent to Courts and Giant, together, these three are the first to have retail warehouse stores in Singapore. On 9 April 2009, UNIQLO opened its first outlet in Southeast Asia at Tampines 1.


### Community services

Tampines Regional Library, the first regional public library in Singapore, was initially located along Tampines Avenue 7 and officially opened on 3 December 1994. It served as a "prototype library" to test new services and features before their implementation at other branch libraries. It was converted into a cybersecurity facility called *Tachyon @ 31* in September 2023.

The library was relocated to Our Tampines Hub in 2017, an integrated community and lifestyle hub. This new location continues to serve the eastern part of Singapore, offering expanded facilities and services. The library's initial concept was to be a "library of the future," aligning with the Library 2000 Review Committee's vision.

Tampines has six community clubs, which are managed by the People's Association and provide a wide range of services. Among them, Tampines Central Community Club is housed within Our Tampines Hub. These community clubs are common spaces for residents to come together, and they occasionally provide information from the government on national policies through events and booths.


### Healthcare

Changi General Hospital (CGH) is a major restructured hospital operated by SingHealth in Simei, one of the subzones in the Tampines. It is the fourth largest healthcare facility in Singapore, with a capacity of 1,000 beds. As Singapore's first purpose-built general hospital, it caters to communities in the East Region of Singapore. The hospital houses six specialist centres and encompass a wide range of disciplines, such as cardiology, orthopaedic surgery, and sports medicine. In Newsweek's World's Best Specialized Hospitals 2024 ranking, CGH ranks 48th in pulmonology, 69th in neurosurgery, 113rd in orthopedics, and 164th in oncology.

Other healthcare facilities include two polyclinics, with one in Tampines East and the other in Tampines North. These polyclinics offer a wide array of health services for residents, from management of chronic diseases to treatment of acute medical conditions. Besides the polyclinics, Tampines has several nursing homes and elderly day care centres to support its ageing population.


### Neighbourhood centres

As of 2024, there are six neighbourhood centres in Tampines, as gazetted in the URA Master Plan. They are located in neighbourhoods 1 to 5 and 8.

Tampines Street 11 Neighbourhood Centre is the first in the planning area. Developments in the neighbourhood centre include the Tampines Town Council and Tampines Round Market & Food Centre, which opened in 1983 as the first hawker centre in Tampines.

Tampines N2 Shopping Street has Singapore's most expensive coffee shop, which was sold for a record $41.68 million. The 604-square-metre establishment, known as 21 Street Eating House, features 18 stalls. This purchase price translates to approximately $6,411 per square foot, nearly matching the average rate for ground-level retail units in Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza along Orchard Road.

Tampines Central Shopping Street and ShopTWest see a comparatively high footfall, due to their proximity to Tampines MRT Station and Temasek Polytechnic respectively.

Two additional neighbourhood centres are planned. One of them will be located on a mixed-use site in Tampines North, sharing the land plot with the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub. In 2022, a consortium comprising UOL Group, Singapore Land, and CapitaLand Development submitted the highest bid of S$1.206 billion to develop the site. The other future neighbourhood centre will be constructed in the Tampines South estate, as part of a proposed mixed-use development. On 27 June 2024, the HDB launched the sale of the site via public tender. This site has the potential to accommodate 585 residential units and will feature a gross floor area of 61,837 square metres. The development will include an early childhood development centre (ECDC), a supermarket, a food court, and a community plaza, with an underpass connection to Tampines West MRT station.


### Our Tampines Hub

Our Tampines Hub is a new development in Tampines. Construction began in June 2013 and it opened on 9 November 2016. It is located at the site of the former Tampines Stadium along Avenue 4 and 5, together with the swimming pool.

It is built for the residents of Tampines and provides a community space where residents can gather, interact, and bond with others from the community. Facilities available include a community centre, sports and recreation centres, swimming pools, bowling alleys, karaoke facilities, information centres, and several offices. The Tampines Regional Library was also relocated here.


## Parks and recreation


### Large parks

There are three main parks in Tampines New Town. Sun Plaza Park, located at Tampines Avenue 7 and 9, is one of the first parks in Tampines and previously featured a crocodile-shaped playground in the 1990s. Tampines Eco Green, one of NPark's few nature parks, is 36.5 hectares and located northeast of Sun Plaza Park. Home to over 75 species of birds, Tampines Eco Green remains largely preserved in its existing ecological state, with marshlands, secondary forests and freshwater ponds. Tampines Boulevard Park stretches from Tampines Avenue 9 to the future Tampines North MRT station, and forms the spine of Tampines North. These three parks are adjacent to each other and interconnected by footpaths and cycling paths.

The former Tampines Bike Park, was located west of Tampines Avenue 12, at the current site of Tampines Boulevard Park. Managed by Sport Singapore, it had the only BMX track in Singapore and a 13km-long mountain bike trail. An estimated 2,600 riders visited the park each month. In 2010, Tampines Bike Park hosted BMW events during the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics. It officially closed on 17 September 2014, to make way for housing and future developments in Tampines North.

There are other parks in Tampines outside the New Town. Changi Business Park Garden is one of them, serving employees in the area. It runs through the centre of the business park, with The Signature building to its south. There are two large ponds and an amphitheatre in the garden.

Zone H of East Coast Park features the only beach in Tampines. Located just south of the National Service Resort & Country Club (NSRCC), the beach in this zone can extend up to 100 metres out to sea during extreme low tides. East Coast Park offers residents an uninterrupted cycling path to the Central Business District (CBD). It also connects to Changi Airport to its northeast.


### Community parks and nature ways

The other parks in Tampines New Town are mainly community parks — Tampines North Park, Tampines Leisure Park, Tampines Central Park, Tampines Park, Festival Park, Tampines Green, Tampines Tree Garden, and some neighbourhood parks. These small parks serve as outdoor spaces for residents to engage in exercise activities near their homes. Occasionally, community-related events are held at Festival Park. They also serve as nodes of the Tampines Nature Way.

Tampines Nature Way, characterised by its lush vegetation of trees and shrubs, is designed to mimic natural forest ecosystems. One of many nature ways in Singapore, it serves as a vital corridor for wildlife, like including birds and butterflies, to move between green spaces. Tampines Nature Way connects Tampines Eco Green, Bedok Reservoir and Pasir Ris Park, which have rich biodiversity, to the urban areas in Tampines. This also fosters a deeper appreciation of Singapore's City in Nature initiative.

Simei Nature Way serves a similar purpose, connecting green spaces in adjacent neighbourhoods. It also connects the extensive Tampines Nature Way to the Upper Changi Nature Way.

In the future, more green spaces will be added in Tampines. According to the URA Masterplan 2019, a plot of land beside the future Tampines GreenQuartz neighbourhood in Tampines West has been earmarked for a future community park.


### Park connector

Tampines Park Connector is one of many under the Park Connector Network (PCN) in Singapore that aims to promote cycling and connect parks together with shared-use paths. With a combined length of 7 kilometres, the Tampines Park Connector provides residents with an alternative means of traversing the town and visiting other parks in Singapore.

The northeastern section of Tampines Park Connector runs along Sungei Tampines. Between 2018 and 2022, the concrete canal was rebuilt into a naturalised waterway under a contract by PUB, marking the third project of its kind in Singapore. The project, which cost S$48.827 million, features lookout decks on both sides, allowing visitors to experience the waterway up close.


### Undesignated park

On the outskirts of Tampines lies an undesignated park, Tampines Quarry Park. It used to be a sand quarry in the early to mid-1900s, to support the development boom in the 20th century. Rainwater has since filled the quarry. It is not equipped with any facilities, but this park still remains popular among nearby residents and off-road cycling enthusiasts. As it is hidden behind lush greenery, there are no signs or entrances to the park, though there are hidden pathways to enter.


## Transport


### Road network

A network of expressways, namely the Pan-Island Expressway, East Coast Parkway and Tampines Expressway, and arterial roads allow easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the island. Tampines Avenue 10, an arterial street, forms the start/end of the Outer Ring Road System, a semi-expressway.


### Mass rapid transit

There are currently 6 MRT stations that serve the planning area across 2 lines, the East West line and Downtown line. Both lines have two interchange stations at Tampines MRT station and Expo MRT station on the Changi Airport Branch line. The stations of the Downtown line were opened on 21 October 2017 as part of DTL3. The 6 stations are:

* **EW2** **DT32** Tampines
* **EW3** Simei
* **DT31** Tampines West
* **DT33** Tampines East
* **DT34** Upper Changi
* **DT35** **CG1** Expo
* **DT36** Xilin (future)
* **CR6** Tampines North (future)

Xilin MRT station is a future underground station as part of the DTL3 extension, which will be completed in 2026, in tandem with Stage 5 of the Thomson–East Coast line.

Tampines North MRT station is another station under construction in Tampines, and will be located in the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub. It is part of the 29-kilometre Phase 1 of the Cross Island line, which will be operational from 2030.


### Bus

There are three bus interchanges — Tampines Bus Interchange, Tampines North Bus Interchange and Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange. All of them are located in Tampines New Town.

Tampines Bus Interchange is the primary bus interchange serving Tampines New Town in Singapore, operated by SBS Transit Ltd and owned by the Land Transport Authority. It complements the high-capacity rail network and supports the hub-and-spoke transport model. Tampines Bus Interchange hosts 23 bus services that cater to approximately 325,000 passengers daily, making it the fourth busiest bus interchange in Singapore. The interchange has evolved from the original Tampines Bus Terminal established in 1983, which was later replaced by a larger temporary terminal to accommodate the increasing population and transport demand.

The current Tampines Bus Interchange, located in Tampines Central, began operations in phases starting in November 1987. Built at a cost of S$5 million, it features 85 bus bays and a comprehensive set of trunk and feeder services linking Tampines to the rest of Singapore. The interchange underwent refurbishments in 2008 to become barrier-free, and again in 2017 to add new alighting berths to prevent bus bunching.

Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange opened on 18 December 2016, to manage peak-hour demand and passenger load at the adjacent Tampines Bus Interchange. It was designated for new services with lower demand.

Tampines North Bus Interchange opened on 27 November 2022 to serve new residents in Tampines North. It will be redeveloped to be part of the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).

Changi Business Park Bus Terminal is a bus terminal in the northern part of Changi Business Park. The terminal, which opened on December 20, 2015, introduced two new Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP) bus services to enhance transportation options around the Changi Business Park.


## Infrastructure


### Transportation depot

The East Coast Integrated Depot (ECID) in Xilin, currently under construction and expected to be completed in 2026, will serve three MRT lines: the East–West Line, the Downtown Line, and the Thomson–East Coast Line. Located beside the soon-to-be-demolished Changi Depot, it will be Singapore's first MRT depot to support three MRT lines and the third to integrate a bus depot. This integrated model is expected to save 44 hectares of land. It will accommodate over 200 trains of various sizes and lengths, along with more than 550 buses.


### District cooling system

Tampines is set to become the first town centre in Singapore to implement a district cooling system, a significant milestone announced on April 18. This innovative Distributed District Cooling (DDC) network will connect seven commercial buildings in Tampines Central. Scheduled to be operational by the first half of 2025, the DDC will utilise the existing cooling systems of these buildings to produce and distribute chilled water through interconnected pipes, thereby providing efficient cooling across the network.

The implementation of the DDC network in Tampines is expected to significantly reduce carbon emissions and achieve substantial energy savings. SP Group and Temasek project that the network will lower carbon emissions by 1,359 tonnes annually, equivalent to removing 1,236 cars from Singapore's roads, and save over 2.8 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy each year, enough to power more than 905 three-room HDB households. By optimising the existing chiller plants and using injection nodes at Century Square, Our Tampines Hub, and Tampines One, the system will enhance cooling efficiency and reduce equipment costs for building owners. This project not only demonstrates the potential for integrating sustainable solutions into existing urban infrastructures but also aligns with Singapore’s broader climate ambitions, contributing to a low-carbon future.


### Emergency services

The 2nd SCDF Division Headquarters, located on the western border of Tampines, has been operational since January 26, 2006. It features an underground command post, which enhances its command and control capabilities during emergencies. A public education centre was also set up to promoting community preparedness. The Tampines Fire Station, co-located with the Division Headquarters, occupies the first two levels of the seven-story building. Staffed by 140 personnel, the fire station's location along the Tampines Avenue 10 thoroughfare allows for rapid response to emergencies in the residential areas of Tampines and Pasir Ris, as well as high-risk premises in the nearby industrial parks.

Tampines Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) is a mid-sized police station in Tampines West. It is under the regional command of the Bedok Police Division. Tampines NPC was one of the first NPCs to adopt the new Community Policing System (COPS), which aims to improve the way NPCs work with the community. Tampines East Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) and Tampines North NPP were also established for residents to access police services with ease, such as submitting police reports and applying for various permits.


### Cycling town

Tampines is Singapore's pioneering cycling town. It established its first dedicated cycling paths as early as 2010. These paths link residential areas in Tampines, with key amenities such as MRT stations and community centres. In 2017, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) recently announced plans to triple the existing 6.9km cycling path network to about 21km, exceeding the cycling infrastructure in other new towns. Enhancements include widening existing paths, improving bicycle crossings with additional signage, and establishing trunk routes connecting Tampines to neighbouring towns and key employment hubs such as Changi Business Park.

This cycling town project aims to promote cycling as a sustainable mode of transport, and enhance the overall liveability and accessibility of Tampines.

In Tampines, there is a wide availability of shared bicycles provided by two operators, HelloRide and Anywheel. These services offer convenient access to bicycles for both residents and visitors, facilitating short trips around the town at low cost.
