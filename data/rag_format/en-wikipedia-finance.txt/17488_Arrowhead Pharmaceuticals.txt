# Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals



**Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.** is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company based in Pasadena, California. Arrowhead’s products in development act through RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms of action. The company focuses on treatments for hepatitis B, liver disease associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cardiovascular disease.


## History

In 2015, the company substantially expanded its intellectual property holdings through complete acquisition of the full RNAi research and development portfolio, and assets from Novartis.

In April 2016, the company announced a name change from Arrowhead Research Corporation to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In September 2016, Arrowhead entered into two collaboration and licensing agreements with Amgen. Under the deals, Amgen received a worldwide exclusive license to Arrowhead’s ARO-LPA RNAi program and an option to a worldwide exclusive license for ARO-AMG1, both for cardiovascular disease.

On Oct. 31, 2018, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. closed on a $3.7 billion license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to develop and commercialize ARO-HBV. As part of the deal, Arrowhead entered into a research collaboration and option agreement with Janssen to potentially collaborate for up to three more RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics against new targets to be selected by Janssen.
