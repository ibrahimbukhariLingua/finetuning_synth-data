On 22 March 2020, Peterside set up the Anap Foundation COVID-19 Think Tank

In May 2020 he was named Co-Chairman (alongside the Finance Minister) of the Steering Committee for the new National Development Plan for Nigeria.

In September 2020, Mr. Peterside was appointed the Co-chairman of the National Steering Committee for Agenda 2050 and the 2021 – 25 Development Plan that was inaugurated by President Buhari. At the inauguration, on 09 September 2020, he made some pertinent opening remarks at the televised Inaugural Meeting of the Steering Committee which held on that same day. The assignment ended when Buhari's tenure ended on 29 May, 2023.

On Friday, 23 October 2020, Atedo Peterside made a landmark appearance on Arise TV's Morning Show from 9am to 10am during which he was interviewed by a panel of 3 journalists. The frank, bold and very informative interview engaged and gripped the nation in the aftermath of the #EndSARS and #EndPoliceBrutality Protests which had attained global attention and which were marred by the tragic Lekki Toll Gate shootings of peaceful protesters who were singing and waving the Nigerian National Flag on October 20, 2020; Bloody Tuesday. In a gripping interview, Atedo Peterside condoled families who had lost loved ones, criticised President Buhari's address to the nation on 22 October 2020, admonished the authorities for illegally trying to block the bank accounts of some of the Protest sympathisers and pointed the way forward for the youths via political activism and the forthcoming 2023 elections.

In late November 2021, Atedo Peterside published an article in major Nigerian newspapers entitled: 2023 elections: Hitting rock bottom, finding a way up.


### The GoNigeria Initiative

GoNigeria is a non-profit, non-party movement dedicated to building a new voice for the young people in Nigeria. The initiative encourages Nigerian youths to become politically active and to register en-masse to vote in future elections. This began with the 2023 General Elections.

Atedo Peterside was the Convener of this Initiative which was launched by Anap Foundation in early December 2021, when Mr. Peterside featured on an exclusive Arise TV interview on Tuesday, 07 December, 2021; in a Question and Answer session with Charles Aniagolu, to explain what the GoNigeria initiative was all about.

The 18 initial Advocates of the GoNigeria Movement are drawn from all the 6 geopolitical zones (3 from each zone). They are: Atedo Peterside (Convener), ‘Yemi Adamolekun, Tomiwa Aladekomo, Osita Chidoka, Dike Chukwumerije, Folarin Falana (Falz), Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, Bishop Matthew Kukah, Hamzat Lawal, Nuruddeen Lemu, Ayisha Osori, Arunma Oteh, Muhammad Ali Pate, Dr. Tony Rapu, HH Muhammad Sanusi II, Dr. Salamatu Hussaini Suleiman, Ibrahim Dahiru Waziri and Aisha Yesufu.

Alongside the advocates, several well-known celebrities were also instrumental in amplifying the GoNigeria message. They include: Mr. Debo Adedayo (Mr. Macaroni), Mo Abudu, Kate Henshaw, Chioma Omeruah (Chigurl), Onyeka Onwenu, Oluwatosin Olaseinde and Bovi Ugboma (Bovi).

To further boost the reach and impact of the campaign, several youth-targeted competitions were launched, where a cumulative of two million Naira per competition was doled out by Anap Foundation to participants who finished 1st, 2nd or 3rd. This began with the GoNigeria Poetry Challenge, where youths aged 18–45 who had their Personal Voters Card (PVCs) were tasked with creating a 30 seconds video encouraging other youths to register, pick up their PVCs and vote in the 2023 General Elections.

This was soon followed by the GoNigeria English Rap Challenge, the GoNigeria Pidgin Rap Challenge, the GoNigeria Comedy Challenge, the GoNigeria Hausa Rap Challenge and the GoNigeria Igbo Rap Challenge. Several youths across the 36 states of the country participated and many were motivated to register and follow-through to get their PVCs.

On Wednesday, 21 December 2022, Atedo Peterside made an appearance on a Channels Television program POLITICS TODAY, where he was interviewed by Seun Okinbaloye. In the interview, Mr. Peterside presented highlights of the 2nd Presidential Election Polls commissioned by Anap Foundation and which was carried out by NOIPolls. The Polls were inconclusive in terms of predicting an outright winner, but firmly established that fresh dynamics had emerged which pointed to a 3-horse race with Peter Obi, of the Labour Party Candidate, unexpectedly slugging it out with Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the ruling All Progressive Congress party and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the People Democratic Party (PDP), whilst Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP was a lone outsider.

Many persons attributed this positive development to the interest that many more educated Nigerian youths were now taking in becoming politically active, spurred on by the work of GoNigeria, Fix Politics and many others.

On Tuesday, 14 March 2023, Atedo Peterside was interviewed by Arise TV's Charles Aniagolu. The detailed and informative interview saw Atedo Peterside drawing attention to the flaws in the electoral process which included apparently falsified Presidential Election Result Sheets which were uploaded on the INEC IREV Server. Mr. Peterside therefore argued that it was premature to congratulate the President-Elect, who emerged from a flawed and tainted process that was now the subject of Election Petitions from his two major opponents.


## Philanthropic work

Peterside founded the **Anap Foundation**, a non-profit organisation that is committed to promoting good governance. He has been the President from inception in 2003.


### Anap Foundation COVID-19 Think Tank

On 18 March 2020, Peterside appeared on Channels Television to warn Nigerians about the danger of complacency, listing four major reasons why Coronavirus disease may hit Nigeria harder than the rest of the world. The video was widely shared on social media. He has also called on the Nigerian government "to use various agencies at its disposal to enforce quarantine following the spread of COVID-19 in the country."

The Anap Foundation COVID-19 Think Tank was founded on 22 March 2020 to help Nigeria overcome the COVID-19 pandemic threat. It is composed of eighteen members from across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria and the diaspora (USA & Germany). These are volunteers "with decades of expertise in medicine, logistics, e-commerce, economics, finance, law, communications, religious knowledge, academia, mobilization, advocacy, sustainability, governance, accountancy, actuarial science, health management organisations, grant making and international disaster management."

The Foundation has also released "Coronavirus Alert" in major Nigerian languages to alert the public to the issues facing the country with the pandemic.

On 4 February, the Anap Foundation COVID-19 Think Tank collaborated with Media Houses to launch a Name and Shame Initiative for violators of the COVID-19 safety protocols.
