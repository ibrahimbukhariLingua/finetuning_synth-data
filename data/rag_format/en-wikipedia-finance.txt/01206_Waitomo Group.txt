Waitomo Group warned of rising fuel prices when the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began in late February 2022.

The Waitomo Group petrol station in Papanui, Christchurch sold out of fuel on 11 March 2022, after the company announced its intention to raise fuel prices. Long queues were reported at other Waitomo stations around the country. The company claimed the wholesale price rise was unprecedented. It denied making the price announcement as a publicity stunt.
