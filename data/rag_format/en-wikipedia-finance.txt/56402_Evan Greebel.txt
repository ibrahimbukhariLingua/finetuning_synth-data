## Conviction and sentencing

After an 11-week trial, Greebel was found guilty in December 2017 of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud for helping Shkreli devise fake settlements and consulting contracts with investors in one of Shkreli's former ventures using the assets of Retrophin. Prosecutors had sought no less than 5 years for Greebel, describing him as a "corrupt lawyer," however, in August 2018, Greebel was sentenced to 18 months in prison, ordered to pay $10.5 million in restitution to Retrophin and to forfeit $116,000.

At his sentencing Judge Kiyo Matsumoto said of Greebel:

“He is not feckless. He is not naive. He is not inexperienced, and he was not led astray by a young, brash CEO.”
