## Biography

Gong was born in China, where he worked as a theatre director, putting on opera and Shakespeare plays. In 2002, he moved to Canada, and in 2008, he obtained Canadian citizenship and abandoned his Chinese citizenship. Gong acquired hotels in Toronto and Michigan, including the Edward Hotel & Convention Center, and started two Chinese-language television stations.

In 2013, Gong became a deputy director on the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and was part of a 2014 Chinese delegation led by vice premier Wang Yang to Finland and Slovenia.

He was known for appearing in a 2016 photo with Justin Trudeau at a Toronto Chinese Community fundraiser. The group is shown making dumplings, Gong's presence drew attention to Mr. Trudeau's cash-for-access dealings.


### Pyramid scheme

Starting in 2017, Gong was investigated by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, the New Zealand Police, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada over his financial dealings. According to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), Gong allegedly fraudulently sold stock in O24, his health-supplements company, to people in China, and stored $140 million in Canadian bank accounts, and most of the remainder in New Zealand bank accounts.

Gong and his company, Edward Enterprise International Group Inc., faced criminal charges in Canada over the scheme. In February 2021, as part of a settlement agreement, Gong pleaded guilty in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (SCJ) on behalf of his company to forging documents and pyramid scheme selling and had his four personal charges withdrawn. Gong had challenged the use of evidence allegedly coerced from him by Chinese authorities. As part of the settlement, the SCJ fined Gong's company, $756,000, imposed a $229,500 victim surcharge and ordered $15 million to be paid to the Canada Revenue Agency.

In June 2021, Gong forfeited NZ$68 million and some Auckland-based property to the New Zealand government as part of a settlement over pyramid scheme activities in the country. According to the New Zealand Police, it was the largest forfeiture of the proceeds of crime in New Zealand history since the implementation of the forfeiture law in 2009. His accounts in the country had previously been frozen in 2018.

In 2022, the Ontario Securities Commission brought a regulatory enforcement case against Gong, arguing that he committed securities fraud and unregistered trading during his operation of the pyramid scheme. In November 2022, Gong challenged the OSC's use of information it had obtained in its investigation that had previously been used in the criminal case. The Capital Markets Tribunal rejected Gong's challenge in February 2023, and that rejection was upheld by the SCJ in June 2023.


### 2023 Toronto mayoral run

In 2023, Gong ran for Mayor of Toronto, with campaign promises including hiring 1,000 new police officers, cutting property taxes by $1,000 and making public transit free to ride for riders aged over 55 or under 18.
