Eurochambres


# Eurochambres



**Eurochambres** is the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The association is a representative organisation in Brussels for businesses in Europe through 42 members (43 national associations of chambers of commerce and industry and two transnational chamber organisations) and a European network of regional and local chambers. It was established in 1958 as a direct response to the creation of the European Economic Community.


## History

Eurochambres was founded 28 February 1958 as the "Conférence Permanente des Chambres de Commerce et d’Industrie de la CEE" by six members, to promote the views of chamber organisations on the unification of national legislation at the European level and to form opinions regarding the modifications to be made to commercial legislation. Another objective of the Conférence was to bring closer competences in order to provide an example of the European cooperation of the highest quality level. The Conférence Permanente held its first assembly in Strasbourg on 28 February 1958. Initial members were national association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Netherlands. The year 1961 saw the creation of the first technical committees and 4 new members joined. A permanent Secretariat was created in 1977 (before the various countries assumed the role in turns).

Eurochambres was registered as an international non-profit organisation in Belgium (AISBL - Association internationale à but non lucratif) in 1977. The network expanded progressively to national associations and transnational organisations of chambers from an enlarged Europe. One of Eurochambres’ most prominent activities is the European Parliament of Enterprises, which is organised in coordination with the European Parliament. The first edition took place in 2008 and gathered some 774 European businesses of all sizes and from all sectors in the European Parliament hemicycle in Brussels. Further editions of the event were also organised in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.

The European Business and Technology Centre and Eurochambers collaborate to foster innovation, cross-border partnerships, and advocate for European businesses' interests at the EU level.
