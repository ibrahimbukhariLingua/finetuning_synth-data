## History

The predecessor of Eesti Gaas was established in 1948, and it was the first gas transport company in Estonia. The company however traces its history to 1865 when the Tallinn Gasworks [et] was opened, which used coal imported from England and gasified there. From 1948–1957 it transported Estonian oil shale gas through the Kohtla-Järve – Leningrad pipeline to Leningrad, Later the pipeline was used in traverse mode to transport Russian natural gas to Estonia.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

From 1963–1988, the company existed as the "General Administration of Gasification" under the Council of Ministers of the Estonian SSR. In 1988, the name 'Eesti Gaas' was first introduced, and in 1990, it became a state enterprise. In 1993, AS Eesti Gaas was incorporated. The company was partly privatized in 1993–1995. In 1993, a 30% stake in Eesti Gaas was transferred to Lentransgaz (now: Gazprom Transgaz Saint Petersburg), a subsidiary of Gazprom, to eliminate the gas debt dispute. In 1994, Ruhrgas (later: E.ON Ruhrgas) acquired about 15% of the company's shares while the management of the company, together with other private investors and the UK-based Baltic Republic Fund, acquired 7.5% of shares both. As a result, the government of Estonia kept a 39% stake. In December 1996, Ruhrgas increased its stake to 21%; 12% was sold to the public. In January 1999, the remaining state-owned shares were sold. Ruhrgas increased its stake up to 32%, Gazprom kept its 30% stake, and Neste (later Fortum) got a 10% stake. Later that year, Itera (now part of Rosneft) Latvian branch acquired nearly 10% stake from the Baltic Republic Fund. In following years, Gazprom increased its stake up to 37%, E.ON up to 33.66%, and Fortum up to 17.7% by buying shares from private investors. In 2014, E.ON sold its stake to Fortum, which became the largest shareholder with 51.4% stake. In February 2016, it was announced that Fortum will sell its stake to Trilini Energy, a company controlled by the investment firm Infortar, the major shareholder of the shipping company Tallink. Later, Trilini also acquired 50.9% of the shares owned previously by Gazprom and 1.15% of the shares owned by minority shareholders.

In 1998, all regional subsidiaries of Eesti Gaas were merged into the parent company. In December 2004, the gas infrastructure construction activities were transferred to the separate subsidiary, AS EG Ehitus. In 2005, the gas grid services (transmission and distribution) were transferred to the newly established subsidiary company EG Võrguteenus. In 2013, the distribution network was separated from EG Võrguteenus into a newly established subsidiary of Eesti Gaas, AS Gaasivõrgud. In 2014, to implement the EU third energy package EG Võrguteenus was separated from Eesti Gaas.

In 2013, Eesti Gaas started to sell electricity.

In January 2018, Eesti Gaas started supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the Tallink's ferry *Megastar*. In October 2018, Eesti Gaas announced that it will order 6,000-cubic-metre LNG barge for bunkering of ships in the northern and eastern part of the Baltic Sea. The barge would be ready by 2020, and it will be built by Damen Group.


## Controversies

Eesti Gaas, faced criticism for its continued import of Russian natural gas following the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite initiating efforts to reorganize its supply chains immediately after the conflict began, the company continued purchasing gas from Gazprom until April 2022. Critics argue that this delay in ceasing Russian gas imports undermined international efforts to economically isolate Russia during the early stages of the conflict.
