The developer was renamed to Atari Melbourne House in May 2003, following the rebranding of Infogrames' subsidiaries under the Atari brand.

#### Humongous Entertainment

Humongous Entertainment was acquired within the purchase of GT Interactive in November 1999, who acquired Humongous themselves in 1996. Humongous were known for developing and publishing the "Junior Adventure" series of children's titles, alongside others. The company also held a subsidiary – Cavedog Entertainment, aimed for more mature titles.

After the purchase, Humongous' co-founders Ron Gilbert and Shelley Day attempted to purchase back the studio from Infogrames, Inc. using external funding, but this was pulled due to the purchase being on the same day as the dot-com collapse. By this point, Infogrames took over publishing rights to their titles, which Humongous previously handled themselves. The founders soon left Humongous, alongside many other key employees, and formed a new studio, Hulabee Entertainment, in 2001.

The studio struggled with titles after this, with Infogrames rejecting a majority of ideas and pressuring them to continue making *Backyard Sports* titles, which Infogrames deemed as the only profit-making brand from Humongous.

In August 2005, Atari, Inc. sold Humongous Entertainment to Infogrames Entertainment itself for shares worth US$10.3 million, effectively dissolving the developer as was. Infogrames then used the assets to form up a new subsidiary, titled Humongous, Inc.

As part of the deal, the assets were transferred to a new Infogrames subsidiary (Humongous, Inc.), while the employees of Humongous Entertainment were laid off. Infogrames is expected to sell Humongous, Inc. further. On the same day, Atari, Inc. signed an agreement with Homongous, Inc. to exclusively distribute the company's games in North America through March 2006, which was later extended through March 2007.

#### MicroProse

MicroProse was acquired within the Hasbro Interactive purchase in January 2001. The brand along with its development teams was known for releasing strategy titles such as *Sid Meier's Civilization* among other franchises such as *X-COM*. MicroProse was purchased by Hasbro in August 1998 following a failed attempted purchase by GT Interactive.

Through 2001 and 2002, Infogrames began a process of phasing out the MicroProse name. Much of MicroProse's Hasbro-era titles and sequels to existing MicroProse titles were released under the Infogrames or Atari brands, and the development teams at Chipping Sodbury and Hunt Valley were rebranded as Infogrames Interactive Chippenham Studio and Infogrames Interactive Hunt Valley Studio respectively. The final two games branded under the MicroProse name were *Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror* and *Grand Prix 4*, released in June and August 2002, respectively. On September 12, 2002, Infogrames announced that the Chippenham studio would close down on the 20th, leading to their then-current project of an Xbox port of *Grand Prix 4* to be shelved. The only remaining ex-MicroProse development studio in Hunt Valley under Infogrames/Atari developed *Monopoly Casino: Vegas Edition* for Windows and later *Dungeons and Dragons: Heroes* for the Xbox, and although surviving under the Atari banner as "Atari Interactive Hunt Valley Studio", Atari announced the studio's closure on November 5, 2003.

In December 2007, the MicroProse trademark and brand name were sold by Atari Interactive to the Interactive Game Group, which filed for transfer of trademark protection on December 27, 2007.
