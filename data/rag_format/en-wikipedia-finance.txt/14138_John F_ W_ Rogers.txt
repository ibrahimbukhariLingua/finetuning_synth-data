He was made a partner in 2000, and "has no revenue-generating responsibilities and strives to have virtually no public profile." He is said to have been United States Treasury Secretary Paulson's closest advisor while at Goldman, as well as a member of United States Secretary of State James Baker's inner circle.

In 2011, CEO Lloyd Blankfein named Rogers one of the eleven executives of the firm. As of 2019, he was executive vice president, chief of staff and secretary to the board of directors at Goldman as well as serving as chairman of the board of directors of the Atlantic Council, the American Atlanticist international affairs think tank.

## Personal life

Lehr, a journalist with Huffington Post, was a former senior negotiator in the Clinton Administration on China trade policy. In 2018, Rogers and Lehr attended President Trump's state dinner with President Emmanuel Macron of France.

According to a 2006 profile in *The New York Times*, Rogers, who is interested in historic preservation, "does not welcome public scrutiny" and hates being photographed. His friends "compare him to the George Smiley character in John le Carré's spy novels. Mr. Rogers, a slight, retiring man with a preference for tan raincoats, brings the kind of technical staff expertise and, his friends say, the ability to gravitate toward the seat of power in bureaucracies that recall Le Carré's spymaster."
