## History

On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord, Leon Abbett, John R. Westerfield, and Julian B. Beaty created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange. In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. The name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co. and its headquarters were moved to 63 Wall Street.

On September 19, 1932, Lord created the American Business Shares investment trust, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched. In 1937, the firm opened its first West Coast branch in Los Angeles. Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms.

In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of different types of fixedâˆ’income securities. In 1975, Lord Abbett moved into pension fund management. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client. In 1978, American Utility Shares was merged into the Lord Abbett Income Fund. The firm's assets under management increased from around $2 billion in 1975 to $4.5 billion in 1983. Ronald P. Lynch and John M. McCarthy became co-managing partners that year after Berndt's death.

In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City. In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. After Managing Partner Ronald Lynch's passing in 1996, there was speculation that the firm would be sold. Lynch's successor, Robert Dow, opted to keep the company independent. Dow (who had previously managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. He also oversaw the firm's move to Jersey City in 2000. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007.

Daria Foster, who had been with the firm since 1990 in various roles, succeeded Dow in 2007. Foster announced that she would retire on March 31, 2018, and that Douglas Sieg would succeed her. On April 2, 2018, Doug Sieg became Lord Abbett's tenth managing partner. He has worked at Lord Abbett since 1994 in various roles, including sales and product strategy, and was "partner, client services" before assuming his current role.

As of June 30, 2024, Lord Abbett managed around $202 billion in assets across a full range of global investment offerings.
