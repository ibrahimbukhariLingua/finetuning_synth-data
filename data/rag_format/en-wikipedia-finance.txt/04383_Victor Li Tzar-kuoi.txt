## Kidnapping

Victor Li was kidnapped in 1996 on his way home after work by notorious gangster "Big Spender" Cheung Tze-keung. Victor's father, Li Ka-shing, paid a ransom of HK$1.038 billion, directly to Cheung who had come to Li Ka-shing's house. Victor Li is said to have been released after one night. A report was never filed with Hong Kong police. Instead the case was pursued by Mainland authorities, leading to Big Spender's execution in 1998, an outcome not possible under Hong Kong law. Rumours circulated of a deal between Li Ka-Shing and the Mainland. This suggestion, when brought to Li, was brushed off.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
