### Free Zone Company

Establishing a business entity in one of the UAE's many Free trade zones (FTZs) can be an attractive option for foreign investors. UAE has over 35 FTZs of which more than 20 are located in Dubai.
The main attraction for setting up a company in a free zone is that there is no UAE national shareholding required. All free zones in UAE offer the following incentives:

* 100% cent import and export tax exemptions
* 100% repatriation of capital and profits
* No currency restrictions

UAE Free Zone companies can only operate within the free zone boundaries and are generally limited to performing solely those activities listed in their license(s).

It is mandatory for every company registered in the Free Zone to lease minimum office space within that particular Free Zone. If the number of employees are few - the company can also lease a co-working space which is located within the freezone. However, if the no. of employees are higher - they would be required to lease a dedicated office space within the freezone. A Free Zone Company can obtain UAE residence visas for the director, shareholder and also employees of the company through the Free Zone where it is registered.

### Limited Liability Company

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 1 (as per Article 8 of the Federal Commercial Company Law of 2015) and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company’s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line.

A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.


### Branch / Representative Office

A branch office has the same legal identity as its parent company and conducts business under the name of its parent company. A branch office may only be engaged in activities similar to those of its parent company but it is not permitted to carry on the business of importing the products of its parent company, a function reserved for local trade agents. In some cases the Branch of a foreign company are required to obtain an additional license from UAE Ministry of Economy.

Representative office, on the other hand, is limited to promoting its parent company’s activities i.e. gathering information and soliciting orders and projects to be performed by the company’s head office.

A UAE national must be appointed as a ‘service agent’ for the branch or representative office.


### Civil Company

A civil company is a business partnership for professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants.
A civil company is 100% owned by the professional partners (except for engineering civil company), however, a UAE National Local Service Agent is normally required.
A foreign company can be a partner in a civil company, as long as the foreign company is in the same field as the civil company.


## Economic Substance Requirements

In 2019, the UAE implemented economic substance requirements for mainland and Free Trade Zone companies engaged in specific "relevant activities" as outlined in the UAE Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 57 of 10 August 2020. These activities include banking, insurance, investment fund management, lease-finance, headquarters, shipping, holding company, intellectual property, and distribution and service centre businesses.

To comply, companies must demonstrate substantial economic presence within the UAE, including conducting core income-generating activities locally, being directed and managed within the country, and maintaining adequate employees, operating expenditure, and physical assets in the UAE.


### Reporting for Economic Substance

UAE companies must annually notify the competent authority about their relevant activities, income, and financial year details, with a submission deadline of 30 June for the preceding year. This requirement applies to all companies, including those exempt from the economic substance obligations, such as investment funds, certain tax residents outside the UAE, and entities conducting business solely within the UAE.

Additionally, companies subject to these requirements must submit an Economic Substance Report within 12 months of their financial year-end, detailing their relevant activities, income, expenses, assets, employees, and confirming compliance with the economic substance test.
