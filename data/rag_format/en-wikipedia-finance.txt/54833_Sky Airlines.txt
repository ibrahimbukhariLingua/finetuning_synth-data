Sky Airlines


# Sky Airlines



**Sky Airlines** was an airline which operated chartered flights. It was based in Antalya, Turkey, operating on behalf of tour operators on short and medium haul routes into Turkey.


## History

The company was established in 2000 and started operations in 2001. It was wholly owned by Kayi Group. In 2010, the airline started scheduled domestic operations in Turkey making it the 9th airline to enter the domestic market. It downsized operations for winter 2012–13, returning three Boeing 737-800s to their lessors.

A subsidiary, German Sky Airlines, based in Düsseldorf, was launched in 2010. On 1 December 2012 it announced a suspension of services (due to the economic downturn) and returned two Boeing 737-800s to their lessors. The airline hoped to resume services in Spring 2013.

On 4 June 2013, the airline filed for bankruptcy, and ceased all flight operations with immediate effect.
