## History

Palamida was founded in 2003,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ with venture financing of $5 million from Hummer Winblad Venture Partners. Founders Jeff Luszcz, Theresa Bui-Friday, and Ray Waldin had previously worked together at Cacheon, Inc. The team had experienced a situation in which open-source software was used within the product’s kernel, which required remediation in order to comply with a potential acquirer’s policy for use of open source. That experience culminated in the founding of Palamida Software. Mark Tolliver, formerly Executive Vice President of Marketing and Strategy at Sun Microsystems, joined Palamida in May 2005 as President and CEO.

Palamida launched its first software product, the Palamida IP Amplifier, in February 2005 at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in Boston. IP Amplifier differed from existing products offered by targeting the software developer. The IP Amplifier suite was intended to run on the developer’s system, in parallel with the software being developed. IP Amplifier was followed by a set of products: Palamida Enterprise Edition, Palamida Standard Edition, and Palamida Compliance Edition, differing in feature sets and functionality.

Palamida was among the early organizers of best practices for utilizing open source software within companies, launching its website, IPIngredients.org and a GPL3 adoption website in 2006.

Palamida maintains a large database of open source projects and licenses.

In addition to a software application, Palamida offers consulting services. These include code reviews and audits for mergers and acquisitions, and baseline audits for existing software products as part of the compliance process within software development organizations. Palamida’s consulting group also offers training and support services to new and existing clients.

Flexera Software acquired Palamida on October 27, 2016.
