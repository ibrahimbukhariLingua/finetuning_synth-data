Our Hong Kong Foundation


# Our Hong Kong Foundation



**Our Hong Kong Foundation** is a Hong Kong think tank focused on the city's social and economic development. It was established in 2014 by Tung Chee-hwa, a former chief executive and a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in response to the 2014 Hong Kong protests.

As the largest think tank in Hong Kong, it conducts public policy research in land, housing, technology, social innovation, the economies of Hong Kong and mainland China, arts, and population. In addition to research, it serves as a group to connect to other interest groups. In the University of Pennsylvania's *2016 Global Go To Think Tanks Report*, Our Hong Kong Foundation ranked the highest amongst all Hong Kong–based think tanks and listed in the Think Tank to Watch in 2017 achievement category.


## History

Tung announced the think tank on 10 November 2014 with 88 advisers that included businesspeople, athletes, academics, and former senior civil servants, including Jack Ma, Lee Wai Sze, Antony Leung, and Yang Chen-Ning. He said the foundation would help develop political leaders in Hong Kong and improve social mobility. Peacefully ending the sit-in protests against the 2014–2015 Hong Kong electoral reform was also described by Tung as one of the foundation's top priorities.

Tung had been the chairman since the think tank was founded. As concerns over his health grew, he resigned as chairman on 28 September 2023 and was succeeded by Bernard Chan. Tung then became the foundation's honorary chairman.


## Political position

Our Hong Kong Foundation has been described as "pro-establishment" or "pro-Beijing". Bernard Chan said his role as the think tank's chairman was to tell “good Hong Kong stories” and advocate for Hong Kong and mainland China internationally. Zheng Yanxiong, the director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office, said the foundation should help integrate Hong Kong into China's development and to work with partners around the world to tell good stories about China.
