Little Bucks


# Little Bucks



Around 2004, **Little Bucks** was a short-lived local retail chain of superstore-like dollar stores around metro Atlanta, and nearby areas of Georgia, United States. Founded in 2002, its seven stores began opening in late 2003, and closed in late February 2005 after going bankrupt.

The name derived from the fact that instead of selling items for a full dollar, it sold everything for 99 cents. The store mascot was an anthropomorphic coin of ambiguous denomination, wearing a cowboy hat and cowboy boots. "Little Buck," as he was called, is short for little buckaroo (slang for cowboy), in turn a pun on the dollar being called a "buck" in common usage, and 99 cents being a smaller amount than a full dollar.

Unlike other variety stores, each had a produce section, selling fresh fruits and vegetables like a grocery store, generally one or two pounds (occasionally three for bananas) for 99Â¢. Each also sold bread, and even Georgia Lottery tickets, taking the extra penny from its own profit margin.
