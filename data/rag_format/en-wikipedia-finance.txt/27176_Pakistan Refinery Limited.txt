# Pakistan Refinery Limited



**Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL)** is a Pakistani oil refinery based in Karachi. Founded in May 1960, it is traded on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.


## History

Soviet Union in the early 1960s offered to assist Pakistan in constructing an oil refinery, with the condition that the facility would exclusively process oil imported from the Soviet Union. In response, the Government of Pakistan approached private sector companies operating in the country, including Shell Pakistan and Esso, proposing a joint venture to build a refinery in Karachi. The private companies, seeking to protect their profits from oil imports, agreed to the government's proposal as an alternative to accepting the Soviet offer. The resulting complex, named Pakistani Oil Refinery, commenced operations in 1964. It was inaugurated by Muhammad Ayub Khan, then President of Pakistan. The design capacity of the refinery was 1 million tons of crude oil per annum but was increased to 2.1 million tons per annum later.
