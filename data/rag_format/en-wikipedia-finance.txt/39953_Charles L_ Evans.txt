## Evans Rules

In December 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to change its broad forward guidance to a more explicit rule. The Evans Rule, a version which had been advocated by Charles Evans for many months, stated that the Committee will hold rates near zero at least until unemployment falls below 6.5% or inflation rises above 2.5%. The Committee in March 2014 decided to remove the mention of the explicit thresholds in its guidance, but emphasized that there has been no change in the stance of monetary policy.
