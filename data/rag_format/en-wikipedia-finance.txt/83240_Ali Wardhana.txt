## Early life and education

Ali Wardhana was born on 6 May 1928, in the city of Surakarta, more commonly known as Solo. His mother died when he was almost five years old. His father, Aliman, would remarry to a woman named Bulik, Ali's aunt. Ali's childhood was mainly spent in Surakarta. Ali moved around several times. Around this time, he reportedly resided in the house of his uncle, Ali Sastroamidjojo, an Indonesian nationalist and statesman, who would go on to become Prime Minister of Indonesia. His childhood home has now become a shop.

Growing up, Ali did not receive a formal education. Instead, he was homeschooled by his stepmother, Bulik. However, he eventually entered formal schooling in 1930 and was immediately placed in the fifth grade of the People's School (now the equivalent of elementary school). He went to the University of Indonesia (UI) and initially studied medicine for a year. However, he withdrew from the faculty, after being cut off by his parents. He continued to study at UI but changed faculties. Choosing the Faculty of Economics, as it provided scholarships. Despite receiving a scholarship, he worked a couple of odd jobs on the side, working at a travel service provider's office.

During his time at UI, he was taught by foreign lecturers from the Netherlands about economics, as the only native economist with an economics doctorate, was Sumitro Djojohadikusumo. However, as tensions grew between Indonesia and the Dutch Government over the West New Guinea dispute, Dutch lecturers began to leave the country. Resulting in UI turning to the Ford Foundation for assistance. The Ford Foundation then began a process where students from UI were chosen to undertake overseas studies at the University of California, Berkeley. After finishing his studies at UI in 1958, and having a short stint as a lecturer at UI, where he was known to be an expert in the fields of macroeconomics and monetary policy, and was able to explain the material briefly and clearly, he was then sent abroad to continue his studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

Ali continued his master's education at the University of California, Berkeley, United States. With the costs of his education being fully funded through the scholarship he received from the Ford Foundation. While in the United States, Ali was particularly interested in fiscal and monetary studies. He managed to complete not only his master's program but also his doctoral program and Master of Arts degree, while in Berkeley. A year later, Ali received a Doctor of Philosophy in 1962, with the dissertation title "Monetary Policy in an Underdeveloped Economy with Special Reference to Indonesia" (1962). During his time in Berkeley, he was supported by several friends, including J.B. Sumarlin and Emil Salim, both fellow future ministers in the New Order.
