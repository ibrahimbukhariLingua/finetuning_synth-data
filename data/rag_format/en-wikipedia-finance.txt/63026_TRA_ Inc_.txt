## Products

TRA's Media TRAnalytics primary reports for TV may be run by TRA’s clients include:
1. The TRA Television Audience Measurement report (TAM), which gathers second-by-second anonymous census-level television audience measurement matched to census-level household demographics. TAM reports include TRA’s Advertising Media Exposure (AME) Report, Audience Retention (AR) Report and Reach Frequency (RF) Report.
2. TRA’s True Target Index (TTI) Report is used to select program vehicles to carry a brand’s advertising in order to reach the largest percentage of the types of purchasers most likely to respond to sales the largest number of times.
3. TRA’s Return On Investment Report (ROI) Report is used to post-evaluate which elements (targets, creative, networks, dayparts, program types, programs, frequency levels) produced the highest ROI so that the next media plan can allocate more heavily to the most productive elements.
These reports tell advertisers, networks and agencies the relative strengths and weaknesses of different creative executions, and how such variables as program environment, time slots, and pod position impact their ROI.
