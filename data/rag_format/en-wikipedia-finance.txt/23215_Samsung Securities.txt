## 2018 Samsung fat-finger error

On 8 April 2018, an employee of Samsung Securities mistakenly distributed shares worth US$100 billion to employees. The error happened when the company tried to pay a dividend to about 2,000 employees who participated in the company stock ownership plan. The intent was to give each of those employees 1,000 South Korean won, worth about US$1, but instead issued 2.8 billion shares. These shares were worth about 112.6 trillion won, or 30 times the market capitalization of the company.

The error caused the price of the company's stock to drop by 11 percent within a day and to fluctuate after that. By 7 May 2018, the company stated that it would file criminal lawsuits against employees who sold their shares during the fat finger incident.
