The Portland Trust


# The Portland Trust



**The Portland Trust** was established to promote peace and stability between Israelis and Palestinians through economic development. It works with a range of partners to help develop the Palestinian private sector and relieve poverty through entrepreneurship in Israel. It facilitates sustainable economic development through catalysing initiatives to build quality employment and thriving private sectors. Their work advances the growth of strong societies in Israel and Palestine based on socio-economic mobility and inclusion for minorities and marginalised groups. (“Who We Are – Portland Trust”)

The Portland Trust was founded in London in 2003 by Sir Ronald Cohen, co-founder and former chairman of the private equity firm Apax Partners, pioneering philanthropist, venture capitalist, and private equity investor, and chair of the Social Impact Investment Taskforce established under the UK's presidency of the G8, together with Sir Harry Solomon, co-founder and former chairman and CEO of Hillsdown Holdings (“Board of Trustees”).

She was also Chief Executive of The Portland Trust itself for eight years, as well as being a director on the European board at Mercy Corps. Also trustees are Jonny Harel-Cohen, of Dynamic Loop Capital, Gila Sacks of the UK Department of Health and Social Care, and Steven Kaye of Baystone Associates Ltd (“Board of Trustees”).

## Roles

The Portland Trust's work encompasses think tank style research as well as working with local partners and stakeholders and the international community to implement catalytic projects towards improving social infrastructure, health, employment and the Palestinian Tech Ecosystem. Its role is both strategic and impactful on the ground, including work on Palestinian Tech Ecosystems such as an IT programme training up hundreds of computer programmers in Palestine. Portland is also involved in ground-breaking projects in the Sakhnin Valley in Israel in health and medtech creating employment opportunities and training for Orthodox Druze women and Arab youth and Haredi men into hi-tech. Portland also helped lay the foundations of Rawabi, Palestine's first and only master planned city, now home to its newest vibrant tech hub.

The Portland Trust conducts extensive research which it publishes in a monthly bulletin called the “Palestinian Economic Bulletin”, which it has been publishing since 2009 in both English and Arabic, and many other publications, such as “Thinking Portland: The Palestinian Tech Ecosystem”.

Despite the many obstacles and restrictions, Portland remains deeply committed to tangible economic development in Palestine. (“Who We Are – Portland Trust”)
