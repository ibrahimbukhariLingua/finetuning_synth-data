## Early life

Born in London, Iyer grew up in India and then Stoke-on-Trent, and went to school at Blurton High School and then Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College, and then read economics at Durham University (BA). As an undergraduate he served as President of the Durham Union. He continued his education at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (MPhil), where he was a Bank of England scholar.

## Career

Iyer joined the civil service, being hired from Boston Consulting Group into the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit in 2008 as part of the UK government's response to the 2007 financial crisis. In 2010 he transferred to HM Treasury as the Deputy Director for Strategy, Planning & Budget, and then as the Head of Financial Sector Interventions.

From 2013 until 2017, Iyer served as India as the FCO's Deputy High Commissioner for Western India, based in Mumbai, and simultaneously as UK Trade & Investment's Director General for Economics, Trade and Commercial Affairs in South Asia, a role currently known as Her Majesty's Trade Commissioner.
