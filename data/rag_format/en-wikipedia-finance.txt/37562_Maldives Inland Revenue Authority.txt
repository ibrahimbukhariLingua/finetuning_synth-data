Maldives Inland Revenue Authority


# Maldives Inland Revenue Authority



The **Maldives Inland Revenue Authority** (MIRA) is a fully autonomous body responsible for tax administration in the Maldives. The main responsibilities of MIRA include execution of tax laws, implementation of tax policies and providing technical advice to the government in determining tax policies. The Tax Administration Act stipulates the other responsibilities of MIRA.


## History

MIRA was established on August 2, 2010, as a separate and independent legal entity. Following the establishment of MIRA, a modern tax system was introduced to the Maldives via the Tourism Goods and Services Tax Act in January 2011 and the Business Profit Tax Act in July 2011. The Tourism Goods and Services Tax Act was replaced by the Goods and Services Tax Act in October 2011.


## Laws & Regulations Administered

MIRA administers a number of laws and regulations. In addition to the administration of tax laws, MIRA also collects a number of fees and levies.
