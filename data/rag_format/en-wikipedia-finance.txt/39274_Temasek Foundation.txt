Temasek Foundation


# Temasek Foundation



**Temasek Foundation International** is a Singapore-based non-profit organisation under the philanthropic arm of the Singapore state sovereign fund Temasek Holdings. Temasek has established 17 endowments since 1974, focused on promoting social and cultural interaction, education, and aid for the disadvantaged in Asia.

It is under the financial oversight of Temasek Trust, the endowment trustee of Temasek Holdings. The other foundations under the Trust's financial oversight include Temasek Foundation Cares, Temasek Foundation Connects, Temasek Foundation Nurtures, Temasek Foundation Innovates, and Temasek Foundation Ecosperity.

As of 2016, over S$2 billion has been given to community initiatives covering a wide range of sectors and demographic groups, both locally and regionally, benefitting more than 300,000 people in Singapore and across Asia.


## History

Temasek was formed in 1974 following the amalgamation of some 35 companies previously owned by the Singaporean Ministry of Finance. This was done following the government’s decision to commercialise former British naval and military zones.

The government had been left with these zones in the wake of the British announcement to withdraw from Singapore in 1967, which was then promptly adjusted to 1971. At the 40th anniversary of Temasek in 2014, then President of Singapore,Tony Tan Keng Yam spoke of the Singaporean government’s decision to do this, saying: “It was clearly not the business of government to run such enterprises, and so Temasek was set up to take over and own some 35 companies and miscellaneous investments.”

In 2003, Temasek instituted a policy of setting aside a share of its excess returns for the community for each year Temasek exceeded its risk-adjusted cost of capital.

In 2007, the Temasek Trust was established to provide financial oversight for and governance of Temasek's endowment gifts to its non-profit Philanthropic Organisations (NPPOs). This allowed their NPPOs to focus on the implementation and management of its social and community programmes.

In 2016, Temasek was restructured into six foundations, in an attempt to reaffirm its ongoing commitment to the wider community in Singapore and beyond.

Also in 2016, Temasek established the Temasek Philanthropic Platform, reaffirming its ongoing commitment to the wider community in Singapore and beyond, and signaling the next phase of its community investment journey. The platform comprises the Temasek Trust, the Temasek Family of Six Foundations and Temasek Foundation Management Services.

The Foundation manages two endowments - the Singapore Millennium Foundation and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory.


#### Singapore Millennium Foundation

The Singapore Millennium Foundation (SMF) was set up as a charity and IPC in 2001 by the then Singapore Technologies Pte Ltd (STPL). Since 2011, it has been a Temasek Trust-supported non-profit organisation that promotes research through the awarding of post graduate research scholarships and funding of research programmes in the areas of ageing, palliative care, pedagogy and learning, special needs education, and non-medical bio-science. Its ethos is promoting research as an endeavour to help humanity.

More than 200 post graduate research scholarships have been awarded as at 2010. These scholarships supported clinician scientists in their research. A number of SMF scholars have attained faculty positions in local Universities and/or continued their research at universities and research institutes locally and abroad.

In 2010, the SMF discontinued its scholarship schemes and channeled its funds to support smaller, more niche research programmes in Singapore. Some supported research programmes include Liver Cancer, Parkinson Disease, Neuromuscular Disease, Bio-fuel and Mental Health.

In 2011, SMF initiated grant calls to researchers from NUS, NTU, NIE and other selected research institutes. To date, research grants have been awarded in Pedagogy and Learning/Special Needs Education, Ageing, Palliative Care, and Non-Medical Bio-Science.

A second grant call inviting more research proposals in these areas was launched in December 2012. There have been five grant calls since, with a sixth grant call in progress.

It also strives to develop and nurture a vibrant ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as promote sustainable best practices and standards.

Temasek Foundation Ecosperity has supported the development and engineering of the AIR+ Smart Mask and Airbitat Smart Cooler.


#### AIR+ Smart Mask

In 2013, Temasek and ST Engineering piloted the AIR+ Smart Mask project to provide N95 protection to Singapore communities, in particular children, from the harmful effects of haze.

It has the world's first attachable and rechargeable micro ventilator that extracts moisture, carbon dioxide, and heat trapped within the mask for better comfort. With the micro ventilator, it is able to reduce relative humidity inside the face mask by up to 40% and reduce temperature by up to 4°C.


#### Airbitat Smart Cooler

The Airbitat Smart Cooler was developed by Innosparks, an ST Engineering subsidiary, to provide outdoor cooling in Singapore (down to around 24°C) in an environmentally sustainable way. It is the world's first energy-efficient evaporative cooling system with only 20% the energy consumption of an average air conditioner – making it ideal for commercial, industrial, and recreational spaces.
