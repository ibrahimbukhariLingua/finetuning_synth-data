## Emigration issues

In 2001 Niels Stolt-Nielsen notified Norwegian authorities that he was living abroad having his residence in London and stopped paying taxes in Norway. The tax authorities contested this in 2001, however Stolt-Nielsen's assertion was accepted for the 2002 - 2004 tax years due to a clerical error. In 2005 the error was discovered and the authorities claimed Stolt-Nielsen owed taxes from 2001 to 2004, and for 2005, as well. The tax authorities were subsequently sued by Stolt-Nielsen and in a November 2007 it was ruled that Stolt-Nielsen had a permanent residence at Frogner in Oslo.
