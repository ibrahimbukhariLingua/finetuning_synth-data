## History

The Savings Bank's heritage started in early 1869 with the idea of Cyrus Wakefield who, along with other business leaders, petitioned for a charter to open a savings bank in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Starting with one physical location in 1869, the bank was chartered as the Wakefield Savings Bank. By 1871, the Wakefield Savings Bank had over $60,000 in deposits and over 500 depositors.

In 1981, The Savings Bank earned national and international recognition with the opening of the first student-operated banking branch in the nation, named the 1st Educational Savings Branch at Wakefield Memorial High School. In 2004, the branch was awarded an honorary certificate of recognition by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for its efforts in teaching financial literacy to high school students.

In 1985, The Savings Bank became FDIC insured and was assigned the FDIC certification number 90291.

In 1989, the bank's name changed to The Savings Bank to reflect its broader geographic footprint.

In 1997, the Trust Department of the bank was established, and the bank expanded its services to include Wealth Management services.

In 2005, The Savings Bank acquired the First Financial Trust, N.A.

In early 2013, The Savings Bank petitioned the Division of Banks (Division) and the Board of Bank Incorporation (Board) pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapters 167A and 167H, for permission to reorganize into a mutual holding company.

In early 2023, The Savings Bank added an addition adjacent to the Bank's Main Office at 357 Main Street. The two-story expansion houses the bank's Commercial Banking, Human Resources, Training, Facilities, and IT departments.

In June 2023, The Savings Bank changed its website address from www.tsbawake24.com to www.tsbdirect.bank. A domain ending with .bank helps prevent cyberattacks through added layers of protection.
