# Metro Brands



**Metro Brands**, previously known as **Metro Shoes**, is an Indian multi-brand footwear retail company based in Mumbai. Metro Brands operates a network of 598 Metro showrooms across 136 cities in India.


## History

Metro started as a standalone shoe store in 1955 in Colaba, Mumbai. It was named after the Metro Cinema, which was located nearby. The company was incorporated in January 1977 as Metro Shoes.

In 2013, the company announced it was able to expand the number of its retail stores due to low rental rates, particularly in tier II cities.

In 2015, Metro signed an agreement with Crocs to open exclusive Crocs stores in India.

In December 2021, the company launched its ₹1,367.5 crore (US$160 million) initial public offering (IPO).

In March 2023, Metro Brands Limited reappointed Vikas Vijaykumar Khemani as an independent director.


## Controversy

In December 1996, Managing Director Rafique Malik, was among several businessmen and politicians arrested by Mumbai Police on charges of misappropriation of concessionary funds allocated to cobblers and artisans. The case is *sub judice* as of 2018.
