# LendingPoint



**LendingPoint** is a financial technology platform. The company looks at a person's complete financial picture, taking into consideration credit history, employment history, earning potential, and other data to determine creditworthiness. LendingPoint gives access to more affordable loans for consumers with credit scores between 500 and 850 and discounts traditional creditworthiness factors, such as FICO scores, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and payment-to-income (PTI) ratios. It was founded in 2014 by Tom Burnside, Franck Fatras, Victor J. Pacheco, and Juan E. Tavares.
