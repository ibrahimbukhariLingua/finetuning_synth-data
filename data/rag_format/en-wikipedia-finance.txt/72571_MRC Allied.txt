**MRC Allied Inc.** (MRC) is a property development firm in the Philippines. It is a publicly listed property development firm which has a position in the development of master planned, integrated residential, commercial, recreational, tourism and industrial areas within a single community or township.


## History

MRC Allied, Inc. (MRC) is the first publicly listed property development firm in the Philippines which has found its niche in development of master planned, integrated residential, commercial, recreational, tourism and industrial areas within a single community or township.

Incorporated on November 20, 1990, and formerly known as Makilala Rubber Corporation, the activities of MRC have been primarily on processing and export of baled natural rubber. In 1993, MRC diversified into a real property development firm, more particularly, into township development. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the change of name of Makilala Rubber Corporation to MRC Allied Industries, Inc. on October 25, 1994.

In 1995, MRC listed its entire 500 million shares in the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) with an initial public offering share price of three pesos (P3.00) per share. MRC decided to divest its rubber business to Makrubber Corporation in 1997, its wholly owned subsidiary, to focus on its core business – real property development. Makrubber had to stop its operations in 2000 due to the Land Reform Program and the peace and order problems in North Cotabato.

Since 2000, MRC has continued and maintained its two eco-friendly projects: the New Cebu Township One (NCTO) of Naga, Cebu; and Amihan Woodlands Township (AWT) of Northern Leyte.

In 2010, MRC has ventured into the mining exploration industry acquiring various mining assets located in the provinces of Davao del Sur, Sultan Kudarat, Surigao del Sur, and Davao Oriental.

In 2015, MRC decided to diversify its portfolio and revealed its plan to venture into the renewable energy sector through the a newly created subsidiary Menlo Renewable Energy Corporation and is set to implement its very first renewable energy project – the 60MW Solar Project in Naga City, Cebu.


## MRC Allied portfolio

Property Development

The company has two land banks consisting of 160 hectare industrial estate in Naga City, Cebu known as the New Cebu Township One (NCTO) and 700 hectares of raw land in San Isidro Municipality, Leyte known as Amihan Woodlands Township (AWT).

Both parcels of land are registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). Based on the latest appraisal, the properties have a fair market value of Php1.5 billion.

The New Cebu Township One (NCTO) Ecozone

The New Cebu Township One (NCTO) represents MRC's first major property development undertaking. As a master-planned economic zone designed by renowned Jurong Town Corporation, NCTO is envisioned to become a wholly integrated community, which contains a light industry, processing zone, residential, commercial and recreational areas.

Located in the heart of Naga City, Cebu and about thirty five (35) kilometers away from the Mactan International Airport, the NCTO is registered with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) as a special economic zone. At present, the lead locator in the park is Kinseki Ltd., a Japanese manufacturer of Quartz and Crystal devices. Other major locators are Seagate Technology, Inc. of the United States, Air Liquide of France and AP Precisions Philippines, Inc. Further development is required to fully maximize the value of this 50-hectare property.

Within the ecozone, MRC also plans to develop its 50 megawatt solar power plant that can either supply electricity to the Visayas grid and offer its power to consumers within and around Naga City, Cebu. The solar farm is currently in its pre-development phase.

The Amihan Woodlands Township (AWT)

Located in the Municipality of San Isidro, Leyte with a lot area of around 732 hectares, the Amihan Woodlands Township (AWT) Inc. was originally planned as an eco-residential and eco-tourism project with economic zone status. However, the company was negatively affected by the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and due to its present financial condition, no major development of the property has been undertaken.

The open spaces and woodlands consist of the natural forest, mangrove swamps, beaches and marine preserves which will be protected sanctuaries and which will serve as the centerpoint of the property development. The residential areas for locators are divided into three districts. The large mixed-use areas will contain commercial, recreational and residential zones. It can accommodate locators and investors to establish resort facilities, hotels, and condominiums, and world class golf courses.

The industrial park will permit light industrial activities and other parallel uses. This will also be the site of the port operation facilities of the seaport and the airport. The remaining areas are reserved for infrastructure facilities and utilities which include an airport, seaport/marina, a lake/water reservoir, and road network.
