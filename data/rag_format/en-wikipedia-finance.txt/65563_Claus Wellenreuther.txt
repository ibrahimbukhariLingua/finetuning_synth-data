Afterwards Wellenreuther worked at IBM in Mannheim, where he was responsible for developing financial accountancy systems. In 1971 he left IBM to program a standard financial accountancy system with batch processing. He then joined his former IBM colleagues Hasso Plattner, Dietmar Hopp, Hans-Werner Hector and Klaus Tschira to found the software company ***S**ysteme, **A**nwendungen und **P**rodukte in der Datenverarbeitung* in Weinheim, which would later become the SAP AG. Wellenreuther was primarily responsible for the architecture and the concept of the SAP R/2 financial accountancy module.

In 1982 he founded *DCW Software* (Dr. Claus Wellenreuther GmbH & Co. KG), which he developed into a specialist for middle-sized ERP software. The company was acquired by SAP in 2003. The "deal among friends" was heavily criticized by DCW customers that had explicitly decided for an alternative to SAP. In 2004 DCW was merged with the SAP subsidiary *Steeb Anwendungssysteme GmbH*.
