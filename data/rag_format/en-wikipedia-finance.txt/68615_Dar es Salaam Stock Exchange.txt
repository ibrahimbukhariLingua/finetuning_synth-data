## History


### Incorporation

The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange was established by the capital markets and security authority under the Capital Markets and Securities (CMS) Act of 1994 in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania. The stock exchange was incorporated on 19 September 1996. The company was incorporated as a private company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital under the Companies Ordinate, therefore the DSE is a non-profit making body.

The exchange became operational on 15 April 1998 with TOL Gas Limited listing as the first company followed by the Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) during the same year. The delay was due to the necessary background operational preparations that were inevitable such as training of brokers and formulation of issuance and trading rules.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
