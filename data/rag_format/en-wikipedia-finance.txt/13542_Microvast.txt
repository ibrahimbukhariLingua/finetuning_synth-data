### Canceled federal grant

On Oct. 19, 2022 the U.S. Department of Energy released *"Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing & Recycling Funding Opportunity Announcement"*, awarding US$2.8 billion to a number of public and private US companies. The company was awarded US$200 million to support development of a Thermally Stable Polyaramid Separator Manufacturing Plant in Clarksville, Tennessee, in partnership with General Motors. The federal grant generated criticism from U.S. representative Frank Lucas and U.S. senator John Barrasso.

In May 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled the $200 million award to Microvast. A planned Microvast plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky was halted as a result.
