**ENMTP** (from **Entreprise Nationale des Materiels de Travaux Publics**) is an Algerian company specializing in the development, manufacture and distribution of machinery used in public works. It has registered capital of 15.6 billion DA and is 100% owned by the state.

Following the restructuring of the Sonacome and SN METAL, the National Company of heavy equipment "ENMTP" was transformed into joint stock company in 1995.

The ENMTP Group produced materials under licenses acquired from recognized manufacturers, such as:

Liebherr (Germany) for excavators, cranes, bulldozers and large shippers
O & K (Germany) for loaders
INGERSOLL RAND CO (United States) in the field of compressors and compactors
POTAIN (United States) for the production of building cranes
Braud & Faucheux for manufacturing concrete mixers
and materials developed with the company's internal skills: backhoe loaders, Graders, BTS Press and various small products

The industrial potential of ENMTP Group is considered one of the largest in Africa. It is structured according to specialization by product lines. Each unit have the largest industrial autonomy.

ENMTP manages a sizeable industrial potential involving 2,400 workers who generated a turnover of US$60 million in 2006, and expects US$70 million by the year 2007 with a 2,350-strong workforce.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

This potential is mainly organized in the main engineering industries and related products:
public works equipments (excavators, hydraulic cranes, loaders, bulldozers, etc.),
compactors and compressors, and
