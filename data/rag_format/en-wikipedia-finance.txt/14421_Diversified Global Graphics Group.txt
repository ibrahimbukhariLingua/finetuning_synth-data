## History


### 1983–1989

DG3 traces its roots back to 1983, when Michael Cunningham formed Cunningham Graphics International Inc. (CGI) in the United States. CGI served the financial service industry as a print broker. In 1989, CGI established itself in the New York City area as a print manufacturer, specializing in printing time-sensitive investment research for the financial service industry.


### 1990–1999

In 1990, CGI shifted its focus to the globalization of financial markets. As a result, CGI formed a strategic alliance with both Roda Print in London and Workable in Hong Kong. Roda Print was known for developing and producing fast-turnaround printing services for the investment banking community in London. Workable was known as the printer of choice for Hong Kong's finance industry.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The alliance between the three companies formed the World Research Link (WRL). WRL specialized in simultaneous printing and distribution across multiple time zone for CGI's global clients.

Throughout the 1990s, CGI focused on acquiring the in-house print facilities of major financial institutions. In all, CGI acquired ten in-house production operations from the twenty top financial institutions in the world, while providing non-exclusive services to an additional three.

In 1998, CGI completed its initial public offering on Nasdaq (NM: CGII) and acquired Roda Print and Workable Printing Limited in Hong Kong. In addition, CGI acquired several other printing firms and completed additional outsourcing transactions in the United States. In the first year of public offering, CGI saw a gain of 71% over the previous year's earnings.


### 2000–2006

In June 2000, CGI was acquired by the world's largest payroll processing and financial services back office processing firm — Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NYSE: ADP). The business changed its name to ADP Graphic Communications and operated as part of ADP's Investor Communications Division. In 2004, Peter Furlonge acquired CGI Europe Limited, CGI Asia Limited, CGI Japan Limited and CGI Pacific Limited from ADP in a management buyout to form The CGI Group. Furlonge then completed the acquisition of a large digital print business called 3D Digital Ltd. and formed CGI Squared, a technology-focused creative communications business in Birmingham, England of which John White was Managing Director.

In 2006, Peter Furlonge acquired the US graphic communications businesses from ADP, reforming the CGI business to look like the company before its acquisition by ADP.

David Klaiss was promoted to President of the North American business and played a leading role in stabilizing the company and returning it to profit.


### 2007–present

In 2007, CGI changed its name to Diversified Global Graphics Group — DG3, and award-winning entrepreneur Michael Cunningham returned as Group Chief Executive Officer.

In 2008, DG3 received a substantial investment from Arsenal Capital Partners and appointed Larry Bloch as Chairman. In that same year, DG3 acquired PharmAid Industries, a supplier of communications services to pharmaceutical firms and Pace Press, a New York area commercial print provider. In addition, DG3 formalities Computershare Communication Services, a Computershare Limited (ASX: CPU) business, to deliver an improved shareholder communication model to public companies worldwide. DG3 also opened a facility devoted to rapid-response worldwide fulfillment.
