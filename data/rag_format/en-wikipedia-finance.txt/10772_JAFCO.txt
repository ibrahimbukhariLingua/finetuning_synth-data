## Alleged Misconduct


### Sexual Assault Incident

In October 2024, multiple male employees of JAFCO Group were reported to have sexually assaulted a female contract worker. According to the woman’s account, she faced persistent harassment from shortly after joining the company in 2018, including late-night phone calls and pressure to attend drinking sessions. In December 2019, following a year-end party, she alleges that one of the employees strangled her with a scarf and touched her chest. Disciplinary actions were taken against the perpetrators; however, the woman was subsequently encouraged to resign and forced to renew her contract at half her previous salary. She was ultimately laid off in 2022.

While the victim is pursuing legal action, JAFCO Group denies any link between her dismissal and her sexual harassment complaints. Reporting on the incident has drawn parallels to broader concerns in Japan, where 52.4% of female entrepreneurs have reported experiencing some form of harassment within the past year. The case has also brought attention to how sexual harassment issues are addressed industry-wide, including by the Japan Venture Capital Association.

On November 20, 2024, the victim’s legal representative sent letters to seven companies that co-invest with JAFCO, asking them to urge JAFCO—from their position as investors—to provide a formal apology, compensation, and to improve the workplace environment. Of those seven companies, four (Chugoku Electric Power, Intec, Azbil, and Chudenko) formally requested that JAFCO “respect human rights” and “implement preventive measures against harassment, including secondary harassment.” Meanwhile, the Development Bank of Japan, Moriroku Holdings, and Hokkaido Electric Power stated that they would not comment.

The request is based on the “United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs),” adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2011, which encourages businesses to address human rights issues. Specifically, the request calls for:

1. A formal apology and compensation for the victim.
2. Creation of a workplace environment that prevents further sexual harassment.
3. Establishment of mechanisms and policies to prevent recurrence.
