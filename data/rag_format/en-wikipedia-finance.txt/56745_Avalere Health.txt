## History

Avalere was founded as The Health Strategies Consultancy LLC in 2000 by Dan Mendelson. In 2008, Mendelson sold a minority interest of the company to ABS Capital Partners, a Baltimore, Maryland–based private equity firm. On September 1, 2015, Inovalon (Nasdaq: INOV), a leading technology company headquartered in Bowie, Maryland, providing an integrated cloud-based platform that enables healthcare organizations to implement large-scale highly sophisticated data-driven initiatives, acquired Avalere. Avalere operated as a subsidiary with a focus on providing advisory services on market consolidation, cost management, quality improvement, and managed care as well as business intelligence and corporate communication strategies. The firm has also published studies on drug plan coverage and managed care plans in the US. Avalere was acquired by Avalere Health (previously known as Fishawack Health) in June 2022.
