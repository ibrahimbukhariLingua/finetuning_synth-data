# Grana (fashion company)



**Grana** is an online fashion company based in Hong Kong. It has an offline showroom called “The Fitting Room” in Hong Kong, where customers try on clothes and order online. It was cofounded by Luke Grana and Pieter-Paul Wittgen and officially launched in October 2014. The first brick-and-mortar store opened in Hong Kong in September 2015.


## Products

The company sources its products directly from fabric mills, which reduces markup pricing. Grana clothing products include silks, linen, cashmere, merino, tencel, pima cotton and baby alpaca wools. The fabrics are sourced internationally from a variety of countries including China, France, Mongolia, Austria, Peru and Italy. Grana’s ‘new luxury’ brand focuses its ethic on sustainable fashion setting itself apart from mass consumerism. Central to Grana’s business and production is ethical manufacturing.
