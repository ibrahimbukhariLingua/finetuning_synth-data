Prior to the May 26, 1896, inception of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Charles Dow's stock average consisted of the Dow Jones Transportation Average. The average was created on July 3, 1884 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, as part of the *Customer's Afternoon Letter*. From its inception (until May 26, 1896), the Dow Jones Transportation Average consisted of eleven transportation-related companies: nine railroads and two non-rail companies (Western Union and Pacific Mail).
