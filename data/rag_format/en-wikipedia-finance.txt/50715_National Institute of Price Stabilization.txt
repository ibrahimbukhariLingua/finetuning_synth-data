## 2012-2016 Administration

During the current administration, Jorge Radhamés Zorrilla Ozuna has developed important initiatives to help local producers, consumers, and the institution which has contributed to improve the financial situation of producers, consumers, and suppliers.

The new philosophy of the institution is to “offer support and services in the national agricultural system in order to improve the profitability and competitiveness of local producers as well as the purchase power of consumers, specifically those of lower income”.

The institution's functions are:

* Provide agricultural producers with the necessary storage infrastructure, through loans or leases, so they can face fluctuations in the market behavior.
* Promote the creation of markets in which national agricultural producers can sell their products, benefitting themselves and consumers by diminishing intermediaries.
* Identify and promote new investment opportunities in the agricultural sector.
* Stablish capacitation centers for producers to increase their ability to manage agricultural commercialization.
* Reinforce the institution's role as a mediator in the agricultural sector, to help solve conflicts between interest groups.
* Promote the creation of packaging centers in production zones to increase the added value to agricultural production.
