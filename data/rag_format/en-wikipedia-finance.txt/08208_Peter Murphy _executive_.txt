## Disney

He was responsible for strategy, new business development, mergers and acquisitions, technology, brand management, and long term planning for the growth of Disney's global businesses. The "Strategic Planning" department he headed was reviled by other Disney employees and was blamed by some for supposed missteps Disney took towards the end of the Eisner era. During his tenure the company grew from ~$5 billion in revenue to over $35 billion, driven by the acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC which Murphy spearheaded. Other high-profile acquisitions he led include Miramax Film Corp, Fox Family Worldwide and The Muppets. He was recognized by The Hollywood Reporter in their “Next Generation: Hollywood’s Top 35 Executives under 35” list and lectures regularly at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
