## Structure


### History

Business education at Florida State traces its roots to 1916 when the Florida State College for Women (FSCW) established a two-year program in business education within the College of Arts and Sciences. Ten years after its beginning, the two-year business program became a four-year program leading to a bachelor's degree. Returning soldiers using the G.I. Bill after World War II stressed the state university system to the point that a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field. By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it Florida State University. In 1950, a separate establishment was founded as the School of Business. Although the School of Business was formally established in 1950, its first class graduated on December 15, 1949, when 27 students received Bachelor of Science degrees in business.

In the 1960s, both undergraduate and graduate programs were accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International) and were producing more than 10 percent of the university's total headcount enrollment.

In 1974, the School of Business was designated the College of Business.


### Departments

There are 6 departments housed in the College of Business:

* Department of Accounting
* Department of Business Analytics, Information Systems and Supply Chain
* Department of Finance
* Department of Management
* Department of Marketing
* Department of Risk Management/Insurance, Real Estate & Legal Studies

The College of Business is presently located near the new Student Union and across from Bellamy Building (BEL) and the Huge Classroom Building (HCB). Housed in Rovetta Business Annex (RBA) and Rovetta Business Building (RBB), the college is located in the northeast section of the main Tallahassee campus, comprising 463 acres.

It will be located next to the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center and be part of the Arena District. It will be the largest academic space on FSU's campus with five floors, a central atrium, forum stairs with seating, a 300-seat auditorium, multipurpose event space and a financial trading room. Legacy Hall is part of FSU's top legislative priorities, and is currently expected to be completed in the summer of 2025.
