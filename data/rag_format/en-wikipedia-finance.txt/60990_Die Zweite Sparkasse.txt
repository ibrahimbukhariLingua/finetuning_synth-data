## Description


### Services

Zweite Sparkasse provides banking services to clients in financial problem situations. Only people referred to Zweite Sparkasse via one of the cooperating advisory organisations are accepted as clients. On the basis of this recommendation, the new client is provided with an account, initially for a three years term, on a credit basis only and not allowing any overdrafts.

The account is debited with a so-called "account management charge" of €9 per quarter, which is refunded to the client when they change to a conventional commercial bank and the second account is closed. Clients are given an ATM card free of charge based on the Maestro system.

Zweite Sparkasse also offers a "permanent account" to allow customers additional time to sort out their financial problems, and "managed accounts" from which essential payments are made automatically. All clients are issued a basic insurance package when opening an account: free legal advice every three months, small accident insurance policy, household insurance (premium).


### Organization

Zweite Sparkasse is a bank. The difference between Zweite Sparkasse and conventional banks consists in its social purpose, its volunteering consultants, and its not-for-profit status.

Zweite Sparkasse cooperates closely with Caritas and the Austrian debt counselling services. In Vienna and some other provincial locations Zweite Sparkasse cooperates with numerous other non-governmental organisations.
