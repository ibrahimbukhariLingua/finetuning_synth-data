## Political career


### European Parliament

Lauk is a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, part of the European People's Party. He was a Member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2009, during which time he served on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and a deputy member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.


### Economic Council

From 2000 until 2015, Lauk served as president of the Economic Council of the Christian Democratic Party, a business-based advisory group closely affiliated with the party yet not officially part of it. In this capacity, he was also an adviser to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

As head of the Economic Council, Lauk advocated a more forceful discussion of economic issues in Germany and has been highly critical of Merkel’s economic policies. He has been a vocal critic of Merkel's reluctance to introduce bold economic reforms, often arguing that she has been bowing to pressure from the Social Democratic Party over several major issues, including the introduction of a minimum wage and pensions increases. On government proposals to cut the retirement age for veteran workers to 63 and increase pensions for mothers in 2014, Lauk argued that Germany was setting "a bad example" not only for vulnerable southern European nations but also for France.

In 2010, Lauk described German industry as "the infrastructure provider to emerging countries" for the next 10 years, yet warned that promising areas like software, biogenetics and nanotechnologies were lacking. As for Germany's role as world export leader, he argued that the country's current weakness suggested that over the next decade it could probably sink to a middling place in the global top ten.

In a 2015 letter published in *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*, Lauk wrote to German lawmakers urging them to vote against the Merkel government’s proposal for a four-month extension of Greece's bailout, arguing that "a simple extension of the aid program without effective terms would mean that we are knowingly throwing further good money after bad".

## Controversy

In September 2019, Lauk filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging Vista Equity Partners sought to use its control of Solera Holdings' board for its own benefit by urging its directors – including himself – to buy at inflated prices other companies the firm owns. He also argued that he was removed from his position on the board of directors in May 2019 after he demanded an investigation into what he alleged was Vista’s “self-dealing.” In a response, Vista denied all charges and argued instead that Lauk was a “crony” of Solera’s former CEO Tony Aquila who had been fired in May 2019 over allegations of “aggressive and abusive” behavior.
