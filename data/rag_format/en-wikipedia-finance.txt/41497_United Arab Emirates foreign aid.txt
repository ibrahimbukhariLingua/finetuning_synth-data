## History

Foreign aid first began with one of the oldest development agencies in the UAE, called Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, founded in 1971. Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) assists countries through economic support in the form of concessionary loans to reach sustainable socio-economic progress.


## Administration

In February 2006, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Following a restructure of the cabinet in 2016 led to the creation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, where one of its several tasks is to overlook development aid by the UAE.
The UAE's official development assistance (ODA) measured as a share of Gross National Income achieved 1.17% in 2014 and 1.12% in 2016. This is higher than the United Nations' agreement for countries to give 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) as official development aid yearly, ranking the UAE as highest contributor of all countries reporting to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC). The UAE also provides funding that falls beyond the scope of Official Development Assistance. According to the OECD, 2020 official development assistance from UAE decreased by 26.3% to US$1.7 billion.
