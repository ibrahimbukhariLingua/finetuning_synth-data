## Reviews

The review in *The Spectator* noted that this book is "a meticulous historian's collection of facts, backed by a lifetime's work."

A reviewer for the British Scholar Society said that the "chapters that make up this book are more extended vignettes than comprehensive surveys, offering a short narrative built around a handful of examples and statistics."

Another reviewer said that while the book purports to be an introductory text, it may in fact be too advanced for a beginner, but still - "..no other 'introduction' to India covers more ground than Rothermund's book."
