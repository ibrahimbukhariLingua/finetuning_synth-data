## Business career


### Canoo Technologies, Inc.

Tony Aquila was an initial investor in Canoo, before becoming a member of the Board. He was named Board Chair in October, 2020, and CEO in March 2021. Utilizing their Multi-Purpose Platform, they planned to build multiple variants of vehicles, MPDV (Multi Purpose Delivery Vehicle), and upcoming Canoo Sports Vehicle. The LV was planned for production in late 2022. The MPDV, Truck, and Sports Car were planned for 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. Under an agreement established in November 2020, Canoo reimbursed Aquila Family Ventures, a company owned by Canoo's CEO, for the use of a private aircraft, with expenditures amounting to $1.7 million in 2023, surpassing the company’s $886,000 in revenue for that year. Additionally, Canoo compensated Aquila Family Ventures for shared services support at its Justin, Texas, corporate office, totaling another $1.7 million in 2023, as detailed in regulatory filings.

He left Solera in 2019, and later sued them for breach of contract, though the lawsuit was ultimately tossed out of court. In court filings, Solera claimed Aquila was fired for cause, that he charged the company for private jet flights that were for his personal use, and that his “brash, vulgar, and belittling comments to colleagues resulted in … significant personnel turnover, including in the executive ranks.”
