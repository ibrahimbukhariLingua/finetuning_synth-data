## History

The beginnings of the bank in Rwanda can be traced to 1983, when the BACAR bank was established. It became one of the first privately owned commercial banks in the country. Sometime before 2004, BACAR was taken over by the National Bank of Rwanda, the country's central bank, because of managerial issues. In 2004, Fina Bank, at that time, a Kenyan commercial bank, acquired BACAR. In 2008, Fina Bank opened banking operations in Uganda as well, forming the Fina Bank Group.

In 2013, Guaranty Trust Bank (Kenya) ltd acquired 70 percent shareholding in the Fina Bank Group for a cash payment of US$100 million. In January 2014, the bank rebranded to reflect the new ownership structure.
