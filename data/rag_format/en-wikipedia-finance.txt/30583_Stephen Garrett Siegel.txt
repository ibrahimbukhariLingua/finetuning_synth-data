In 1992, at 21, he started Prestige motors, a one-bay mechanical auto repair shop that evolved into a $2 million auto collision business and used the proceeds for other ventures. After selling Prestige Motors, Siegel utilized the proceeds to acquire a 50% stake in Uncle Howie Products, a struggling business involved in the manufacturing of children's upholstered furniture. In 2000, Siegel acquired McAlister's Collision Center from the verge of bankruptcy.
