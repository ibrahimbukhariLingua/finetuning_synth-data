**Bioverativ Inc.** is an American multinational biotechnology company that specializes in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of haemophilia. Bioverativ competes with Baxalta (acquired by Shire Plc in 2016), Pfizer and Novo Nordisk. The company traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV until Sanofi completed its acquisition on March 8, 2018.

In August, Biogen announced they would call the spun off company *Bioverativ* to show heritage with Biogen, and would be spun off in early 2017. On December 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bioverativ's registration statement, with the official separation date of the two companies being pegged at February 2017. In February, Biogen investors received a special dividend of one share of Bioverativ stock for every two shares of Biogen stock held as of January 17. Bioverativ began trading on January 12, 2017.
