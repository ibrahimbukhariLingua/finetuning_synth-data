After disappointing results, the company made several changes to its senior management with Chief Executive Giles Ballantine stepping down and the appointment of Ian Fleming as finance director, who joined from Wimpey Homes. In order to grow the business Chesterton acquired Workplace Management from ICL, British Gas Properties Facilities Management Limited from British Gas plc and became a founding partner in Exchequer Partnership plc a special purpose vehicle formed along with Bovis Ltd, Stanhope plc, Chelsfield plc and Hambros Bank to bid for the PFI contract for the refurbishment of Government Offices Great George Street, London to house HM Treasury.
**1997** The group reported a £7 million trading loss for the year, resulting in disposals of: part of the residential property management business, the plant and machinery business, withdrawal from the joint brokerage business in the US, the sale of the holding in the joint US mortgage advisory venture, the sale of the only Chestertons Residential office outside of London (in Henley-on-Thames), and the restructure of the French, Spanish and Thai businesses. Despite Exchequer Partnership plc being named as the preferred bidder, negotiations regarding refurbishing the Treasury buildings were terminated due to the financial risks to the government

**2003** Chesterton International was, after a long and colourful battle including the withdrawal of a bid from a listed company, the sacking of the Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer and a 'spoiler' bid from Manchester & Metropolitan, taken over by Phoenix Acquisitions, a vehicle of Mohammed Jafari-Fini with the company being delisted from the Stock Exchange in July 2003. As a backdrop to this, the company posted a £14.8 million pre-tax loss for the year. In the latter part of the year the company sold its Facilities Management division to Johnson Service Group and its share in Exchequer Partnerships to other partners Stanhope and Bovis Lend Lease.
**2004** Mohammad Jafari-Fini lost control of Chesterton International due to the default on a loan by Phoenix Acquisitions, and this default saw Resurge plc which lent Phoenix £12.86 million for the acquisition of Chesterton take control of the company. It later transpired, as a result of a High Court ruling in 2006, that the default was due to a payment by Jafari-Fini which was said by the court to be a bribe. Chesterton reduced losses to £4.4 million for the year.
**2005:** Chesterton International was placed into receivership by Royal Bank of Scotland. Part of the commercial arm of the company was sold to Atisreal UK (a subsidiary of BNP Paribas) which bought the commercial offices in the City of London, Southampton, Cardiff, Newcastle and Leeds.

The cost was £900,000 for the company and £3.1 million set aside for liabilities.

**2007** Arqaam, formerly CIC International, and part of the Saudi Arabian Commercial Investment Corporation sold its stake in Chesterton to Vincent Tchenquiz and Credit Mercantile Group. Chesterton Global purchased Millest & Partners (located in Sevenaoks, the firm's first branch outside London), Copping Joyce, Stickley & Kent, Moss Kaye Pemberton (marking a return for the company to commercial agency) and building surveyor Vann and Jones. During the summer of 2007 the company also expanded internationally, opening its first European office in St Tropez with offices and Gibraltar and Italy following.
**2008** The company posted its third loss in four years, this year's loss being the result of the Credit Crunch In December 2008, Mercantile purchased Vincent Tchenquiz's stake, giving it full ownership of Chesterton. Mercantile had previously bought the 34-strong chain of Humberts (founded in 1842) out of administration, along with 10 branches of its Farleys and Wellingtons chains in June of the same year for £3.16 million. The move to take full ownership of Chesterton gave it a complimentary wider ownership within the sector.
