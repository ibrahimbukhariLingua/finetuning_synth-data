# AT&T Broadband



**AT&T Broadband LLC** was an American digital cable television and telecommunications provider that served as the cable operations division of AT&T. It was founded in March 1999 when AT&T acquired the assets of TCI and renamed it to AT&T Broadband. The next year, AT&T Broadband had acquired MediaOne as well and became the largest cable operations company in the United States. In 2001, AT&T swapped the cable systems to Cable One in the San Joaquin Valley region of California, eastern Oregon, northern Utah, and southern Idaho. Later that same year, it was announced that AT&T Broadband and the Comcast Corporation will be merging their assets into "AT&T Comcast Corporation." The deal was finalized in mid-November 2002 and AT&T Broadband fully merged into Comcast Corporation.

On December 19, 2001, AT&T Broadband and Comcast Corporation announced that they would be merging as a decision was made by their respective Board of Directors. The value of the transaction was $72 billion and jointly had covered over 22 million subscribers across all United States.

In 2002, AT&T went through corporate restructuring. In the middle of November 2002, the deal was finalized and Comcast acquired AT&T Broadband under the name "Comcast Corporation".
