First Citizens' Federal Credit Union


# First Citizens' Federal Credit Union



**First Citizens' Federal Credit Union** is a federally chartered credit union headquartered in Fairhaven, Massachusetts in the AT&T Building on Mill Road.


## History

First Citizens' Federal Credit Union was originally organized as Bristol Credit Union on November 17, 1937, as a state chartered community credit union serving employees and/or residents of Bristol County, Massachusetts. The name was changed to Citizens' Credit Union during a charter expansion that extended the credit union's allowed field of membership to include the Massachusetts counties of Bristol, Plymouth, Barnstable, Dukes, Nantucket and Norfolk. In 1987, the credit union's state charter was converted to a federal charter. At the same time, the credit union deposits became federally insured. A new name was chosen, First Citizens' Federal Credit Union, which remains today.


## Locations and branches

In 1998, the seventh branch office opened for business in Falmouth. 2010 marked the opening of the Mattapoisett branch location. The credit union currently has nine branch locations and continues to grow both in size. Plans have been put into place to expand again in 2011, adding additional branches on Cape Cod. In 2011, the Mashpee branch of First Citizens opened. First Citizens' is currently a $500 million plus institution.
