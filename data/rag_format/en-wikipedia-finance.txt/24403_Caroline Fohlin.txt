## 2024 protest arrest

In April 2024, Fohlin was arrested at an Emory University protest against the treatment of Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas War. Fohlin approached a student being forced to the ground as they were arrested, leaning down to the student and yelling at the police to "get away" from them. A police officer then flipped Fohlin onto the ground and smashed her head into the concrete sidewalk before arresting her as well. Fohlin was charged with battery and disorderly conduct. An opinion piece by Lydia Polgreen for *The New York Times* cited Fohlin's arrest as an example of the "horrifying" use of force against pro-Palestine demonstrations on college campuses. On the April 29 edition of *CNN Newsroom*, anchor Jim Acosta said he could not "get over" the footage of Fohlin's arrest and criticized police for their "heavy-handed tactics."


## Personal life

Fohlin is married to John Latting, the dean of admissions at Emory University. The couple have three children.
