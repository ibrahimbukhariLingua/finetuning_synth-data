## History

Ritchies Stores were founded in 1870 by Thomas Ritchie after surviving the shipwrecked *Isabella Watson*, the first store opening up in Frankston, Victoria on what is now Nepean Highway.

In 2020, Ritchies' profits doubled over the previous year, following their promotion for consumers to choose local and neighborhood stores over supermarkets in large shopping centers during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2009 Ritchies was ranked the 20th largest Australian retailer.


## Loyalty schemes

Ritchies maintains a loyalty program, in which customers nominate a club, school or charity, and the company donates a percentage of the total spend to the customer's nominated organization each time the customer shopped within their stores. As of December 2012, Ritchies had donated over $40 million under the program.

Ritchies also offers a discount at participating BP or United service stations when transactions of over $25 are conducted in-store.
