### Allied Worldwide

On January 12, 1998, NAVL was bought out from Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:Â NSC) by the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice for more than US$200 million.

On November 21, 1999, Clayton, Dubilier and Rice also completed their acquisition of Allied Van Lines and merged it with North American Van Lines to create **Allied Worldwide**, although each former company maintained its own profile names. Valued at approximately US$450 million in the merger, the Allied Worldwide combined entity became the world's largest relocation and van line logistics company

The decade of the 2000s saw major internationalization, as the merged company reached far away from North America, beginning operations in other continents, such as Europe and South America.

In August 2020, as part of global branding strategy and continued expansion into the EMEA and APAC regions, the company unified the global brand under Allied, remaining a property of parent company SIRVA.


### SIRVA, Inc.

On February 11, 2002, Allied Worldwide was renamed as SIRVA, Inc.
