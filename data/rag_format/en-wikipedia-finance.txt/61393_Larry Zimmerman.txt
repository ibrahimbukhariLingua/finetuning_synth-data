A 31-year employee of IBM, he served as vice president of finance and planning for Brunswick Corporation's multibillion-dollar Server and Technology division from 1996 to 1998. He served as a vice chairman of Xerox Corporation from July 2009 to April 2011.

He says coming out of retirement to take over as senior vice president and CFO of Xerox Corporation in 2002 is one of the best decisions he's ever made. That's saying a lot for a financial executive with a 31-year tenure at IBM**,**. Known for his financial restructuring skills, Zimmerman helped CEO restore Xerox's reputation and guide it back to profitability after the company suffered through a messy Securities and Exchange investigation and subsequent $10 million fine.
