# Sardinian scudo



The **scudo** (plural: *scudi*) was the currency of the island Kingdom of Sardinia until 1816.


## History

It was subdivided into 2½ *lire* (singular: *lira*), each of 4 *reales*, 20 *soldi*, 120 *cagliarese* or 240 *denari*. The *doppietta* was worth 2 scudi. It was replaced by the Sardinian lira.


## Coins

In the late 18th century, coins circulated in denominations of 1 and 3 cagliarese, 1 soldo, ½ and 1 reale, ¼, ½ and 1 scudo, 1, 2½ and 5 doppietta. The cagliarese denominations were struck in copper, the soldo and reale in billon, the scudo in silver and the doppietta in gold.
