Additional funds needed


# Additional funds needed



**Additional funds needed** (AFN) is a financial concept used when a business looks to expand its operations. Since a business that seeks to increase its sales level will require more assets to meet that goal, some provision must be made to accommodate the change in assets. To phrase it another way, the business must have some plan to actually finance the new assets that will be needed to increase sales.


## Calculation

AFN is a way of calculating how much new funding will be required, so that the firm can realistically look at whether or not they will be able to generate the additional funding and therefore be able to achieve the higher sales level. Determining the amount of external funding needed is a key part of calculating AFN.

A simplified version of the AFN equation is as follows:

> `AFN = Projected increase in assets – spontaneous increase in liabilities – any increase in retained earnings`

When calculating AFN, consideration must be given to whether the company is already operating at full capacity; if not, they can expand sales some without having to invest in new equipment.

If the AFN (Additional Funds Needed) value comes out to be negative, this is actually a positive situation for the company! A negative AFN means that the company will not need external financing to support its growth. It indicates that the company has enough internal funds to support its projected sales growth.

The AFN equation is as follows:

AFN = (A0/S0)ΔS-(L0/S0)ΔS-MS₁(1-Payout)

Where:

A₀ (Current Assets): Represents the company's current assets, including cash, inventory, and equipment.

S₀ (Current Sales): The company's current sales or revenue figures, showing the base sales level.

ΔS (Change in Sales): The projected increase in sales, forecasting future growth.

L₀ (Spontaneous Liabilities): Liabilities that increase automatically with sales growth, like accounts payable and accrued wages.

M (Profit Margin): The company's net income divided by sales, showing profitability.

S₁ (New Level of Sales): The projected sales level after the expected growth.

Payout Ratio: The percentage of earnings distributed as dividends, with the rest reinvested in the company.

In Finance knowing calculation is not enough it's great if you understand the whole AFN equation with a business case scenario.

The relevant ratios within the formula are:

(A\*/S₀): Called the capital intensity ratio

(L\*/S₀): Called the spontaneous liabilities ratio
