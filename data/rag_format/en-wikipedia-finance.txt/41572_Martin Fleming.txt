## Breakthrough: A Growth Revolution (book)

Fleming is the author of *Breakthrough: A Growth Revolution*was published in October 2022 by Business Expert Press. In the book, Fleming applies a unique approach that combines deep analysis of current economic and societal trends with a rich history of the four major industrial revolutions.

Fleming argues that conditions are ripe for a post-pandemic global growth revolution – if government leaders, business executives and workers come together to adopt a proposed “Growth and Fairness Agenda” designed to break five decades of stagnating real wages, limited GDP and productivity growth, and declines in labor’s income share.

According to Susan Lund, vice president, economics and private sector development, International Finance Corporation, World Bank Group, “Fleming has written an engaging and important book that identifies actionable pathways for inclusive growth in the post-pandemic recovery.”

Stuart P.M. Mackintosh, executive director, Group of Thirty, said: “{*Breakthrough*} is an outstanding book, laying out the dynamics of the ongoing AI-industrial revolution. It deserves a reading by a wide audience of economists, policymakers, analysts, and students across disciplines.”

Diane Swonk, Chief Economist for KPMG, summarized *Breakthrough*: "Fleming lays out a road map for hope. He sees the potential a way to overcome some of our largest economic hurdles."

Fleming will present key findings from *Breakthrough* at a series of conferences and events in autumn 2022, including the MIT Computational Foundations of Prosperity, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) Annual Meeting, the World KLEMS Conference, the NABE Tech Economics conference, and the annual Conference of Business Economists Meeting.
