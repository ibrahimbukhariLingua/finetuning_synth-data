## Three Dimensional Business Definition model

The Three Dimensional Business Definition model (or Abell model) helps a company define its business. Prior to Abell’s model, it was common to define a business either through its resource capabilities or its programs of activity, such as with a product/market grid. According to his book, Defining the Business, Abell suggests the previous two-dimensional definitions were insufficient, and instead created a three-dimensional analysis. The three dimensions in Abell's model are:

* Served Customer Groups (who are the customers)
* Served Customer Functions (what are the customers' needs)
* Technologies Utilized (how are needs being satisfied)
