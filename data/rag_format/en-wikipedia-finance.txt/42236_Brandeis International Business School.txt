## History

Brandeis University, the parent institution of Brandeis International Business School, was founded in 1948. Brandeis International Business School was first established as the Graduate School of International Economics and Finance (GSIEF), reflecting increased student enrollment in economics and finance courses, and the creation of the PhD in International Economics and Finance in 1994. In 1998, the MBA and Master of Science in Finance (MSF) programs were added, broadening the scope of the school's teaching and research.

The school was renamed Brandeis International Business School in 2003 to reflect this broader expertise and the increasing focus on international and global business. In 2010, Brandeis University introduced a business major and minor, through which undergraduates are able to take graduate classes in management and international finance at Brandeis International Business School. In 2017, the school introduced an Accelerated Master's program in economics and finance.
