## History


### Foundation and early years

The beginning of the Kerala State Co-operative Bank Ltd dates back to early 20th century. In 1914, the then Maharaja of Travancore, His Highness Sree Moolam Thirunal Ramavarma, through a proclamation introduced "The Travancore Co-operative Societies Regulation Act". The Bank was registered in the year 1915 as the "Trivandrum Central Co-operative Bank" which was the first Co-operative Society to be formed in the former princely State of Travancore. It started functioning as a Bank on 18 January 1916 with a share capital of ₹1,00,000 made up of 1000 shares of ₹100 each. In the beginning there were 16 Co-operative Societies and 69 individuals as its members.


### Converted in 1943

In 1943, it was converted into the Travancore Central Co-operative Bank, giving it a federal character of the Travancore State. In the wake of Indian Independence and the reorganization of States, the Bank was re-organized as a State Co-operative Bank for Travancore-Cochin State in the year 1954. In the year 1956, the reorganization of Indian States took place. The State of Kerala was formed on 1 November 1956. The Bank was then elevated to the position of State Co-operative Bank for the State of Kerala and it became "The Kerala State Co-operative Bank Ltd." At that time, the Bank had a working capital of ₹42.90 lakhs, deposit of ₹30.33 lakhs and loans and advances to the tune of ₹21.66 lakhs.

The Kerala State Co-operative Bank was registered and retained as an Apex Bank in which only the Co-operative Banks approved by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies were admitted as members. Since then, the Trivandrum District Co-operative Bank and the Government of Kerala were the only members. Subsequently after the formation of the Districts, District Co-operative Banks were registered in each District and all the District Co-operative Banks were admitted as members.


### Becoming a scheduled state bank

In July 1966, the Kerala State Co-operative Bank Ltd was included in the 2nd Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934. As per the provisions contained in the 2nd Schedule of the Act, gradually approved the Bank as a Scheduled State Co-operative Bank. The Kerala State Co-operative Bank Ltd is the first Scheduled Apex Co-operative Bank in the Co-operative Banking Sector in the country. In 1972, it was issued a license to carry on the business of Banking under Section 22 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1966. This Bank is a financing bank as defined in the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969 and is a Co-operative Society which has only other Co-operative Societies as its members. The bank is engaged in banking business within the frame work of rules/regulations/guidelines stipulated by Reserve Bank of India and National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD).


### Merger of district banks

The Government of Kerala had taken a policy decision to convert the existing three tier short term co-operative structure within the State into a two tier structure. The Reserve Bank of India had conveyed their consent for the amalgamation of 13 District Co-operative Banks which approved scheme of amalgamation with Kerala State Co-operative Bank. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies has approved the resolution passed by 13 District Co-operative Banks on 3 July 2019 to transfer its assets and liabilities in whole to Kerala State Co-operative Bank and issued order for amalgamation of 13 District Co-operative Bank with Kerala state Co-operative Bank, based on the resolutions passed by General Bodies of respective District Co-operative Banks as provided under section 14A of Kerala Co-operative Societies Act.

Among the 14 District Co-operative Banks functioning in Kerala at the time of the formation of Kerala State Co-operative Bank, only the Malappuram District Co-operative Bank Ltd had opposed merger with the Kerala State Co-operative Bank. Also, the High Court of Kerala has issued a stay order on the Kerala State Government's move to merge the Malappuram District Co-operative Bank with the Kerala State Co-operative Bank.
