Stolberg thaler


# Stolberg thaler



The North German thaler was the currency issued by the County of Stolberg, and after multiple divisions, by its successors Stolberg-Stolberg, Stolberg-Rossla, Stolberg-Wernigerode, Stolberg-Königstein, and Stolberg-Rochefort counties. It was issued from the late 15th century until mid 18th century when Stolberg-Wernigerode was forced to subordinate themselves to the Kingdom of Prussia and the counts of Stolberg-Stolberg and Stolberg-Rossla to the Electorate of Saxony. Numerous coinage issued by Stolberg counties was made possible by rich silver mines in their possessions.

The Stolberg thaler was distinctive in its design, featuring the coat of arms of Stolberg on one side and stag facing left, often in front of a column, on the other. The coin was minted from high-quality silver and was considered to be of good weight and fineness.
