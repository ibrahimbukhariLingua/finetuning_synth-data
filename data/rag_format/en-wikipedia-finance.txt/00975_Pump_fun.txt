# Pump.fun



**pump.fun** (commonly referred to as **Pump**) is a cryptocurrency launchpad for the Solana blockchain that enables users to create tokens and trade them immediately on the platform, as well as to launch them onto decentralized exchanges, a process known as "graduation". The platform was launched on January 19, 2024, by Noah Tweedale, Alon Cohen and Dylan Kerler While any type of token can be created, the majority of tokens are classified as meme coins due to their lack of functionality outside of investments. It has been described as the "ground zero" for launching meme coins. As of January 2025, over 6 million meme coins had been launched on the platform according to *Wired*.

The platform has been compared with social media platforms such as 4chan, as all accounts are identified either with their Solana wallet address or a nickname, as well as token listings being laid out similarly to an imageboard's catalog feature.


## History

The domain name was first registered on September 19, 2023, with the platform launching four months later on January 19, 2024. The website was started by an anonymous developer known as Alon, tweeting that he wanted to make it "the most fun place on the internet". It was later revealed from public documents associated with the website that the owners were a trio of English entrepreneurs named Noah Tweedale, Alon Cohen and Dylan Kerler, who say they started the site due to their frustrations with trading memecoins and the risks of getting rug pulled. The site allows instant creation of memecoins by uploading an image along with picking a ticker and a name for less than $2 in fees. According to *Bloomberg*, "new tokens on Pump.fun are created through a so-called fair launch method, where all tokens are minted at once without presales, often at a fraction of a cent." Pump.fun was estimated to have generated $60 million in transaction fees in the first half of 2024, with over a million tokens having been created by July 2024.

The site launched a livestreaming feature in 2024 that allowed token developers to advertise their tokens to other users. Livestreams were used as a marketing tool for newly released tokens to stand out on the platform, as the constant influx of token creations on the platform can quickly make new coins become irrelevant. The feature became controversial not long after release, as a number of token creators began to partake in increasingly extreme actions to attract potential investors to their product, prompting the platform to indefinitely disable the feature after major community backlash and attention from financial news organizations. Some streamers claimed to be live from within U.S. prisons, ran live sex shows or played games of Russian roulette. One streamer threatened to waterboard another person.

In November 2024, "Gen Z Quant", a token made on the platform by a 13-year-old who publicized it through pump.fun's streaming service before dumping his holdings onto the market (roughly 5 percent of the total supply of the token) and abandoning the token after reaching a $1 million market cap, earning $50,000. This angered many of the platform's users, prompting the community to pump the token in revenge to an US$85 million market cap, as well as to dox the creator's name, home address and school.

The livestream functionality was suspended in November 2024 following heavy criticism with the site's staff stating that it would be removed "for an indefinite time period until the moderation infrastructure is ready to deal with the heightened levels of activity". The removal of the livestream feature caused a sharp decline in platform activity, with the amount of tokens being created dropping by 50 percent, and active users falling by 69 percent by the end of November 2024. The site's revenues also fell below $2 million for the first time in weeks.

In January 2025, a lawsuit against pump.fun was filed in the Southern District of New York by an investor who lost money buying the token PNUT. The lawsuit claims that pump.fun operated as an unregistered securities exchange and put investors at a high financial risk.
