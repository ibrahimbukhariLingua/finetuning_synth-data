## U.S. laws providing grants and subsidies

A number of laws of the United States providing for real estate grants or subsidies extend coverage to Puerto Rico:

* Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937
* Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1961
* Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972
* Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937

## Regulations

Act 77 of 1964 regulates the business of real estate for companies headquartered inside Puerto Rico, while Act 45 of 1980 regulates those outside of Puerto Rico.


### Access control

Law No. 21 of 20 May 1987, amended principally by Law No. 156 of 10 August 1988 and Law No. 22 of 16 July 1992. (23 L.P.R.A., Secs. 64 et seq.); Regulation No. 3843 of Traffic Control and public use of local streets.

In 1987, the Legislature approved Law No. 21 of 20 May to authorize developments and communities to control vehicular access for cars and public use of their residential streets, with the main purpose of providing citizens an additional tool for fighting crime and thus ensure their active cooperation in the fight against crime. The law also aims to improve the security and tranquility of communities so that residents can achieve healthy living and community interaction. The concept of Access Control implies that the public nature of residential streets is preserved, while residents are allowed to establish means for controlling vehicular traffic and public use, and thus ensure their own safety and cultivate an environment conducive to better living.


### CRIM

The Municipal Revenues Collection Center (CRIM in Spanish) was created in August 1991 as part of a municipal reform with the primary objective of increasing the powers and economic capacities of Puerto Rico's municipalities.

### Zoning

The zoning purpose of empowering market growth and urban development is a governmental power established under Executive order in conjunction with the Legislative and Judicial branches of Puerto Rico. Both the Puerto Rico Planning Board *(Junta de Planificación de Puerto Rico)* and Rules and Permits Administration *(Administración de Reglamentos y Permisos - ARPE)* act as two random variable agencies independent from each other to keep balances in check and delegate economic planning, land use zoning, and case-by-case permitting in Puerto Rico. Since the late 1900s, major townships have been taking over that role under their own jurisdiction; there is no compensation for any restrictions or limitations that zoning imposes on properties. The Puerto Rico Planning Board was created on May 12, 1942 during Rexford Tugwell's administration under Law No. 213 which converged centralized governmental planning with a New Deal philosophy under one American flag. It was later reorganized by Law No. 75 of June 24, 1975.


## Significant developments


### Transfer of properties to municipalities

On June 29, 2010, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed a bill transferring thirty (30) installations to municipalities including postmodern art space, an emphasis on security, and Head Start centers with contemporary health amenities. According to Luis Fortuño, the municipalities receiving the properties were Barceloneta, Caguas, Cidra, Comerío, Guayama, Gurabo, Humacao, Juncos, Lajas, Lares, Morovis, Naguabo, Peñuelas, Ponce, Salinas, San Lorenzo, San Sebastián, Yabucoa and Yauco. He also transferred the administration of the Yabucoa Diagnostic and Treatment Center to that municipality. According to the new law, the municipal authority should cede its jurisdiction, in case of jurisdictional conflict, to the state authority in order to limit the violations of municipal laws from police action.


### Housing stimulus program, 2011

During the month of August 2010, Luis Fortuño implemented a real estate / market plan **(HS 2011)** to reduce a large inventory of 20,000 unsold new homes.
