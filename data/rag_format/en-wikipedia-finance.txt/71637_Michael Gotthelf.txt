## Foundations

As chairman of the Ludwig-Börne-Stiftung, Gotthelf was one of the initiators of the Ludwig-Börne-Preis, a literary award for essays, reviews and reportage founded in 1993. Germany’s President Joachim Gauck and the literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki have been awarded this prize among others.

At the beginning of 2008 Gotthelf founded the Walther Rathenau Institut, a foundation for international policy based in Berlin. He serves as the Chairman of the advisory Board of this foundation. In remembrance of the German foreign policymaker Walther Rathenau the institute supports political education and annually awards the Walther-Rathenau-Preis standing for human rights and tolerance. Hillary Clinton, for instance, received the prize due to her efforts for the peace in crisis regions.

In 2014/15 Gotthelf, together with Mathias Döpfner and Martin Meyer among others, founded the "Frank-Schirrmacher-Stiftung" following the surprising death of his friend Schirrmacher in June 2014. Schirrmacher was one of the leading German intellectuals and editor in chief of the cultural section of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung". The prize money of 20,000 Swiss Francs for the
annual Schirrmacher award which honours work to further the understanding of current affairs, was received by Hans Magnus Enzensberger in 2015, followed by Michel Houellebecq, Jonathan Franzen, Daniel Kehlmann and Peter Thiel.
