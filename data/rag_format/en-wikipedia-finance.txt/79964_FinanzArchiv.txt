## Overview

FinanzArchiv was first published in 1884, which makes it one of the world's oldest professional journals in economics. In 2006 the traditional title was complemented by the English sub-title Public Finance Analysis.

Its founder and first editor from 1884 to 1931 was Georg von Schanz, the inventor of the Schanz-Haig-Simons concept of comprehensive income. The list of subsequent editors includes Hans Teschemacher, Fritz Neumark, Norbert Andel, Helga Pollak, Wolfgang Wiegard, Wolfram F. Richter, Hans-Werner Sinn, James R. Hines, Peter Birch Sørensen, Bernd Genser, Harry Huizinga, Jenny Ligthart, and Christian Keuschnigg.

The current editors of FinanzArchiv are Katherine Cuff, McMaster University, Ronnie Schöb, Freie Universität Berlin, and Alfons J. Weichenrieder (managing editor), Goethe University Frankfurt.

The journal is well-established in public economics and keeps close relations to the International Institute of Public Finance (IIPF). 26 to 30 original scientific papers from various fields in public economics are published each year to serve the international readers. Manuscripts must be in English and are accepted for publication subject to a peer-review process. Online submission is required.
