The conference explored the 'digital revolution' within advertising and how advertising may work in the future. The event was attended by over 100 senior advertising professionals and led to a special edition of the Journal of Advertising Research which was released in June 2009. The Institute is collaborating with The Wharton School's 'Future of Advertising' project and the Advertising Research Foundation in 2012 for a follow-up to the 2008 conference which will feature research on multi-media orchestrated advertising.
