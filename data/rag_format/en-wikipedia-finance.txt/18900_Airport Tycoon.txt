Airport Tycoon


# Airport Tycoon



***Airport Tycoon*** is a business simulation game released for Windows 95/98 in 2000. It was developed in the United Kingdom by Krisalis Software (now defunct). In *Airport Tycoon*, the player must successfully build and manage an airport without going bankrupt. There have been two sequels created for *Airport Tycoon*: *Airport Tycoon 2* and *Airport Tycoon 3*. There was to be a Nintendo 64 version released as well, but this version was cancelled for unknown reasons.


## History

*Airport Tycoon* was originally called *Airport Inc.* and *Air Mogul*. A week before the game's publishing, Krisalis Software changed its name to *Airport Tycoon* in some markets, a more catchy title, but the game calls itself *Air Mogul* because of the inadequate time to change the software, and is sold in PAL as *Airport Inc.* Krisalis became defunct shortly after publishing *Airport Tycoon*.


## Gameplay

Similar to other games of this type, players take on the role of an airport manager. They first select a location for their airport from several cities around the world. Players then construct a terminal for their passengers, followed by runways, tarmac, control towers and support services.

The player then attracts business to their airport by signing contracts with vendors in the terminal and contracting flights into and out of the airport. Players also manage the airport's budget, which cannot operate at too much of a loss. Players can operate passenger airports and cargo airports with different considerations for each.

A number of preset scenarios are also available to the player, including the conversion of a major cargo airport to a passenger airport in Beijing.


## Development

Telstar secured worldwide publishing rights to the game in May 1998.
