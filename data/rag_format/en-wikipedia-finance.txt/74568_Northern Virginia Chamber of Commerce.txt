# Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce



The **Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce** is a membership based business network located in Fairfax County, Virginia. It represents 650+ businesses and 500,000 employees, making it the largest regional chamber of commerce in Virginia.

The chamber provides the Northern Virginia business community with access to opportunities represented by the Chamberâ€™s four foundational pillars: business development, thought leadership, strategic advocacy, and community partnerships.

In January 2016, the organization restructured itself from the **Fairfax Chamber of Commerce** to the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. In August 2018, the Chamber announced that Better Business Bureau Chief Operating Officer, Julie Coons, would be the organization's new President and CEO following a nation-wide search.
