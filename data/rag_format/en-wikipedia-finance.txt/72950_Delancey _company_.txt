**Delancey Real Estate Asset Management Limited** is a British property development company that has wholly owned subsidiaries such as DV4 based in offshore jurisdictions.

In 2011, the Qatari ruling family bought the Olympic Village used in the London 2012 Olympic Games. The area has been renamed the East Village.


## History

The firm was founded by Jamie Ritblat, son of Sir John Ritblat, after he left British Land in 1995. In 2000, The Guardian reported that Delancey Estates, then a quoted George Soros-backed commercial real estate company, could take itself private. The first major office investment was reported to be 6 Chesterfield Gardens, London W1 for £30m in 2003 and Soros's Morston Nominees was said to be the largest shareholder in Delancey's old Tribeca fund.

It was formerly quoted, but in 2001 went private again after a share buyback.

The billionaire George Soros is an investor in British Land and Delancey. In 1994, G Soros Realty Investors, acquired £1.34 million British Land shares at 298p from a Quantum Fund holding. British Land did not disclose this, but did reveal that John Ritblat received 2 million shares at cost from the Quantum Fund. When the deal was disclosed in June 1993, Mr Ritblat's share issuance was defended as being an incentive for British Land to perform. An early deal for Soros and Ritblat was for the Broadgate complex in the City of London in 1994. Sir John Ritblat acquired British Land from Jim Slater in 1970 for £1m, and retired as chairman in 2006.

In 2005, Soros embarked on a £2bn London property spree through his investments Delancey which was selling off commercial real estate and also sold its stake in Mapeley, the off-shore company that owned and managed Inland Revenue offices. George Soros was also investing in other companies including a big stake in one of China's largest airlines. The National Audit Office and Parliamentarians were highly critical of the Inland Revenue's decision to sell over 600 buildings to a Bermuda-based company and misleading the public. Revenue chairman Sir Nicholas Montagu later admitted his organisation wrongly announced the properties were sold to a UK firm. There was further public concern in 2020 when a £6.5m Government payment was made to a company in a tax haven.
