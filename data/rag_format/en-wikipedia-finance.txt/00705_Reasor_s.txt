## Store departments and services

Reasor's offers services typical of large grocery stores: meat and deli products, fresh produce, dairy and cheese products, canned goods, etc. Most locations offer an ATM and Pharmacy. Recently, Reasor's has begun the service of allowing customers to shop for groceries online (begun at its Tahlequah store).


## Founding and company history

Reasor's was founded in 1963 with a single store located in Tahlequah by Larry Reasor. His fundamental business philosophy was to "sell the customers items they want to buy."

Reasor's past CEO was Jeff Reasor (Larry Reasor's son); he has stated that it is his desire to continue operating the company using his father's vision. He has also stated that "customer service" and "putting customers needs first" continue to be the primary business philosophy of Reasor's. Brookshire Grocery Company is carrying on that tradition today, while investing into the stores and partners.


## Acquisition by Brookshire Grocery Company

In November 2021 Brookshire's announced their acquisition of all 17 Reasor's locations, to be finalized in 2022.
