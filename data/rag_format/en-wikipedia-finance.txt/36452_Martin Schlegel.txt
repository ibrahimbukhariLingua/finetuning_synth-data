In the years 2015 and 2016 Schlegel also worked as an expert for the International Monetary Fund.

After a proposal from the SNB's Bank Council, Schlegel was appointed as an Alternate member of the SNB's Governing Board by the Swiss Federal Council in June 2018. In May 2022, the Federal Council appointed Schlegel as the Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank. This also made him Head of Department II of the SNB.

In an interview in October 2023 Schlegel, talking about the Acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, said: "We don't have a mandate to rescue a bank."

After the announcement of Thomas Jordans resignation in March 2024, Schlegel was seen as the favourite for his position as Chairman of the SNB. On 26 June 2024 the Federal Council elected Schlegel as the new Chairman following the recommendation of the Governing Board. He assumed the position on 1 October 2024.


## Personal life

Schlegel is married to Nicole Br√§ndle, who's the current director of HotellerieSuisse, but will step down in June 2025 to avoid giving the impression of a conflict of interest with Schlegels promotion to director. They have 3 children together.
