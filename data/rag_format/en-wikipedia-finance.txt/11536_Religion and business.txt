## Religion in business

**India**
Government and private businesses in north and south India often do a Hindu ritual in which a priest comes to the premises, typically every week, and performs a ritual called Puja. The ritual is performed by doing an Aarti which is done by lighting a piece of camphor on a small metal holder or a lighting a thick thread soaked in small metal container which contains sesame or coconut oil for a few minutes and swinging it around pictures or idols of Hindu gods or goddesses present in the premises. Many small to medium public and private companies in India also have pictures, icons or small statues of Hindu gods and goddesses at their premises which are often worshiped by lighting incense sticks and putting them before those pictures or idols. Visiting priests also may perform a puja ritual by doing an Aarti before those pictures or idols or they may light incense sticks and swing these and put them before those pictures or idols. Individual flowers or a garland of flowers are also used for decoration of idols or pictures. The puja ritual is also done for items such as business purchases in government and private industries. These religious rituals take place regularly at government and private offices in north and south India. People in north and south India also exhibit religious symbols in businesses such as putting a Tilaka on their forehead which implies that they are involved with Hindu religion and believe that it brings them success in their day-to-day activities. Hindu Women in workplaces typically wear bindi on their forehead and if they are married, they would wear a necklace called Mangala sutra around their neck. They may sometimes wear kumkum on their hair and turmeric on their feet. Some Indian men and women wear rings or necklaces with talismans containing pictures or idols of Hindu gods and goddesses. The rings worn above may contain symbols of Hindu religion or precious stones as talismans. Men wear tight black or red or orange threads on the wrist of their right hand as they believe that such threads have some divine influence which works in their favour. Men who are Sikhs wear a turban on their head. Men in Sikh religion also wear a thick metal bangle called Kara on their right hand between their wrist and elbow.

It is not uncommon for people in India to bring up topics in religions at workplaces. Since there are no national or state laws in India to forbid religions in workplaces, people are generally comfortable in adapting their workplaces to religious themes or topics.

Groff eventually resigned and sued the USPS. In a case considering whether to overrule the *Trans World Airlines* case aforementioned, the Supreme Court chose not to overrule the case but sided with Groff in clarifying that the "undue hardship" standard imposed in Title VII does not equate to "*de minimis*" and instead stated that a business must show "a more than de minimis cost".


### 2023 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis (6–3)

Similar to the *Masterpiece Cakeshop* case, this case concerned whether discrimination laws can compel people to provide work that violates their religious beliefs and values. 303 Creative LLC filed a pre-enforcement challenge against the same Colorado anti-discrimination laws that were challenged in the *Masterpiece Cakeshop* case. After much litigation, the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that the public-accommodation law is unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, stating that the law violated the petitioner's right to free speech.
