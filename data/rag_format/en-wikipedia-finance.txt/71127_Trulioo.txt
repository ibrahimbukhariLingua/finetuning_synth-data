**Trulioo** is a Canadian-based company that provides electronic identity and address verification of both individuals and businesses. Trulioo customers use the service to verify the identity of their own customers as part of 'Know Your Customer' verification. It began as a service to Facebook in 2012, and as of 2014 includes verification for Google and LinkedIn.


## History

Trulioo was founded by Stephen Ufford and Tanis Jorge. Both previously worked together on three startups in the consumer credit industry, with Ufford as CEO and Jorge as COO of Pharos Global Strategies. They also held similar positions with iQuiri.com and NCB Data, both of which were sold to FreeCreditReport.com and Experian respectively.

In February 2022 Trulioo acquired HelloFlow, a Danish firm.

In June 2022, Trulioo released upgrades to their flagship identity verification platform, including AML Watchlist Screening and Business Verification services. New to the platform is a proof-of-address service via utility providers.
