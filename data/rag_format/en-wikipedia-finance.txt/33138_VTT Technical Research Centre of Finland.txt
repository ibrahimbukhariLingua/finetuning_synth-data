## History


### Technical Research Institute of Finland (VTL) (1942–1972)

VTT – then called the Technical Research Institute of Finland (VTL) – was founded on 16 January 1942 by President Risto Ryti’s decree. Its mission was to engage in technical research for the benefit of science and society as a whole. Construction started immediately, and the research institute was completed in autumn 1943. The volume of the building was 20,000 cubic metres, and seven of VTT’s first ten laboratories were placed in the building. After the war, VTT expanded rapidly and was particularly occupied with the quality assurance of war compensation products.

In 1950, the research institute comprised 15 laboratories. The state bought the land of Otaniemi Manor in 1949, and in 1955 the laboratory of mining technology moved to Otaniemi as the first VTT laboratory.

In the 1960s, VTT grew to be the largest research institute in Finland, employing more than 400 people. VTT was an internationally recognised research centre.

In the 1970s, the research institute underwent extensive modernisation, such as simplifying the administration and expanding the testing activities to research.


### Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) (1972–2009)

In March 1972, the Technical Research Institute of Finland changed its name to Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT, *Valtion teknillinen tutkimuskeskus*, National Technical Research Centre). VTT received new tasks due to the strong growth and diversification of industrial activities. It also participated in research related to the restructuring of society. The activities focused on technology research and the associated development work.

In 1990, VTT had almost 6,000 cubic metres of underground laboratory space in Otaniemi and 15,000 square metres excavated at a depth exceeding 20 metres.

In June 2007, the Ministerial Working Group on Administration and Regional Development supported the proposal of the Ministry of Industry and Trade to launch the preparatory work for transforming VTT into a state enterprise in early 2009.


### VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland (2010–2014)

A new name was introduced in 2010: VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. VTT was divided structurally into groups. In addition to the parent company VTT, the new VTT Group consisted of three subsidiaries: VTT Expert Services Ltd, VTT Ventures Ltd and VTT International Ltd. VTT Memsfab Ltd started its operations in 2011.

In 2012, VTT had more than 3,000 employees.

In January 2014, VTT reformed its organisation and divided its operations into three business areas:

* Knowledge Intensive Products and Services,
* Smart Industry and Energy Systems; and
* Solutions for Natural Resources and the Environment.

In May 2014, the Government proposed that VTT would be made a limited liability company and that Mikes and VTT would be merged. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, VTT operated in a very businesslike manner: it received about 70 per cent of its income from commissions assigned by companies and research funding open to competition.


### VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd (2015–)

In January 2015, the Centre for Metrology (MIKES) was merged with VTT, and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland became a limited liability company. The company’s field of activity was defined as applied research in technology, taking research results to practical use, and operating as a national metrology institute. As a limited liability company, VTT was able to react more easily to changes in the customers and the environment, and to operate more freely in the financial markets. Bioruukki, a research centre for the bioeconomy and circular economy, was established in Kivenlahti, Espoo. Its aim was to overcome the ‘valley of death’ associated with the commercialisation of inventions.

In January 2018, VTT sold Labtium Ltd and VTT Expert Services Ltd, which provided testing, inspection and certification services, to Eurofins Scientific Group. In May, it was announced that VTT would start coordinating a European consortium of more than 10 million euros to develop commercial applications for high-temperature SOFC fuel cell technology.

In 2019, VTT launched its own incubator activities, VTT Launchpad, through which it provided support for research teams in setting up businesses. In December, VTT established a unit focusing on autonomous mobility in Turku, VTT Senseway.

In May 2020, VTT announced that it would acquire Finland’s first quantum computer. Its aim was to build a 50-qubit quantum computer. The Finnish IQM Finland Oy, which works with quantum computing, was selected as the supplier of the quantum computer.

On 30 October 2024, it was reported that VTT was selected as the first-ever foreign partner to join an ARPA-E research program funded by the United States Department of Energy. In the program VTT, together with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, aim to accelerate the commercial use of fusion energy. The collaboration focuses on solving the challenges of materials needed in extreme conditions.


## Organization

VTT’s head office is located in Otaniemi, Espoo. The President and CEO is Antti Vasara, DSc (Tech.). In addition to Espoo, VTT has offices in Jyväskylä, Kajaani, Kuopio, Tampere and Oulu.

In 2022, VTT has four subsidiaries:

* VTT Ventures Ltd
* VTT International Ltd
* VTT SenseWay Oy
* VTT Holding Oy

VTT also has five key initiatives, which it calls the technologies of exponential hope and growth

* biotechnology in food production,
* quantum technology,
* optimising the use of material,
* small nuclear reactors and
* chemical plastics recycling

## VTT’s activities and impact

VTT receives research funding from the state to perform its basic task, but the state-funded research activities are separated from the company’s market-based activities.
