The Mayfair Set


# The Mayfair Set



***The Mayfair Set***, subtitled ***Four Stories about the Rise of Business and the Decline of Political Power***, is a BBC television documentary series by filmmaker Adam Curtis. It explores the decline of Britain as a world power, the proliferation of asset stripping in the 1970s, and how buccaneer capitalists helped to shape the climate of the Thatcher years, by focusing on Colonel David Stirling, Jim Slater, Sir James Goldsmith and Tiny Rowland—members of London's elite Clermont Club in the 1960s. It won a BAFTA Award for Best Factual Series or Strand in 2000.

Curtis wanted to engage with the moral ambiguity of figures such as Goldsmith.
