# Entertainment tax



**Entertainment tax** also sometimes referred to as "amusement tax" is any tax levied on any form of commercial entertainment, such as movie tickets, exhibitions, sport events and more. The specific rules such as the tax rate of entertainment tax and cases of tax exemption are subject to local authorities, as is their collection. The entertainment tax has in the most cases the form of indirect tax, which is levied on buyer. Nowadays, the most discussed subject of those taxes are their implementations to online services, especially the ones working on streaming basis such as Netflix, Spotify and others.

In India, Entertainment Tax is a tax imposed by the government on feature films getting a wide release in the country and are reduced from gross collections, major commercial shows and big private festivals. The amount after deducting entertainment tax is known as net.

In Delhi, movie tickets, large commercial shows and large private festival celebrations may incur an entertainment tax.

Entertainment falls in List 2 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and is exclusively reserved as a revenue source for the state governments. Historically, before India acquired independence, British government imposed heavy taxes on the events of amusements and entertainment, where a large gathering of Indians could have caused rebellion or mutiny. Thus, various entertainment tax acts of the state governments permit the rate of tax beyondᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ 100%. After independence, old enactments continued and there has been no revision or repeal of these acts.

This source of revenue has grown with the advent of pay television services in India. Since, entertainment is being provided through the services such as broadcasting services, DTH Services, Pay TV Services, cable services, etc. The component of entertainment is intrinsically intertwined in the transaction of service, that it can not be separated from the whole transaction. Given the nature of transaction of service, it is being subjected to tax by the Union and the State governments both.

The fiscal principle underlying article 246 of the constitution of India separates the sources of taxation for the Union and the States and also maintains the exclusivity. This article also provides that in case of conflict between the powers of Union and the States, the Union power to tax shall supersede the power of the State to levy tax on the taxable event or in relation to the subject or object of taxation. Entertainment tax structure in India varies across states and is the highest in Uttar Pradesh at 60 per cent. In Maharashtra, entertainment tax was reduced by five per cent in 2005 and now stands at 45 per cent. There is no tax for Marathi films in Maharashtra, and in Tamil Nadu, Tamil films are tax free if they have a Tamil title and a U certificate from the Censor Board. Failing any of these, films are imposed a 15% tax.

The entertainment industry in India is facing the challenge of double taxation on such transactions.

## Chicago

In Chicago, the entertainment tax is known as the amusement tax. Nowadays, the amusement tax is levied on cultural events (performances, exhibitions, etc.), commercial events (promotional shows, presentations), sport events of any kind (car races, tennis, horse-races, etc.), entertainment activities for public participation or attended based on paid membership (sport clubs, etc.) and virtually provided amusement services (paid television programmes, etc.) based on streaming basis. The general exemptions are events with religious purposes, events to support the veterans and generally all non-profiting events. The City of Chicago offers at their online site templates for amusement providers to be filled as well as complete guide regarding the amusement tax and the liabilities.


### Amendments

The amusement tax in Chicago has been in effect since 17 February 1986 and has gone through several amendments. It is assigned to section 4-156 in Chicago municipal code. In 1999 the tax rate for middle-sized (750-5,000 people) events was reduced to 3%. Although, the first major amendment was in July 2004 where the original concept was enlarged by above mentioned paid television programmes and paid membership activities. The largest and nowadays most discussed amendment came into effect on 1 July 2015. It introduced a general 9% tax rate with exception for registered reseller for whom the rate is 3% and since 2018 the rate was decreased to 5% for cultural performances which are held in auditoriums with maximum capacity exceeding 750 persons. This rule was changed later that year and now there is total exemption from the tax if the event is live performance and the capacity is less than 1,500 persons. However, the controversy part of this amendment was including the digital streaming and online entertainment platforms as well (Netflix, Spotify, etc.), this expansion is often referred to as "Netflix tax" or "Cloud tax". However, this affects only temporary services, e.g. the music tracks, movies, games and other online goods bought online and downloaded permanently are not subject to this tax (it is subject to digital sales tax, which in the state of Illinois is equal to 6.25%).


### Controversy

The new enlargement for "Netflix tax" was predicted to bring $12 million to the treasury of the city and help to decrease the city's budget deficit which was in 2016 around $500 million. However, the new amusement tax is subject to widespread criticism because of alleged violations of other federal laws, state laws and precedent of the Supreme Court.
