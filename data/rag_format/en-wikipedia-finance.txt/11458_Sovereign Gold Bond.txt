Sovereign Gold Bond


# Sovereign Gold Bond



**Sovereign Gold Bond**, abbreviated as SGB, is a government security issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of the Government of India. It is denominated in grams of gold and is linked to the price of gold in India. It is also an interest-bearing bonds, carrying an interest of 2.5% p.a. paid in two installments in a year.

The bond has an 8-year term with an option for early withdrawal through the RBI after 5 years. It is listed and traded on Indian stock exchanges, allowing eligible investors to buy or sell anytime through their dematerialization accounts. It can also be transferred to another eligible investor without redemption through the RBI.

The scheme was discontinued in 2024 due to being an expensive method of borrowing for the government. Previously issued bonds were not affected.


## History

The scheme was introduced due to a forex crisis caused by high gold imports. It was launched by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in an event in New Delhi on 5 November 2015. The event was also attended by the Union Minister for Finance Arun Jaitley, the Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha and the Minister of State for Commerce & Industry Nirmala Sitharaman. The Gold Monetisation Scheme, Indian Gold Coins and Sovereign Gold Bonds were all launched in the same event.

It was first notified by the Department of Economic Affairs on 14 January 2016 under the Government Securities Act, 2006. The initial subscription required a minimum of 2 grams and a maximum of 500 grams. It was open from January 18 to January 22, 2016. The bonds initially paid 2.75% interest per year, later reduced to 2.5% per year. The bonds were sold through banks, post offices and through online securities brokers which would allow investors to hold the bonds in demat form.

In August 2024, the investors who would have redeemed the bonds issued in August 2016 lost suffered a loss due a fall in the price of gold. This fall was linked to the slash in import duty on gold from 15% to 6% during the 2024 Union budget of India.

After the final redemption of the 2016-I series, it was rumoured that the scheme was turning out to be very expensive for the Indian government, due to an unexpected rise in the prices of gold. The government also felt SGBs have also not served the purpose for which it was launched, which was to bring down gold imports by trying to move demand from physical gold to an electronic form. In addition, the RBI has not issued any new series after February 2024. The government also made physical gold purchases more attractive, by lowering the import duty from 15% to 6%. After the 2025 Union budget of India, Minister of Finance Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed that the government had no plans of launching more tranches of SGBs. Economic Affairs Secretary Ajay Seth said that it had turned out to be a high cost method of borrowing for the government compared to traditional bonds and that they had not seen the expected reductions in import of gold. He said that it made no fiscal sense to continue with a scheme that was not beneficial for both the government and the economy.
