This fund was created as a living memorial for his wife, who spent her childhood in Central and South America.

All graduates of this program (a number of whom are from Central and South America) are an integral part of an international network of lawyers who, through their teaching and practice, strive to develop a global human rights culture.Rita Bahr Scholars for 2012:

Audrey Mena (Colombia) is an Afro-Colombian human rights lawyer who earned her law degree from the Technological University of Chocó in 2010. Inhabited largely by the descendants of African slaves brought by Colombia's Spanish colonizers, the department of Chocó is economically, ethnically and culturally distinct from the majority population in Colombia. Ms. Mena's research and advocacy focus on the human rights violations experienced by Afro-Colombians in Chocó, which result from crushing poverty, socio-environmental conflicts that result from illegal gold mining, and violence from guerillas and paramilitaries who seek to control this remote jungle for coca cultivation and drug smuggling routes. In 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Bogota awarded Ms. Mena the Martin Luther King Jr. Fellowship for Young Afro-Colombian Leaders, recognizing her exceptional potential as an advocate for racial and environmental justice in Colombia.

Sara Milena Ferrer (Colombia), also an Afro-Colombian human rights lawyer, earned her law degree from the University of Cartagena in 2008. After graduation, Ms. Ferrer became the first graduate of her law school to receive a clerkship with the Colombian Constitutional Court, one of the most highly regarded constitutional tribunals in the world. As a clerk for Justice Sierra Porto, her work includes writing draft decisions for cases involving economic, social and cultural rights violations. Ms. Ferrer also works for Racial Discrimination Watch in Bogota, where she provides guidance to Afro-Colombian organizations in their effort to seek reparations for victims of extrajudicial violence from Colombia's armed conflict.

Christian Gonzalez (Guatemala) earned his LL.B. magna cum laude from the Jesuit Rafael Landivar University in 2010, where he is also completing an M.A. in philosophy. Mr. Gonzalez became involved in human rights work through assisting two alumni of the CCHR's human rights program in successfully representing the family of Florencio Chitay Nech before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights; the Court held Guatemala responsible for the 1981 forced disappearance of Mr. Chitay Nech, an indigenous Mayan political leader. Currently, Mr. Gonzalez works for a law firm where he represents victims of human rights violations and government corruption before domestic tribunals.
