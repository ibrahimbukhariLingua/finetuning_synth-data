**2012– Going out**

Following the trend of internationalization of the Chinese currency, China Chengxin Credit Management Company Limited established its subsidiary in Hong Kong, China Chengxin (Asia Pacific) Credit Ratings Company Limited, which received the Type Ten License from Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission on 28 June 2012, thus became the first Chinese credit rating company going out of the Chinese mainland to do credit rating business in the international capital markets.


## China Chengxin (Asia Pacific)

On 28 June 2012, China Chengxin (Asia Pacific) Credit Ratings Company Limited (“CCXAP”) was successful in applying for the type ten operating licence from Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, thus, became the first licensed Chinese credit rating agency to operate in the international credit rating market.


## Suspension of License in China

On 29 December 2020, CCXI was suspended by NAFMII, a Chinese interbank market regulator, for three months out of a high-profile bond default case of Yongcheng Coal & Electricity Holding Group. The Chinese regulator discovered that China Chengxin had failed to properly conduct on-site due diligence on Yongcheng or adequately disclose risks, and urged the rating agency to take corrective steps.

During the suspension, CCXI is not allowed to conduct new rating business for debt financing instruments.

In 2024, CCXI is allegedly under an on-going investigation by China Securities Regulatory Commission amongst financial intermediaries who provided financial services to Evergrande Group. According to public information, CCXI assigned "AAA" ratings to five bonds issued by Evergrande since 2020.

As the Evergrande scandal continue to ferment, on 5 July 2024, the Office of the State Council of China published "Opinions on Further Improving the Comprehensive Punishment and Prevention of Financial Fraud in the Capital Market", issued jointly by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Ministry of Public Security (China), Ministry of Finance (China), People's Bank of China, National Financial Regulatory Administration (China) and State Asset Supervision and Administration Committee of the State Council. The article 15 states "Strengthen the “gatekeeper” responsibilities of intermediaries. .... Improve the credit records of intermediary agencies and employees, and urge relevant agencies and personnel to be diligent and responsible. Intermediaries that have committed serious violations of laws and regulations shall be suspended or prohibited from engaging in securities service business in accordance with the law, and systems such as revocation of practice licenses and prohibition of employees shall be strictly implemented." While the Evergrande-related investigation to CCXI is on-going and not yet concluded, the Chinese public is expecting the intermediary responsibility to enforced in a strong hand manner after the announcement.


## Ultimate Owner of CCXI

According to Wuhan University's alumni page, Mao Zhenhua was born in 1964 in Shishou, Hubei. He received his bachelor degree from economics department of School of Economics and Management, Wuhan University in 1983. He was awarded the doctoral degree in economics from Wuhan University in 1996.

Allegedly, in the early age of Mao's business career, he had been detained and subject to official investigation for 8 months.

Mao has been vocal in macro economy issues in China. In 2018, a video of Mao criticizing the Chinese government for "taking advantage of him" and "fooling him" went viral in China.
