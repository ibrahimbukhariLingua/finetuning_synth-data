## History

Friedrich Emil Haeberli founded the brokerage firm Haeberli & Cie 1924. After Haeberli's death Jakob Vontobel took over the brokerage firm 1936 and established the limited partnership J. Vontobel & Co. The son of Jakob Vontobel, Dr. Hans Vontobel (1916–2016), joined the bank 1943. Jakob Vontobel's grandson, Hans-Dieter Vontobel, started working for the bank in 1972.

The Bank J. Vontobel & Co. was transformed into a limited liability company in 1983. Vontobel Holding AG was listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange in 1986, the introduction of the standard registered share followed in 2001.

In 1984, Vontobel expanded into the US and founded Vontobel USA Inc. Other locations abroad followed later. Raiffeisen Switzerland acquired a 12.5 percent stake in Vontobel Holding AG in 2004. The Vontobel family and the charitable Vontobel Foundation retained the majority of the share capital. In 2016 Vontobel strengthened its collaboration with Raiffeisen acquiring former Raiffeisen subsidiary Vescore AG. In 2009 Vontobel took over the Commerzbank (Schweiz) AG in Zurich.

Vontobel acquired a majority stake in TwentyFour Asset Management LLP in London, completed in 2021, when Vontobel acquired the remaining 40%. In the same year Bank Finter was purchased, this was followed in 2018 by the takeover of Notenstein La Roche from Raiffeisen Switzerland and in 2022 by the acquisition of the UBS Swiss Financial Advisers. The acquisition of a significant minority stake in the private infrastructure manager Ancala Partners LLP, London, marks a milestone in delivering on the firm's strategy to enter private markets.


## Shareholder structure

The majority of the share capital is held by the Vontobel family and the Vontobel Foundation in the form of a pooling agreement. Two fourth-generation family members are represented on the Vontobel Board of Directors.
