# Rawls College of Business



The **Rawls College of Business** **Jerry S. Rawls College of Business Administration**, commonly referred to as **Rawls Business**) is the business school of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. Rawls Business offers curriculum for both undergraduate and graduate students (including doctoral) and received its initial business accreditation in 1958 from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Established in 1942, Texas Tech's business school was originally known as the Division of Commerce. In 1956, the school was renamed the College of Business Administration. Following a $25 million gift from alumnus Jerry S. Rawls in 2000, the school was renamed as Jerry S. Rawls College of Business Administration.

The college is organized into five departments, called areas, and a separately accredited professional accounting school. Rawls Business also offers dual degrees in conjunction with architecture, agriculture, foreign language, law, medicine, pharmacy, and environmental toxicology. The MD/MBA in Health Organization Management (HOM) allows medical students the opportunity to obtain both an MD and MBA degree over four years and is ranked in 2009 by *Business Week* as 19th among such programs. The International Business program helps Rawls Business students study abroad. In addition, the Executive Education Department develops seminars, conferences, and training programs for professionals and managers in business, government, and industry.


## History

Business classes were first offered at Texas Tech in 1927, only two years after the university began holding classes in 1925.

Established in 1942, Texas Tech's business school was initially known as the Division of Commerce. In 1956, the school was renamed the College of Business Administration. In 2000, the school was formally renamed as the Jerry S. Rawls College of Business Administration, following a $25 million (equivalent to $44.23 million in 2023) gift from alumnus Jerry S. Rawls.

The new Rawls Business building opened in 2012. The building was constructed on the site of the former Thompson/Gaston Hall. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certified building reused materials from the demolished structure.

In 2013, the Area of Accounting became the School of Accounting, the first separately accredited accounting school in the state.

## Facility

Rawls Business is located on the Lubbock campus of Texas Tech University, which is situated in the rural, South Plains region of West Texas. The campus of Rawls Business sits on the northwest gateway of the Texas Tech campus, near the 9th Street bridge over the Marsha Sharp Freeway and across from the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center campus and University Medical Center. Prior to the current building, Rawls Business occupied the now College of Media & Communication, and the former English-Philosophy building. Rawls Business began occupying their current building in 2012, and completed an addition in 2016.

The new 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m²) building includes classrooms, breakout rooms, student lounges, study areas, food service, and a career management center. The building is a LEED-certified facility, incorporating the latest green technology into all offices and classrooms. The $70 million capital campaign for the project was co-chaired by Alan White, chairman and CEO of Plains Capital Corporation, and Jack Hightower, chairman and CEO of Celero Energy. The new building is located on the north end of campus at the previous site of Thompson and Gaston Halls. The building was originally planned to be constructed south of the Merket Alumni Center, but was relocated after complaints from the Texas Tech Alumni Association. Other sites considered included the southwest corner of University and Broadway, where Weeks Hall is located. The building is constructed in Spanish Renaissance theme and creates a north campus gateway. The process of clearing the site began with a ceremony on September 20, 2008. Ground-breaking for the new building took place in September 2009, and the building opened for class in the Spring of 2012.

The Rawls Business Building grounds feature three sculptures, including two from the percent for art program used to fund public art on campuses of Texas Tech University System member universities. The installation art located in the eastern courtyard, *We are in the Business of Changing the World* by Joe Barrington and Tara Conley, was commissioned to coincide with the opening of the building; the sculpture features a bronze bear and stainless steel bull on either side of an illuminated archway of two sets of stainless steel pipes with identical bases that tendril either upwards or downwards at their ends relating to their adjacent market trend-inspired statues. A second installation was commissioned as part of the 2016 building addition; *Illuminated Arboreal Data Codes* by Koryn Rolstad, is a group of 13 tree-like forms depicting graphic elements of telecommunication circuits with four concrete bands extending from the watershed base, each engraved with a different text language: cuneiform, morse code, braille, and binary. Located inside the western courtyard, *CEO* by Glenna Goodacre is a 6-foot, 4-inch bronze statue of a young businesswoman that her daughter Jill Goodacre Connick modeled for in 1985; after a previous attempt to purchase the statue when the building initially opened, it was gifted by Goodacre to the college prior to her retirement in 2016.

Construction on the previous Rawls Business building broke ground in 1966 and opened in 1968. It has 200,000 square feet (19,000 m²), 176 offices, and 36 classrooms spread across 13 floors, including a basement. The 208-foot (63 m) building is the third-tallest in Lubbock, and the tallest on the Texas Tech University campus.
