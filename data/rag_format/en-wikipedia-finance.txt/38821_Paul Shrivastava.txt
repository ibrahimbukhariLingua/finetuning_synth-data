## Research emphases

Shrivastava's major contributions to the field of business management are concepts for understanding strategic industrial and environmental crises and crisis management, corporate strategies for sustainability and sustainable strategic management. His contributions to management practice include crisis management techniques, environmental and sustainability strategies, and use of the arts for creativity and sustainability programs.

Shrivastava's professional work is rooted in a concern for human-technology-nature relationships. Having grown up in the small town of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh in the 1950s and 60s, he was enchanted by the promise of technology to improve the lives of people. He studied engineering in college and graduated first (gold medal) in his mechanical engineering class. He received a Post Graduate Diploma in Management at IIM Calcutta and Ph.D. from University of Pittsburgh. The Bhopal disaster (the worst industrial accident in history) revealed the two-headedness of technology, and he turned to examining the risks and crises associated with industrial technologies, leading to systematic studies of crisis management. The field of crisis management has emerged since then as a vital field of study.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It is concerned with identifying systemic causes and consequences of crises. It has led to development of crisis management and crisis prevention practices in the areas of industrial disasters, computer disasters, risk management, worker safety, metals mining and oil industries.

He developed "embodied learning" methods wherein concepts are intertwined with physically and emotionally engaging activities to create learning experiences that endure and transform. His course "Managing with Passion" is an events management course in which students learn by planning, organizing, training for and participating in a real event – a USA Triathlon sanctioned public triathlon race. Students gain understanding of concepts that are interwoven with physical activities, emotional activities, cognitive exercises and online activities.

An element in Shrivastava's professional work is the creation of new organizations. In 1976, along with six entrepreneurs from Microcomp Pvt. Ltd., and eSocrates, Inc., he helped launch the HCL Enterprise group of computer companies. He has also created academic organizations such as the ONE Division of the Academy of Management, the David O'Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise, the World Business School Council for Sustainable Business and non-profit organizations (Industrial Crisis Institute). He has co-founded two academic journals: *Industrial Crisis Quarterly* published by Elsevier, and *Organization & Environment* published by SAGE Publications. He is steering WBSCSB in collaboration with UN-Principles of Responsible Management Education and Global Responsible Leadership Initiative, to create a report on the Next 50 Years of Management Education to be presented at Rio+20 Conference in May 2012.

Shrivastava has been studying corporate sustainability for the past two decades. Despite the scientific understanding of global climate change, global poverty, and biodiversity decline, global leaders are unable to reach effective international agreements to address these challenges. He suggests that science alone will not solve the problem of sustainability. Humans have to find a new way of engaging nature, that allows them to care and preserve it in enduring ways.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Shrivastava is extending the scientific understanding of sustainability to the realm of the arts, which as the repository of human emotions offer a vehicle for creating passionate engagement between humans and nature. This project uses transdisciplinary approaches to science and arts in aesthetic inquiry into sustainability issues. This collaboration of a dozen researchers in France, Canada, USA and India, has produced results including the Balance unBalance 2011 conference and Montreal Degrowth 2012 conference.

His work has been featured in *The Los Angeles Times*, *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, *The Christian Science Monitor*, *The Globe and Mail*, and *The Montreal Gazette*, and on the *MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour*
