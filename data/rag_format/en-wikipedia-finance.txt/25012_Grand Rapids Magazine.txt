## History

John H. Zwarensteyn first published *Grand Rapids Magazine* as a staff member of the Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce during the 1970s and purchased the publication when the chamber decided to sell it in 1979. A year later he bought out his business partners and formed Gemini Publications. In 1983, *Grand Rapids Magazine* began to take on more of a consumer focus as Gemini began publishing the *Grand Rapids Business Journal*—first as a monthly business-to-business newspaper—then in 1986, as a weekly.

On September 1, 2018, Gemini Publications was acquired by Hour Media of Detroit, Michigan. The new name of the company is Gemini Media LLC. In 2022, Crain Communications acquired the *Grand Rapids Business Journa*l from Gemini.
