The **European Communities (Finance) Act 2008** (c. 1) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was given Royal Assent and became law on 19 February 2008.


## Passage

The legislation was introduced to the House of Commons as the European Communities (Finance) Bill by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, on 7 November 2007. The Bill was read for the third time in the House of Commons on 15 January 2008 and passed to the House of Lords with a vote of 309 for to 208 against.


## Effect

The Act passes into UK law the decisions on the European Union budget taken at the European Council meeting of December 2005 as recorded in the *Council's Decision of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources*. It does this by amending the introductory paragraph of the European Communities Act 1972 to include reference to the 7 June 2007 decision. The Act supersedes and repeals the European Communities (Finance) Act 2001.

On 22 May 2008, in answer to a Parliamentary question by Lord Burnett, Lord Davies of Oldham provided an estimate on the additional costs to Her Majesty's Treasury as a result of the Act. The total cost was estimated at between £6.3 billion and £7.2 billion for the financial period 2007 to 2013.
