## Biography

Mackersy was born in Edinburgh on 21 April 1891 to William Robert Mackersy WS and Mary Luke Callum. Mackersy came to Canada in 1911 and that December joined the Imperial Bank in Toronto and was sent to the bank's branch in Red Deer, Alberta.

In World War I, Mackersy served as an officer in the Royal Garrison Artillery in Malta and France. He was awarded the military cross.

After the war, Mackersy rejoined the bank in Vancouver. In January 1923 he was appointed an accountant in Nelson, British Columbia, and then in April 1927 an accountant in Edmonton. In August 1929 he was appointed assistant manager in Edmonton, in February 1936 assistant western superintendent in Winnipeg, and in January 1942 manager in Winnipeg.
