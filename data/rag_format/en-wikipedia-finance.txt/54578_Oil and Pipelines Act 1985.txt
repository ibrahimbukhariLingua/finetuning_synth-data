Oil and Pipelines Act 1985


# Oil and Pipelines Act 1985



The **Oil and Pipelines Act 1985** (c. 62) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which established the Oil and Pipelines Agency to buy, sell or deal in petroleum and to manage on behalf of the Crown petroleum pipelines and storage installations. The act abolished the British National Oil Corporation and transferred its assets to the Agency.


## Background

The government had established the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) in 1975 under the provisions of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. BNOC, as constituted, was effectively two businesses: firstly for the production of oil and petroleum, and secondly for trading in oil. The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 enabled the government to transfer the upstream oil exploration and production side of the BNOC's business into Britoil, a limited liability company. Britoil was floated on the stock market in November 1982 and again in August 1985. The downstream trading side of the business remained within BNOC. However, by 1983 with falling oil prices, participation and trading in the petroleum markets ceased to be profitable for BNOC. The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 provided the legal mechanism whereby BNOC was abolished and the Crown's interest in petroleum pipelines and storage installations was transferred into a new corporate body, the **Oil and Pipelines Agency**.
