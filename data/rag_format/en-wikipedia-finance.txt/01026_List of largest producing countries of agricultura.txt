List of largest producing countries of agricultural commodities


# List of largest producing countries of agricultural commodities



Production (and consumption) of agricultural plant commodities has a diverse geographical distribution. Along with climate and corresponding types of vegetation, the economy of a nation also influences the level of agricultural production. Production of some products is highly concentrated in a few countries, China, the leading producer of wheat and ramie in 2013, produces 95% of the world's ramie fiber but only 17% of the world's wheat. Products with more evenly distributed production see more frequent changes in the ranking of the top producers.

The major agricultural products can be broadly categorised into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials.
