## History

China Everbright Holdings, a Chinese state-owned enterprise based in Hong Kong, took over a listed company in Hong Kong in 1993 (Newfoundland International [zh] Chinese: 寧發國際有限公司, incorporated in 1961) and injected part of the group's business into the listed company.

In 2012, vice-chairman Li Xueming resigned, following rumour on his true name and identity as the elder brother of arrested government officials Bo Xilai.

In 2017, Everbright Greentech (SEHK: 1257) was split from the company.
