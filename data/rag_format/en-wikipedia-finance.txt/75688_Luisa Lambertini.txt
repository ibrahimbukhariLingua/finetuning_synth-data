## Research

Lambertini's research concerns the interplay of monetary and fiscal policies, in the inclusion of housing and mortgage default into macro-economic models, and in the analysis of regulation and macro-prudential policies in models with financial institutions.

Lambertini develops models of general equilibrium macroeconomic for the investigation of economic policies that alleviate the impact of economic crises. Her research has influenced the design of monetary and fiscal institutions as it has elucidated which interactions of monetary and fiscal policy may lead to sub-optimal equilibria. Her research illuminates the impact of austerity on competitiveness and growth. She also contributed to the development of macro-prudential regulation for banks and its effect on financial stability and lending.
