## History

Planasa Group’s origin dates back to the year 1887 and was formally established in 1973 under the name of Plantas de Navarra, S.A., by Amand Marc Darbonne and Caja de Ahorros de Navarra.

In its early years, the company focused on strawberry and asparagus breeding and endives production. In 2003, Planasa introduced the Sabrosa strawberry variety in the market, commercially known as Candonga. It was followed by the Sabrina variety in 2010. Both varieties ranked among the most popular strawberries worldwide and dominate numerous growing regions, including Spain and Italy. Also in between 2010 and 2011 operations started in Mexico and the USA.

In 2014 the group acquired California Endive Farms. This made Planasa one of the leading producers of endives in the world.

In 2003 the Group Darbonne took control of the 100% of Planasa until 2017, when the majority of the company’s shares (65%) were acquired by Cinven, a British private equity firm based in London. While the other 35% was held by the Group Darbonne, with Alexandre Pierron-Darbonne as CEO.

In 2018, Planasa launched the Savana and Sayulita strawberry varieties. And two years later, released a new generation of six blueberry varieties, the leading ones being Blue Manila, Blue Malibu, Blue Maldiva and Blue Madeira. Michael Brinkmann was appointed CEO of Planasa in 2020. In 2021, Planasa entered the blackberry breeding and marketing sector with Black Sultana.

During 2021/22, new strawberry varieties RedSayra and Demoiselle, as well as Pink Hudson, a raspberry variety, were brought to the market. Also in 2022 Planasa legally constituted Planasa South Africa, to expand the cultivation of its blueberry varieties in the main growing countries in Southern Africa.

One year later, in 2023, Planasa acquired 100% of its subsidiary in China. And in 2024 100% of Hansabred, in German, thus expanding its northern strawberry variety portfolio.

In 2023 the EW Group purchased 100% of the company.
