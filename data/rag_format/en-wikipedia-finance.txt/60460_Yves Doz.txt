## Work

Doz's earlier work was primarily focused on the strategies of large multinationals in a globalizing competitive environment. His 1986 book looked at the organizational and strategic drivers of success in multinationals. In his subsequent 1987 book with CK Prahalad, *The Multinational Mission*, he analyzed the trade-off between national responsiveness and global strategy. His 2001 book with José Santos and Peter Williamson, *From Global to Metanational*, argued that the primary challenge for businesses in a global knowledge economy was the management of innovation and leaning across boundaries. His principal work on strategic alliances is his 1998 book with Gary Hamel, *Alliance Advantage*, which explores how strategic partnerships evolve over time and how capabilities in alliance management can be a sustainable source of competitive advantage.

More recently, Doz has developed ideas around the drivers of strategic agility and the management of global innovation. In his 2008 book with former Nokia executive Mikko Kosonen, *Fast Strategy*, Doz drew on interviews with 150 executives to identify the capabilities that successful companies must possess if they are to adapt successfully to changes in the competitive environment that challenge their existing business models and strategies. In a parallel stream of work he developed ideas on managing innovation and learning in global organizations, which culminated in a 2012 book with Keeley Wilson, *Managing Global Innovation*, that presented frameworks for addressing the challenge of sourcing and disseminating innovations and best practices in a global network. Most recently, he has been exploring the application of the ideas on organizational and strategic agility developed in *Fast Strategy* with a number of national and regional governments, including Finland and Scotland.
