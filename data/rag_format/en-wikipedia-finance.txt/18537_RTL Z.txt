# RTL Z



**RTL Z** is a Dutch free-to-cable business and financial news television channel. It displays economic changes and the stock exchange news in a banner at the bottom of the screen in the daytime. In the evenings the programming consists of documentaries.


## History

RTL Z started on 6 June 2001 as a joint venture between Holland Media Groep and Belgian Business Television. Belgian Business Television broadcasts **Kanaal Z** (Canal Z) in Belgium. In 2002, Holland Media Groep took over the programme in its entirety. It was initially broadcast as a programming block on RTL 5 during daytime, and later on RTL 7 from 12 August 2005 until 6 September 2015.

It became a 24-hour channel on September 7, 2015, so that the block on RTL 7 ended. At launch, the new standalone version was available to six million households, but was not available on all basic cable subscriptions, as agreements were only signed with KPN, Ziggo and Vodafone.

On 7 January 2019, RTL Z introduced a new daytime schedule re-emphasizing news and weather.
