**Cinven Limited** is a global private equity firm founded in 1977, with offices in nine international locations in Guernsey, London, New York, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Luxembourg, Madrid, and Hong Kong that acquires Europe and United States–based corporations, and emerging market firms that fit with their core businesses, and necessitate a minimum equity investment of €100 million or more. As of 2024, it has €44 billion in assets under management.

Cinven's funding base originally came solely from three pension funds in the United Kingdom (British Coal, the Railway Industry and Barclays Bank) who remain as important investors. Cinven has been reported to originally stand for *Coal Investment Nominees' for Venture Capital*.

Cinven invests in six sectors on an international basis: Business Services; Technology, Media and Telecommunications; Financial Services; Industrials; Healthcare; and Consumer.

In July 2021, the firm was fined £43m by the UK Competition and Markets Authority for its part in a generic drug pricefixing scandal, which had resulted in the National Health Service being overcharged by "hundreds of millions of pounds" over several years.

In January 2024, Cinven raised $14.5 billion for its eighth private equity fund.
