## Products


### Push to Talk Plus (PoC+)

Push to Talk Plus, also known as PoC+, is an application that uses a method of conversing on half-duplex communication lines, including two-way radio, using a momentary button to switch from voice reception mode to transmit mode. It uses a service option for a cellular phone network which permits subscribers to use their phone as a walkie-talkie with unlimited range. One significant advantage of PoC+ is that it allows a single person to reach an active talk group with a single button press; users need not make several calls to coordinate with a group.
