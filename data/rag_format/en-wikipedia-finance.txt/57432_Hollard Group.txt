## Social impact insurance

It will create a specialized risk assessment entity that will measure and manage risks associated with the funding of social impact organizations. It will apply tested rating methodologies and risk management principles to facilitate the underwriting of social impact funding. HUGinsure’s service will help funders assess the credit worthiness of social projects and organizations so they can deploy capital with confidence, accelerating the timely flow of funds to social organizations and preventing disruptions in their operations and impact.

Social Impact Insurance is any insurance or insurance related product or service provided with the intention to generate measurable social and environmental impact together with a financial return. Social Impact Insurance can be applied in both emerging and developed markets, and target underwriting outcomes from below market to market norms, depending upon the circumstances and degree of social impact achieved. As with Social Impact Investing, Social Impact Insurance tends to have its roots in either social, development, or environmental issues. Social Impact Insurers actively look to provide risk mitigation products and services to socially relevant projects in a manner that enhances the probability of success whether by enhancing credit worthiness to attract investment and or to speed up or stabilise cash flows or protecting people processes and assets against the multitude of risks which may otherwise hamper success to the detriment of society.

Impact Insurers are primarily distinguished by their intention to address social and environmental challenges through the provision of insurance coverage. For example, criteria to evaluate the positive social and/or environmental outcomes of investments or project that may benefit from insurance coverage are an integrated component of the underwriting processes.

Social Impact Insurance can be in the form of insurance including Credit, Marine, Property Damage, Engineering and Construction, Liability, and Life Insurance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
