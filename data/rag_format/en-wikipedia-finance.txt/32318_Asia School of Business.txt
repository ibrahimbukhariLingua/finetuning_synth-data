# Asia School of Business



The **Asia School of Business (ASB)** is a graduate business school based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

It offers a range of programs, including a 12-month **Master of Business Administration (MBA)**, a 16-month **Executive MBA (EMBA)**, and a 12-month **Master in Central Banking (MCB)**.

ASB integrates MIT Sloan’s academic rigor with insights into the challenges and opportunities of emerging markets. Its dual-campus format allows students to study at ASB’s campus in Kuala Lumpur and MIT Sloan’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The curriculum is delivered by MIT Sloan faculty and resident ASB professors, many of whom hold positions as MIT Sloan International Faculty Fellows.

Graduates of ASB are awarded Affiliate Alumni status with MIT Sloan, providing access to its global network of resources and connections. The school emphasizes experiential learning and leadership development, preparing students to address complex global challenges and opportunities in dynamic economies.


## History

The Asia School of Business was co-founded in 2015 by **Zeti Akhtar Aziz**, then Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia, and **Professor Richard Schmalensee**, Dean Emeritus of the MIT Sloan School of Management. The institution began operations in 2016, offering a full-time MBA program. The inaugural cohort, known as the Class of 2018, commenced their studies in the fall of 2016, with the first graduation ceremony held in the spring of 2018.

In 2019, ASB introduced the MBA for Working Professionals, a 22-month modular program designed to accommodate the needs of working professionals. This program was later rebranded as the Executive MBA (EMBA) to better reflect its structure and target audience.

Significant developments occurred in 2020, including the merger of ASB with **The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre**, forming the ASB Iclif Executive Education Center (Iclif) to enhance its executive education offerings. That same year, the school relocated to its newly built 30-acre campus in Kuala Lumpur, designed to support innovative teaching and foster leadership development.

ASB aims to serve as a global hub for knowledge and learning, integrating MIT Sloan’s academic framework with regional expertise from Asia and emerging markets. The school’s research and partnerships focus on areas such as emerging markets, business strategy, technology, and sustainability. In 2020, ASB was ranked as Malaysia's top economic research institution by IDEAS, reflecting its impact on research and thought leadership.
