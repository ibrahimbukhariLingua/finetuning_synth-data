## Author

Since his youth Van Tiggelen had a passion for fantasy literature, which led him to write fantasy novels himself.
In 2006 his first book *Devil's Prophet* appeared in a limited edition at Gopher publishers. In 2008 he signed a contract with Luitingh-Sijthoff, the Netherlands' largest publisher of speculative fiction and fantasy, on which basis Luitingh-Sijthoff re-published *Devil's Prophet* in April 2009, followed in June 2009 by *Devil's Son*.
The third part of the *Devil's Soul trilogy*, appeared in April 2010. All books are published under the pseudonym **Adrian Stone**.

After the Devil Trilogy Stone wrote the *Rune* Duology, which is situated in the same world. The first part *The Eighth Rune* was published in September 2011, the second part *The First God* in September 2012.

After *Rune*, Stone wrote a new series (title: *Magycker*), which plays in a completely new world. The first part *The Claw* was published in 2016. The second and final part *Dragon Heart* was published on 26 October 2021.
