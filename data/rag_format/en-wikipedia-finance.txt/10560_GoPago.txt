# GoPago



**GoPago** (pronounced ‘go’-’PAY’-’go’) was a cloud-based mobile payment platform with an integrated point of sale system, based in Pasadena, CA. GoPago's payment platform allows customers to purchase orders in advance of arriving at brick-and-mortar merchants and merchants to manage orders in real-time. In August 2012, GoPago released GoPago LIVE, an application-based tablet point of sale system, which are free to merchants. GoPago's mobile payments platform is cloud-based, which allows transactions processing without near-field communications or QR-code technologies. On December 11, 2013, Amazon (Global Payment Services) reached an agreement with GoPago to buy a license to its technology and hire certain members of its engineering team. On December 20, 2013, mobile commerce company DoubleBeam acquired all of the assets of GoPago, including all customers, systems, products, brand name and IP portfolio. On February 20, 2015, DoubleBeam was acquired by Verifone, Inc, and GoPago was subsequently rebranded as Verifone Cloud POS.


## History

GoPago was originally conceived in 2007. Rocco believed there was a need to bridge the gap between merchants and customers. Specially, enabling consumers to skip the line and not have to wait to put in their order. This was the first true order ahead experience. For merchants it helped streamline operations and create more orders beyond walk in traffic. Customers should be able to easily and quickly order and purchase goods in advance through their mobile device, while merchants should be able to easily access and manage potential customers.

GoPago launched its mobile app on August 9, 2011, as Pago, in Mountain View, CA. After piloting with restaurants in Mountain View, Pago rebranded as GoPago and went live in San Francisco on April 3, 2012. GoPago has plans to expand to Dallas, New York, and cities across the U.S. GoPago also made an appearance working with food trucks inside the Microsoft Bing area at SxSW Interactive in March 2012.
