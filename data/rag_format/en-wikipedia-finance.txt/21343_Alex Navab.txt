**Alex Navab** (November 24, 1965 – July 7, 2019) was an American financier who was the head of the Americas Private Equity Business of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and possible successor to the firm.


## Early life

Navab was born on November 24, 1965, in Isfahan, to an Iranian father and Greek mother, Dr. Ali and Katina (Armenakis) Navab. His father was a physician. The family fled for Greece after the Iranian revolution in 1979 and then moved to the United States. He graduated from Columbia College as Phi Beta Kappa in 1987 and Harvard Business School in 1991.


## Career

He worked at Goldman Sachs and James D. Wolfensohn, Inc. before joining KKR in 1993. During his time at KKR, he oversaw its takeover of the Nielsen Company, Yellow Pages and Borden. Navab became co-president of KKR's American private equity business in 2008. He became the sole president in 2014. He helped the firm raise $13.9 billion, one of the biggest of its kind. He was the youngest partner at KKR.

Navab sat on the management committee of KKR and was considered by many in the industry to be a candidate to succeed Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts. However, he was reported to have health issues which raised concerns about his prospects of succession. After two other executives, Scott C. Nuttall and Joseph Bae, were promoted to co-presidents, he departed KKR in 2017 and launched his own buyout firm, Navab Capital Partners.
