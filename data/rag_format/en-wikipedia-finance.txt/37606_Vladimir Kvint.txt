**Vladimir Kvint**


## Early life

Vladimir Kvint was born in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia into a family of engineers. He studied in Railroad elementary and junior high school before moving to Norilsk. He began his 14-year career in the non-ferrous metals industry at the age of 14 as a construction and metal worker. Most of Kvint's education was completed in parallel with his professional and athletic activities (boxing). Kvint established himself as the chief economist and vice chairman of a major Russian high-tech company, successfully earned his Ph.D. in economics, and was educated in the fields of mining-electrical engineering and law by the age of 27.


## Early career in industry


### Norilsk Mining - metallurgical concern - MMC Norilsk Nickel

Despite an invitation to work as an associate professor in Moscow, Kvint returned to Norilsk. Between 1975 and 1978, he continued his work in the mining-metallurgical industry. He founded and was Chief of the Department of Organization Management at the Norilsk Mining – Metallurgical Concern, later renamed MMC Norilsk Nickel, which was the largest Russian enterprise (150,000 employees) and still the largest producer worldwide of nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and osmium. Under his leadership, the company's first general organizational structure, focusing on the strategic improvement of final products was developed. The theoretical results of his work were published in Moscow in 1976, in *The Acceleration of the Industrial-Technical Development*. This book received the USSR's Annual Award "Best Popular Scholarly Book of the Year".


### Sib Tsvemet Automatica

In 1976, Kvint was promoted to the position of deputy director general and deputy chairman of "Sib Tsvemet Automatica", a scientific-technological company, which automated the non-ferrous metals industry throughout the USSR. He was responsible for economic policy, business planning, the organization of compensation systems, and accounting departments in this company of 5,000 employees. Under Kvint's economic strategy, this company became one of the first self-sufficient firms in the USSR, despite the Soviet command planning system. In addition, he was the Chief of the Forecasting Economics Laboratory of the non-ferrous metals and gold industry, and prepared strategies and forecasts for the non-ferrous precious metals and diamond industries.


## Later career in education and lecturing


### Arctic Seaway Economic Expedition

In 1978, he was invited to join the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, and was elected as the Chief of the Department of Regional Problems of Scientific-Technological Progress at the Institute of Economy and Industrial Organization of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The Siberian School of Economics was at that time under the leadership of the economists Abel Aganbegyan and Nobel Laureate in Economics Leonid Kantorovich.

In the Academy, Kvint found a lack of accurate empirical statistics and economic information. As a result, many economic studies based on this incorrect information had no practical use. With Kvint's business experience, he recognized this problem and developed the methods of studying economic situations, natural resources, and strategic business opportunities through the organization of complex economic expeditions.

In 1979 the chairman of the Siberian branch of the Academy appointed him to head these expeditions. Several of these major expeditions were unprecedented. For example, in 1980 the academicians ventured across the entire eight seas of the Arctic Seaway by ship, helicopter and SUV. Another economic expedition traveled through three seas along the entire Pacific Coast of Russia to evaluate the area's natural resources and productive forces.


### Research at the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow)

In 1982, Kvint was elected as a senior researcher and then as the Head of Department and later a leading scholar at the Institute of Economics of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He defined the category of regional scientific-technological policy and the role of this policy in the reduction of poverty and ecological protection. In the late 1980s he came up with the theory of regional and global emerging markets.

In 1986, he wrote the report on the organization of strategic development of scientific-technological process which he brought to the attention of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, explaining that without the activation of these factors and the function of motivation, the Soviet Union would have no economic future. After this predication, Kvint again faced a great deal of pressure from the Soviet power structure.

In 1985, Kvint prepared his second Doctoral dissertation on the "Regional Management of the Scientific-Technological Development of the National Economy". Among the consequences of Kvint's recommendations would have been the decentralization of the Soviet command economy. As a result, he was not allowed to present his dissertation to the Scientific Council until February 1988. In 1989, he received the lifetime title of "Professor of Political Economy". Many years later, in 2011 by decree of the President of the Russian Federation he was awarded with the title of 'Honored professor of Higher Education of the Russian Federation.'

The fundamental ideas of Kvint's theories were explored in his dissertations and books. Since 1989, he has continued his studies in Austria, and then in the United States. However, the development of his theory of the global emerging market has its roots in all of his years of scholarly activity. For these studies, Kvint would later receive international recognition Developing his earlier strategic studies he contributed to theory of strategy and came up with his own theory of holistic strategy.

Since 1990, Kvint has lived and worked in the United States where he has been granted citizenship.
