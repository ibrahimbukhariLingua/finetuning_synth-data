MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund


# MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund



MusiCares' COVID-19 relief effort was a charitable initiative aimed at providing financial and other forms of assistance to musicians and music industry professionals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative was established by MusiCares, a non-profit organization that was founded in 1989 by the Recording Academy, the organization behind the GRAMMY Awards.


## Background

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the music industry with the closure of concert venues, the cancellation of tours, and the loss of income for many music professionals. MusiCares launched its COVID-19 Relief effort in March 2020 to provide assistance to those in need. The central program was **MusiCaresâ€™ COVID-19 Relief Fund** which was established with $1 million from MusiCares and a $1 million dollar donation from The Recording Academy. MusiCares received further donations from companies and individuals within and outside of the music industry, allowing the organization to distribute $35.7 million in emergency financial assistance and provide over 140,000 services to the music community from March 2020 to July 2022. This includes $27.8 million distributed to support over 34,000 customized care cases, many with basic living needs due to loss of work from COVID-19.


## Goals
