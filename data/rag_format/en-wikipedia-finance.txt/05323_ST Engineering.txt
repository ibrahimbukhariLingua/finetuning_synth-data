## History

ST Engineering's history began with its precursor, the Chartered Industries of Singapore, which was established in 1967 by the newly independent Singaporean government as an ammunition manufacturer. Businesses related to aerospace and shipbuilding were later created and put under the ST umbrella. The ST group of companies went commercial in 1990, setting up its first commercial airframe manufacturing, repair and overhaul facilities in Singapore and the United States. ST Engineering was created in December 1997 as a merger of four listed companies: ST Aerospace, ST Electronics, ST Automative and ST Marine. Its shares debuted on the Singapore Exchange on 8 December 1997.

Since then, ST Engineering has grown to become one of Asia's largest defence and engineering groups for commercial and defence organisations across multiple industries. In Mar 2007, ST Engineering was ranked 19th in the aerospace & defence industry and 1,661th of 2,000 of the world's largest public companies by Forbes.

## Controversy

In 2014, ST Engineering and its subsidiaries ST Engineering Marine and ST Engineering Aerospace were hit by one of the largest corruption scandals in Singapore history following investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau.

In December 2014, former ST Engineering Marine and ST Engineering Aerospace president, Chang Cheow Teck, was charged with conspiring with two subordinates to offer bribes in return for ship-repair contracts between 2004 and 2010. The corruption charges were eventually withdrawn and in January 2017, Chang pleaded guilty to "failing to use reasonable diligence in performing his duties" and was given a short detention order of 14 days. Former ST Marine CEO and president See Leong Teck was also charged with seven counts of corruption. In December 2016, See was sentenced to 10 months' jail and a $100,000 fine.

Since then, six other former ST Engineering Marine senior executives were implicated in the corruption scandal, including former financial controller and senior vice-president of finance Ong Tek Liam who pleaded guilty to ten out of 118 charges in relating to the falsification of accounts, former senior vice-president Mok Kim Whang who pleaded guilty to 49 out of 826 corruption charges, ex-chief operating officer Han Yew Kwang who pleaded guilty to 50 out of 407 charges and was sentenced to six months' jail and fined $80,000, former president of commercial business Tan Mong Seng who faced 445 corruption charges and was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail, and ex-financial controller Patrick Lee Swee Ching who pled guilty to seven of 38 charges of conspiring with others between 2004 and 2007 to make false entries in petty cash vouchers, and was given the maximum fine of $210,000.

In June 2017, Ong Teck Liam was sentenced to a fine of SGD300,000 ($217,200), in default 30 weeks’ imprisonment. Ong was the last to be sentenced.
