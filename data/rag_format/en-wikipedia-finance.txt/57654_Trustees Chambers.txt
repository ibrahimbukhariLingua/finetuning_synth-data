Trustees Chambers


# Trustees Chambers



The **Trustees Chambers** is a heritage-listed commercial building located at 43 Queen Street, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is currently used by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. It was designed by Addison & Corrie and built c. 1900 by Walter Taylor. It was also known as ANZ Bank. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.


## History

This building was constructed c. 1900. The site was purchased by the Bank of New South Wales in 1853. In 1866 the bank erected premises on the corner of Queen and George Streets across part of both allotments (later rebuilt as the Bank of New South Wales Building), and the remainder of the site became a garden associated with the bank residence.

In February 1899 the bank decided to construct a building on the remainder of the site and engaged architects Addison and Corrie to design a two storeyed commercial building. Walter Taylor was the contractor, and the building containing offices and shops was completed in late 1900 at a cost of £6,737.

The basement and ground floor were leased to Queensland Trustees Limited, while the upper floors was leased to several legal firms. Queensland Trustees moved to other premises in 1913, but the building remained known as Trustee Chambers.

Alterations to Trustees Chambers were made in late 1933. In November 1935 Trustees Chambers was sold to HA Manahan & Sons Proprietary Limited, chain store grocers. In 1957 the Prudential Assurance Company Limited purchased the building and leased it to the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd. In 1985 ANZ Properties (Australia) Limited became the registered proprietors.

In 2016, the building was available for lease.
