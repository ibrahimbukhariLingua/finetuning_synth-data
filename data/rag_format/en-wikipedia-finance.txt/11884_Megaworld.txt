## History

Megaworld Properties & Holdings Inc. was founded by Andrew Tan and incorporated under Philippine law on August 24, 1989, primarily aimed at engaging in real estate development, leasing, and marketing.

In 1994, it spun off Empire East Land Holdings Inc., which focused on the middle income market. It was converted to a public company on July 15, 1994.

On August 19, 1999, the company changed its name to Megaworld Corporation in line with its conversion from a purely real estate company to a holding company, though the company's core focus continues to be on real estate.

In 2013, the company gained full acquisition of Suntrust Properties.

Andrew Tan has served as Chairman of the Board and President of the company since its incorporation in 1989.

## Controversies


### Trademark dispute with Donald Trump

In 2007, Megaworld renamed a high-rise condominium project formerly called "The Trumps" into "One Central" after American business magnate and eventual 45th President of the United States Donald Trump, who threatened legal action over the name, saying the name "Trump" was unmistakably associated with him.


### Allegations of fraud by Datem, Inc.

On November 14, 2023, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court issued a court order to freeze Megaworld's assets in relation to projects involving Datem Inc., a construction company in the Philippines. Datem alleged that Megaworld "failed to fulfill its obligation to Megaworld in completing the projects that have been assigned to them."

In response, Megaworld announced that it will file criminal and civil cases against Datem. Megaworld denied the allegations, decried that the freeze order was absurd because Datem's claims only accounts for 0.2% of Megaworld's assets, and claimed that it "has not evaded any substantial claim for payments from Datem."
