## Inorbit Malad

Inorbit Mall, Malad was the first shopping mall to open under the Inorbit umbrella. The mall was launched in 2004 in Malad, Mumbai. It is also the fourth oldest shopping mall in Mumbai. The mall has a gross leasable area of 500,000 sq ft (46,000 m²). It was designed by architectural firm *P.G. Patki and Associates* and is counted among the better planned malls in the city. At the time, it claimed to be the biggest mall property in South East Asia, housing Mumbai's largest food court. In 2008, the mall was retrofitted for energy efficiency by Johnson Controls Inc under the *Clinton Climate Initiative* (CCI). The property was part of a civil suit, filed in 2008 by industrialist Nusli Wadia, owner of the land which was leased to K Raheja Corporation claiming damages for violation of the said lease. Wadia requested the court to direct the mall be demolished. In 2012, the Bombay High Court recommended that both parties appoint a third party valuer for the property and that the valuation be conducted every six months to calculate the 12% of the realisation figure that Wadia is entitled.

The mall houses 26 restaurants and the foodcourt is spread over 12,000 sq. ft and seats 800 people at a time. The restaurants at Inorbit Malad are sought after and waiting times are as long as three hours for a table. After the Inorbit Malad experience, the company has doubled the number of restaurants in subsequently developed mall spaces. Due to the number of footfalls, the mall hosts a variety of promotional events. In 2007, Panasonic displayed the world's largest plasma screen at Malad. Inorbit Malad frequently hosts Music releases of top bollywood movies. Movies which have had their music launched at the mall include The Dirty Picture and Don. Other bollywood events held at Inorbit Malad include pre-film promotional events attended by filmstars, like one attended by Asin to promote Ready and fashion brand Provogue as well as a launch by socialite Paris Hilton in 2011. Other events that have taken place at Inorbit Malad include an international boxing bout held by World Series of Boxing (WSB) in 2011. It is the first mall in the world to have held such an event. During large sports events such as the Indian Premier League, Inorbit installs large screens in food courts to retain clientele. The mall is said to generate revenues of between 800 million and 840 million per annum and attracts 40,000 visitors each weekend.

In 2010, Inorbit Malad launched "Mall Walk", a scheme where people could use the mall property for their morning walks at no cost. The development of Inorbit Mall has led to street hawkers setting up shop on the opposite side of the road, which was earlier a hawker-free zone. These hawkers synchronise their timings with that of the mall, with mall employees and customers being their clientele. The mall often plays host to cooking classes, self-defence workshops and free music concerts. Post 2017–present, one of the recently added popular stores of the mall is the H&M store which provides fashion wear for kids and adults.

The mall frequently hosts music events called "Live @ Inorbit" and has hosted bands such as *The Yagna*, *Split*, *Live saver*, *Chain reaction* and *Inertia*. In 2010, the mall ran an initiative called *Aikya* where it displayed a sand sculpture of a rhinoceros to promote wildlife conservation.
