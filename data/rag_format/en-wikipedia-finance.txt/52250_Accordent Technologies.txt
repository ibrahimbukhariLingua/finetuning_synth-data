In the content management system market, derived from the need to organize and store created presentations, long standing players such as Oracle, Microsoft's SharePoint, and The Platform have a large market share. Smaller open source content management systems such as Joomla, Moodle and Angel have increased market presence due to their low cost and accessibility to the education market. In this market, more colleges and universities are increasing their online presence, called a Virtual Campus also known as Learning Management Systems. In this Virtual Campus setting, some notable Learning Management Systems such as Sakai, Blackboard, Desire2Learn all compete directly with Accordent Technologies Media Management System in order to manage classroom content, testing and student coursework.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
