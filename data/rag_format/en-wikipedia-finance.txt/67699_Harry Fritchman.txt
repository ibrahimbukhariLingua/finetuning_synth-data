## Early life and education

Fritchman was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in 1865. He was the eighth child in a family of eleven children born to John and Susan (Linn) Fritchman. The family moved to a farm in Andrew County, Missouri, the year of Fritchman's birth. A student at public school in Andrew County, Fritchman learned to read from McGuffey Readers, and he studied Ray's Arithmetic. He left his family farm at age 23 to clerk at Pierce & Roberts grocery in Savannah, Missouri.


## Career

Fritchman moved to St. Joseph, Missouri, and worked for wholesale grocers Nave & McCord. He became a commercial traveler selling wholesale merchandise for Nave & McCord, later for various employers, and his work brought him to Idaho in 1888. He moved to Boise in 1900, but in 1901 he moved again to Portland, Oregon, returning to Boise in 1904. Fritchman built a 2-story warehouse in 1910 and operated a wholesale merchandise and grocery company, acting as agent for 30 manufacturers.

In 1911 he ran for mayor of Boise, winning the election by a comfortable margin, but he served only one year.

In 1912 Fritchman sold his warehouse and a half-interest in his wholesale business to Reilly Atkinson. The new firm operated briefly under the name, Fritchman-Atkinson Co., then as Reilly Atkinson & Co. The Boise Stone Company at Table Rock was organized in 1912 with Fritchman as general manager.

By 1916 Fritchman had become interested in real estate, and he purchased half of the mortgage brokerage firm of Ira E. High & Co. He continued with real estate until his death.
