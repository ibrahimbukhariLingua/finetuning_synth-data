It is headquartered in Cheltenham, England. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.


## History

The company was founded by Herman Sanders in 1888 and after a Mr Rehders joined the business, established as ***Sa**nders, **R**ehders & **Co**.* ('Sarco') in London. Initially, it focused upon the importing of thermostatic steam traps from Germany. During 1932, Sarco commenced the domestic manufacture of steam traps under the *Spirax* brand name. In 1959, it was listed on the London Stock Exchange as *Spirax-Sarco Engineering*.

In 1960, Spirax-Sarco launched its first range of self-acting pressure controls. Three years later, it acquired *Drayton Controls*, a rival control valve and instrumentation business.

During 1990, the company diversified into pump manufacturing via the purchase of *Watson-Marlow*. Three years later, Spirax-Sarco also acquired the *Jucker Industrial Division*, an Italian controls business; another firm, *Bredel Hose Pumps*, a manufacturer of high-pressure hose pumps, followed in 1996. During 2001, *M&M International*, an Italian piston actuated and solenoid valve business was also purchased. In September 2005, it acquired *Mitech Actuators & Controls* and *Proportional Control Technology*, a pair of South African businesses making process controls. Then, later that year, it bought *EMCO Flow Systems*, a metering business.

During 2009, the company acquired *Intervalf*, a Turkish operation, in exchange for £2.8 million. During the following year, it completed a new facility in Shanghai, China: the plant, designed as Spirax's regional headquarters, combines a factory, warehouse, and offices.

In 2011, the Minister for UK Trade & Investment, Lord Green, opened Spirax Sarco's new facility in Saint Petersburg, Russia. During May 2012, the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg visited Spirax Sarco’s manufacturing facility in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. In May 2012, there was a shareholder revolt following Spirax-Sarco payment of £783,660 to a former executive director; the company compounded the situation by failing to inform the markets of the shareholder revolt as required by the Listing Rules. During November 2012, the company bought *Termodinámica*, a distributor based in Santiago de Chile, for £3.3 million. In February 2019, it acquired Thermocoax, a US based business involved in the manufacture and supply of mineral insulated cable.

In February 2024, the company announced its intention to rebrand as *Spirax Group*, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, the firm changed its name from Spirax-Sarco Engineering to Spirax Group on 3 June 2024.
