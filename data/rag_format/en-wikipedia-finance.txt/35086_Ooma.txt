# Ooma



**Ooma, Inc.** is an American publicly traded telecommunications company based in the Silicon Valley, California area. Ooma offers communications services including Voice over IP (VoIP) calling for business, home and mobile users.


## History

Ooma was founded by Andrew Frame, who previously worked for Cisco Systems, and Michael Cerda. Ooma's initial product was a "VoIP in a box" device that had the capability to use peer-to-peer VoIP technology to let users make phone calls over other Ooma users' landline services. The system worked through a "hub" connected to the main phone line and "scouts" connected to other phones. Due to the potential for privacy issues, Ooma never terminated any calls using the peer-to-peer technology. In January 2008, Ooma officially terminated the option of enabling its peer-to-peer technology.

*PC Magazine* awarded Ooma the DigitalLife Best of Show award in the hardware innovator category for the Ooma Hub in 2007. Frame stepped down from his role as CEO in 2009 and was replaced by Eric Stang. That same year, Ooma released its Telo system, which consisted of a base system to access unlimited calling and caller ID. In 2009, Ooma was awarded an Internet Telephony product of the year award for developing the Ooma Telo and the Ooma Telo handset. That same year, Ooma was given the TMC Labs Innovation Award for the Ooma Hub and Ooma Scout. Ooma received the gold consumer product of the year award as part of the Best in Biz Awards in 2011.

In 2011, it was announced that Ooma's VoIP-In-A-Box was expanding to Canada.

Ooma unveiled its HD2 handset in November 2012. The handset includes one-touch voicemail, an intercom, and baby monitoring features. Ooma also launched Ooma Linx in 2012, which used an AC outlet to connect any phone or fax machine to the Telo base station. In December 2012, Ooma received the Internet Telephony Product of the Year award for developing the Telo, HD2 handset, and Linx. Ooma launched the HD3 handset in December 2017 and the Ooma Telo 4G system with wireless internet connectivity in January 2019.

Ooma worked with West Valley City, Utah, in June 2014 to offer free telephone service to households through a fiber network. In 2015, Ooma was named one of the fastest-growing private companies by the *San Francisco Business Times* and *Silicon Valley Business Journal*. That same year, it was a gold winner of the Best of Biz Awards.

Ooma acquired security camera startup Butterfleye in December 2017, custom business communications provider Voxter in March 2018, business communications provider Broadsmart in May 2019 and business communications provider OnSIP in July 2022. On September 22, 2021, Ooma announced in an email message to its camera users that "We're sorry to inform you that the operation, maintenance and support of Ooma Butterfleye and Smart Cam security cameras will be ending. As such, the last day of operation of your camera(s) will be October 22, 2021. After this day, your camera(s) will stop working and will no longer record videos. Any videos you currently access through the Smart Cam App will become unavailable."

Ooma raised a $18.3 million Series D funding round in June 2009. Worldview Technology Partners led the round.

In January 2012, Ooma raised a funding round of $17.3 million from investors, including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Founder's Fund. The company had raised a total of $83.3 million at that time.

Ooma held its IPO in July 2015. The company went public at $13 per share. Ooma raised $85 million from the 5 million shares offered.
