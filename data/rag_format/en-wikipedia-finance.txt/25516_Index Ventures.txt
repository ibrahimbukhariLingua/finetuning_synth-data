## History

Index Ventures has its origins in a Swiss bond-trading firm called Index Securities, founded by Gerald Rimer in 1976. In 1992, Rimer recruited his son Neil to join the firm, launching a technology investment arm that evolved into Index Ventures.

Index Ventures was officially founded in 1996 by Neil Rimer, David Rimer and Giuseppe Zocco. It began investing in Israel in 2003, and by 2005 raised €300 million for its third fund. Two years later, it raised an additional €350 million for its fourth found, which focused 15 to 20 percent on investing in Israeli companies. The sixth fund raised €350 million from investors in 2012 and focused on investments in Europe, the U.S., and Israeli tech startups.

In 2017, it raised €400 million for its seventh fund, focusing on companies in Europe, the U.S., and Israel.

From early on, the firm launched a life sciences practice, which in 2016 it spun off as an independent venture capital firm, Medicxi Ventures. Index Ventures' dual headquarters in San Francisco and London were opened in 2011 and 2002, respectively.
