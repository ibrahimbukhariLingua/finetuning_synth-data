Event organisers expected a turnout of about 16,000 delegates and observers, but saw a record 23,000 delegates and 300 finance ministers registering themselves, the largest turnout for an overseas annual meeting. It is the largest meeting in Singapore's history, and other meetings include the 117th IOC Session and the WTO Ministerial Conference 1996. Main topics of discussion were the prospects of recession and the risk to the global economy. The primary outcome was reform of the IMF system.


## Preparations

On 30 September 2002, Lim Hng Kiang who was then the Second Minister for Finance, Minister for Health and the Deputy Chairman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore, announced Singapore as the host of the annual meetings for 2006. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed on 23 September 2003 at Dubai International Convention Centre by Lim, International Monetary Fund managing director Horst Köhler, and president of the World Bank Group James Wolfensohn.


### Venue and logistics

Pico Art International, a local event marketing corporation, was assigned to prepare the event venue. Pico had participated in major past events such as the 117th IOC Session, 2006 Commonwealth Games and the 2004 Summer Olympics. They built over a thousand double storey offices in 35 days, or three office units per hour. The structures within the convention centre were taken down nine days after the meetings. These double storey offices were air-conditioned, equipped with lighting, telephones and internet connection. It had 41 staircases and five elevators. One thousand tons of steel, over 100,000 pieces of wall panels, 25,000 m² of carpeting, 32,000 pieces of ceiling boards, 3,000 lights and 15,000 pieces of furniture were needed for the construction of these offices.

The main venue, Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre, received a facelift with an upgraded lobby, entrance and a facade which was lighted at night. 100,000 flowers and shrubs were used to beautify the landscape around the area as well as other parts of the island, including Orchard Road, Suntec's vicinity as well as the East Coast Parkway. These plants included frangipani trees, fox palms and heliconias, as well as other types of plants, coming in different colours, shapes and sizes, planted along pavements and road dividers. This showcased the tropical plants of the island to the world as well. Flyovers and the City Hall undergone repainting and works to repave the areas near Suntec City were pushed forward to prepare for the annual meetings. Also, walkways have been resurfaced by the Land Transport Authority. At Singapore Changi Airport, posters were put around the terminals of the airport to welcome the delegates from different countries.


### Publicity and logo

A campaign known as *Four Million Smiles* was launched in July 2006 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to prepare the service sector for the event. Lim Hwee Hwa is the minister appointed to lead the organising committee of the event.

The emblem for the 2006 annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group was a stylised golden bud. According to the event organisers, the color gold represented finance and the bud represented potential for growth.

## Activism and demonstrations

Singaporean authorities denied entry of several accredited civil service organisations (CSO) representatives whom they regarded as "troublemakers", despite appeals from the IMF and World Bank to permit them entry. On 11 September, when civic activists began arriving in Singapore, 28 activists were denied entry and had to leave the country. Police stated they had been denied entry for their involvement in previous violent protests. The IMF and World Bank stated that they had secured permission for accredited activists and protestors to attend the meetings, and they considered this denial a breach of that agreement. The convention's organising committee later condemned the restrictions as "authoritarian". Two unaccredited Filipino activists were deported on 13 September, and one Indian national was deported on 14 September. On 15 September 2006, part-way through the conference, the Singaporean government announced that 22 of the banned would be allowed entry. On 20 September, they stated that their changed stance had been a result of an internal review and was not a reaction to the IMF/World Bank criticism.

As with the Dubai 2003 meetings, outdoor demonstrations were not permitted, as they are illegal under Singaporean law. The government rejected requests to suspend the prohibitions for security reasons. Demonstrations from representatives of registered CSOs were granted permission to demonstrate in a small area on the ground floor of Suntec Singapore. Police pushed the start date of these demonstrations from 11 September to 13 September. The One Campaign in Singapore produced videos about world poverty and anticipated playing them at screens at the convention centre. An activist from Action Aid International held a solo protest on 14 September, and her group staged a silent protest the day after. Thirty people from Global Call to Action Against Poverty wore white t-shirts and gags with "no voice" written on them during a protest on 15 September. Some CSOs accused the IMF/World Bank of deliberately choosing Singapore to host the meetings because of its authoritarian reputation.

On 6 September 2006, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) announced plans for a protest on 16 September, called the Empower Singaporeans Rally and March. It would include members of the Singapore opposition including the SDP. On 11 September, it was reported that the police were investigating the planned rally. The police also reportedly denied two applications for the planned protest and confiscated leaflets about it that were handed out at Raffles City. The Rally began as planned at 11 am at the Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park, but was denied permission to travel to other planned stops at Parliament House, Suntec City, and the Istana. SDP member Chee Soon Juan gave a speech at the parkk. On 17 September, the protesters announced that they would continue their protest until the morning of 19 September, after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech before the WB-IMF meeting.

To circumvent the Singaporean ban, approximately 1,000 delegates from various organisations planned to hold outdoor demonstrations from 11–18 September in Batam, Indonesia. Indonesian law permits outdoor demonstration as long as authorities are informed three days in advance. Indonesian CSOs opposed the protests as they believed they would deter investment in the country. Indonesian authorities were reportedly not supportive of the planned demonstrations, and city police advised organisers that their demonstration would not be permitted for economic, political, and security reasons. On 11 September, Indonesian police granted a permit for a three-day indoor forum in Batam, but refused to allow outdoor demonstrations.


## Impact

A survey amongst delegates found a high satisfaction level with regards to the efficiency of event organisation, and of Singapore as a whole.
