## History


### Founding and launch (2021–present)

During March 2021, reports surfaced that Vinay Dube, the former CEO of Jet Airways and Go First, planned to launch a new low-cost carrier in India with former Go First Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), Praveen Iyer, and Head of Flight Operations, Nikhil Ved. The airline is a brand of SNV Aviation Private Limited.

In July 2021, the Indian billionaire trader, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, invested US$35 million for a 40% stake in the carrier. Aditya Ghosh owns 10% of the airline, while Vinay Dube owns 31% of it. Rakesh later increased his investment in the airline to 46%. It received a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Civil Aviation in October 2021.

On 22 December 2021, the airline unveiled its brand identity and logo, with the tagline *It's Your Sky*.

The symbol 'rising A', a part of their logo, was inspired by elements from the sky including the warmth of the rising sun, the effortless flight of a bird and the dependability of an aircraft wing. The colors of their brand 'Sunrise Orange' and 'Passionate Purple' were chosen, reflecting the airline's warm, youthful, and respectful nature. In early July 2022, the airline unveiled its crew uniform which was widely praised for its unique design. The uniform design incorporated a fusion of modern designs with Indian designs. It became the first airline to introduce sneakers made of recycled rubber, and the first in the country to introduce trainers for cabin crew as well.


#### Commencement of operations and operational difficulties

On 7 July 2022, the airline received its air operator's certificate (AOC) from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) after completing the required proving flights. On 22 July 2022, Akasa Air started Flight Booking on its website.

On 7 August 2022, the airline operated its first commercial flight between Mumbai and Ahmedabad with 28 flights per week. The inaugural event was heavily covered by mainstream media and the Indian aviation community. Notable aviation enthusiasts, youtubers and bloggers from across the globe and all over the country, like Josh Cahill, Sriram Hariharan, Utkarsh Thakkar, Dev Gandhi, and business magnate and the largest stakeholder of the airline, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, among many others flew on the inaugural flight. Initially, the airline operated flights with two Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with plans to add an aircraft every 2 weeks.

On 25 August 2022, the airline suffered a data breach. The airline on 28 August 2022 reported to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) that user information limited to names, gender, email addresses and phone numbers may have been viewed by unauthorized individuals; however, no travel-related information, travel records or payment information was compromised.

In September 2023, reports emerged that the airline had sent legal notice to over 19 pilots, who reportedly left the airline and joined Air India Express without completing their required 6 months notice. By the end of September, the number rose to over 40; the airline responded by stating that it was forced to cancel over 700 flights in August and more in September, so it faced operational losses and damage to its reputation. The airline was reportedly seeking that these pilots will return to the airline, complete their notice period and pay a set amount as compensation for the loss the airline had incurred. Air India Express, responded by stating that the pilots had fulfilled their obligation by paying a set bond amount to Akasa Air.

The airline received permission from the DGCA to operate international flights in December 2023, and announced in February 2024 that it would commence its international operations beginning from 28 March 2024, operating four weekly flights between Mumbai and Doha, with flights to Dammam and Riyadh starting in the coming months.
