## History

For more than 100 years, Repower has been one of the largest providers of electricity in Switzerland. Founded in 1904 as *Kraftwerke Brusio AG*, the same year the company started construction of its first power plant − at the time the largest high-pressure hydropower installation in Europe − in Campocologno in the Poschiavo region of Canton Graubünden, Switzerland. Proximity to the Italian border precipitated the company's involvement in international projects and business activities. In 2000, Kraftwerke Brusio AG (Poschiavo), *AG Bündner Kraftwerke* (Klosters) and *Rhätische Werke für Elektrizität AG* (Thusis) merged to create the *Rätia Energie AG* group, which was subsequently joined by *aurax ag* (Ilanz) in 2004. In 2002 the group embarked on business in Italy. In 2010, Rätia Energie AG was renamed Repower AG.
