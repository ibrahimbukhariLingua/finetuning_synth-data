Squawk on the Street


# Squawk on the Street



***Squawk on the Street***, which debuted on December 19, 2005, is a business show on CNBC that follows the first 90 minutes of trading on Wall Street in the United States.

Originally airing as a one-hour program, the show doubled its airtime to two hours on July 19, 2007 (due in part to Liz Claman's departure from the network). This replaced the first hour of *Morning Call* (later renamed *The Call* on August 8, 2007), which aired one hour later and had its airtime reduced in half. On October 17, 2011, *Squawk on the Street* was expanded to 3 hours, from 9 am to noon ET. *The Call* was canceled as a result of this program's expansion. On May 19, 2014, *Squawk on the Street* reverted to 2 hours (9 am to 11 am ET) as a new program, *Squawk Alley*, debuted on that day. On February 27, 2023, *Squawk on the Street* once again expanded to three hours, with the third hour replacing the cancelled *TechCheck* but reverted back to being a two-hour show on December 11, 2023, following the debut of a new 11 am show, *Money Movers*.


## About the show

*Squawk on the Street*, which is seen at 9:00am ET, is broadcast live at the New York Stock Exchange. Mark Haines and Erin Burnett were the original co-anchors at the NYSE. Haines (the original host of *Squawk Box*), died on May 24, 2011, 18 days after Burnett left CNBC (May 6, 2011) to host CNN's *Outfront* (see below Mark Haines). David Faber (who also hosts and contributes to his "Faber Report" segments) originally reported from CNBC Global Headquarters, while Haines and Burnett were in the "Squawk Nest," or "Luxury Box" (as Haines called it) above the NYSE. Contributors include Bob Pisani (NYSE), Bertha Coombs and Scott Wapner. Coombs and Wapner were the original NASDAQ contributors, Wapner left the show in 2010 focusing to host on *Fast Money Halftime Report* and was replaced by Seema Mody. Leaving Coombs remained in that report along with Mody, were Sharon Epperson (NYMEX) and Rick Santelli (CME Group).

On July 11, 2011, *Squawk on the Street* debuted an entirely new anchor team at the NYSE. Carl Quintanilla (previously co-anchor of *Squawk Box*), Melissa Lee (anchor of *Fast Money* and *Options Action*) and Simon Hobbs (previously a presenter on CNBC Europe) were appointed as the new anchor team. *Mad Money* host Jim Cramer joined Quintanilla and Lee as a contributor for the first hour, with Hobbs joining Quintanilla and Lee as a third anchor for the duration. The following year (2012), Faber was moved from the network's Englewood Cliffs studio to a new trading-floor studio set (which replaced the old above-the-floor set that had been used since 2005) at the NYSE. The trading-floor studio set located in Post 9 at the NYSE, which debuted in 2012, is shared with *Squawk Alley* (later *TechCheck*) and *Closing Bell*.

On April 1, 2013, Lee was removed from her anchoring duties on *Squawk on the Street* and continues on as anchor of *Fast Money* and *Options Action*. On May 17, 2013, Kelly Evans (previously the co-anchor of *Worldwide Exchange*, which was originally based in CNBC Europe's headquarters at Fleet Place in London; then at the time, co-anchor of *Closing Bell*), became the new co-anchor of *Squawk on the Street*, her assignment began three days later. Evans officially left her anchoring duties to *Closing Bell* at the end of 2013 and was replaced by Sara Eisen, who was previously had a contributing role. Sara became a permanent co-anchor in May 2014.

On October 13, 2014, *Squawk on the Street*, along with CNBC's other trading-day programs, launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation on that same day.

From November 29, 2018 to February 17, 2023, Sara Eisen anchored *Closing Bell*, originally co-anchored along with Wilfred Frost until his departure from CNBC on February 16, 2022. Eisen had previously co-anchored *Worldwide Exchange* (also alongside Frost), from January 4, 2016 through March 9, 2018 and after that, *Power Lunch* from March 12, 2018 to November 28, 2018. Her position as co-anchor on *Squawk on the Street* was replaced by Morgan Brennan (formerly of *Squawk Alley*) on June 22, 2020. She returned to *Squawk on the Street* as co-anchor on February 21, 2023.

## Program format

The show begins with the co-anchors and Jim Cramer on the floor of the NYSE, and "The Rundown" segment, starting with Bob Pisani on the floor at the NYSE. The other market pre-open segments include the "Word on the Street" segment, in which either the co-anchors talk to a trader on the floor of the NYSE, and "Instant Analysis," in which either Quintanilla or Faber (or both) talk to an analyst either via satellite or on set.

Around the midway point of the show's first hour was originally the "Opening Bell Countdown," which had a countdown clock on the lower right of the screen. However, since Cramer joined *Squawk on the Street* in July 2011, the "Opening Bell Countdown" segment has been replaced with "Cramer's Mad Dash." After the opening bells ring at the NYSE and NASDAQ MarketSite, Quintanilla, Cramer and Faber send viewers through the opening minutes of the trading day with the "Opening Buzz" segment (see below). The show originally ended with the anchors looking at the "Stocks to Watch."
