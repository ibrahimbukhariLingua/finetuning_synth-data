## Career


### Lehman Brothers 1991-2011

He began his career at Lehman Brothers in 1991, where he spent 18 years in roles including Co-Head of the Global Media Group and Head of Asia-Pacific Investment Banking. In these positions, Schiffman helped build the M&A business, leading it to win a number of awards, including FinanceAsia's Momentum House of the Year for 2007 and the number one position in completed M&A deals for 2008.

During his tenure at Lehman Brothers, Schiffman was credited with executing deals in excess of $100 billion. Schiffman was involved in the sale of Lehman's Asian Business to Nomura in September 2008. Schiffman later served as Head of Investment Banking Asia-Pacific and was promoted to Head of Investment Banking for the Americas and CEO of Nomura Securities North America in 2010.

From 2011-2013, Schiffman was a Partner at The Raine Group before becoming a Senior Managing Director at Guggenheim Securities from 2013-2016.


### IAC 2016-2020

In 2016, Schiffman joined IAC as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. IAC CEO Joey Levin praised Schiffman's leadership skills and experience upon his appointment.

In 2018, *The Wall Street Journal* discussed Schiffman's capital allocation strategy at IAC, noting its alignment with a broader trend among global companies to sell assets to focus on stronger areas of business. A profile of Schiffman in CFO Magazine on May 24, 2018, detailed his approach to investor relations and disciplined financial management with a focus on “compounding capital over the long term,” and in an interview with CFO Thought Leader in November 2018, Schiffman reflected on his past experiences and how he learned to "separate the urgent from the important."

In a CFO Insights column with Forbes on January 11, 2019, Schiffman explained the importance of balancing short-term success and long-term growth by working closely with brand executives.

In June 2019, he published a column in CFO Magazine describing the importance of a detailed, rigorous approach to capital allocation in order to win superior returns. Schiffman explained how IAC allocates capital toward three pursuits: (1) investing in our existing businesses; (2) acquisitions; and (3) share repurchases and dividends.

In June 2021, Jefferies Analyst Brent Thill published a report following IAC's announcement of Glenn's departure as CFO, which noted that IAC stock had outperformed during his tenure and that this announcement would serve as a near-term headwind for the rapid growth pace the company experienced on his watch. Thill said, "Glenn's departure will certainly sting as IAC loses one of the best CFOs in the internet sector. Glenn has been one of the most respected CFOs in the industry and has been a clear and straightforward leader, helping to create strong shareholder value for IAC investors. We highlight that during his 5-year tenure as CFO, IAC's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500."


### CFO of Fanatics 2021

In July 2021, it was announced that Schiffman would take over as CFO of Fanatics. At Fanatics, Schiffman is responsible for overseeing the company's financial operations as it expands into new business areas outside of merchandise.

In May 2024, Schiffman appeared on The Modern CFO podcast to discuss the force multipliers fueling Fanatics' success and shared advice for aspiring finance leaders.
