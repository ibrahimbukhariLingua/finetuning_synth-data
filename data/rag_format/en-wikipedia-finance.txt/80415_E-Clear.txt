## History

The company was formed in 2002.

In 2007, Deutsche Bank announced the end of its agreement for card processing with E-Clear. As a result, E-Clear began buying shares in NordFinanz, a small loss-making bank in Bremen. By 2009, E-Clear owned 97% of the shares in the bank. In 2010, it sold the stake.

In January 2010, the company was put into administration.
