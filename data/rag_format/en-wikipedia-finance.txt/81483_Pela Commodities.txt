## Overview

In 2021, a group of four entrepreneurs decided to establish an agro-processing plant in the city of Soroti, in Uganda's Eastern Region. The factory was constructed on land availed by the Uganda Investment Authority, in Arapai Industrial Park, on the outskirts of Soroti. One of the four investors is Amos Wekesa, whose primarily investments are in Uganda's hospitality industry. Soroti was selected because grains are extensively grown in the Teso sub-region and the city is within easy accessibility of the two major markets of Kenya and South Sudan.

The factory is capable of cleaning, sorting, drying and packaging up to 56 different types of grain. At maximum utilization, it is expected to process up to 600 metric tonnes of grain in 24 hours.
