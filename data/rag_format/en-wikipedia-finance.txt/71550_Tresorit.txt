## History

Tresorit was founded in 2011 by Istvan Lam, Szilveszter Szebeni and Gyorgy Szilagyi with the aim of providing a secure alternative to traditional cloud storage solutions. In the coming years, Andrea Skaliczki joined as CFO, Istvan Hartung as CTO. The company officially launched its client-side encrypted cloud storage service after emerging from its stealth beta version in April 2014.

In 2013 and 2014, Tresorit hosted a hacking contest offering $10,000 to anyone who hacked their data encryption methods to gain access to their servers. After some months, the reward was increased to $25,000 and later to $50,000, challenging experts from institutions like Harvard, Stanford or MIT. The contest ran for 468 days and according to the company, nobody was able to break the encryption.

In August 2015, Wuala (owned by LaCie and Seagate), a pioneer of secure cloud storage, announced it was closing its service after 7 years and recommended its users choose Tresorit as their secure cloud alternative.

In 2016, Tresorit launched its NGO initiative with the aim of improving the digital security of non-profits and has gained notable recognition within the sector where the protection of sensitive information is paramount. More than 500 teams (human rights defenders, environmental activists, teams working on education and research, and many others from all over the world) joined Tresorit’s NGO program since then.

In 2017, Tresorit patented its shareable encryption technology in the US under no. US 9563783 B2, and LogMeIn co-founder Marton Anka joined Tresorit as an investor and advisor.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In July 2021, Tresorit was acquired by the Swiss Post to further expand its presence in its core German-speaking markets, including Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

## Technology

Tresorit uses AES 256 encryption. With Tresorit's end-to-end encryption, every file and relevant metadata on user devices are encrypted with unique, randomly generated encryption keys. These keys are never sent to Tresorit's servers in an unencrypted format. Accessing files is only possible with a user's unique private decryption key.

Tresorit uses random keys for each file and random IVs for each version of a file. The company claims that two identical files look completely different after encryption, thus they cannot be compared or matched.

Tresorit provides client side zero-knowledge encryption, across all platforms, even from web browsers. This ensures that no keys, passwords, files or any sensitive material ever get transferred in an unencrypted or reversible form. Encryption keys or unencrypted files are never visible to the servers or Tresorit administrators. Due to this zero-knowledge system, Tresorit does not even store passwords. Administrators of a business Tresorit account can reset user passwords, if the business has the feature "Advanced Control" turned on. This design enhances user privacy and security.
