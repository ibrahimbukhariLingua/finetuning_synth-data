## History

In 2013, the Swiss investment firm Partners Group made an equity investment in the company.

In November 2013, the company acquired Bannockburn, Illinois-based venue security company IPC International, at the time the company's largest acquisition.

By 2015, the company was operating as a division of Universal Services of America. In February, Robert Stone, a former employee of Universal Protection Service filed an arbitration claim alleging that the company failed to pay overtime wages for all hours worked as well as minimum wage. Stone also asserted claims of additional wage violations including meal period and rest period violations, allegedly in violation of California and federal wage law. The company denied the allegations, but entered into a $30 million settlement to avoid the cost of litigation. The settlement was granted preliminary approval on November 22, 2017. In July 2015, Universal Services of America received an ownership investment from investment firm Warburg Pincus, joining earlier owner investment firm Partners Group. Also in July, parent Universal Services acquired Memphis, Tennessee-based security firm Guardsmark, and became the largest privately owned security contractor in the US. Guardsmark's founder, Ira A. Lipman, joined UPS's board as vice chairman.

In 2016, Universal Services of America merged with fellow security services firm AlliedBarton to form Allied Universal. In February 2017, the company officially began operations under its new name.
