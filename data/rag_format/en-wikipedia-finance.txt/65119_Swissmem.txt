Swissmem


# Swissmem



**Swissmem** is the association for Switzerland's mechanical and electrical engineering industries (MEM industries) and related technology-oriented sectors. It represents the interests of the MEM industries in the commercial, political and public spheres, and boosts the competitive capacity of its 1,250 or so member companies with needs-based services. These include training and development courses for employees in the sector, consulting services, networks and a compensation fund.

Martin Hirzel has been President of Swissmem since 2021. Stefan Brupbacher has been its CEO since 2019.

Swissmem is headquartered in Zurich.


## History

The history of Swissmem began in 1883 with the founding of the Swiss Association of Machinery Manufacturers (VSM). The Association’s goal was: “To safeguard and promote the general interests of the Swiss engineering industry”. Consequently, the engineering industry employers established the Association of Swiss Engineering Employers (ASM) from the ranks of the VSM in 1905. The ASM’s purpose was to safeguard its members’ interests in the area of social policy. Both associations have been operating under the Swissmem name since 1999.

In September 2006, the ASM and VSM members voted in favour of continuing integration. In early 2007, the VSM became Swissmem and took on all of the ASM’s activities except those relating to the sector’s collective employment agreement (GAV). The ASM continues to exist legally as an independent organization and is a contractual partner in the collective employment agreement for the Swiss MEM industries. The MEM industries’ GAV traditionally blazes a trail for many other Swiss GAVs and has evolved from the “industrial peace agreement” of 1937 to the high-level agreement of today.


## Members

More than 1,250 companies are members of Swissmem. They include ABB, Bucher, Bühler, Geberit, Georg Fischer, Pilatus, Rieter, Schindler, Siemens, Stadler and many more. 85% of all Swissmem members are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

With around 320,000 employees, including more than 15,000 apprentices, the MEM industries are among the biggest employers in Switzerland. They generate total annual sales of CHF 79.9 billion (2020). This equates to around 7% (2020) of GDP. The MEM industries thus occupy a key position within the Swiss economy. The sector accounts for almost a third of Switzerland’s total goods exports, with a value of CHF 60.7 billion (2020).

### Social partnership

In 1937, the ASM and the trade unions concluded the first collective employment agreement, or GAV, for the Swiss MEM industries. Since then, this agreement has formed the core element of the social partnership and is renegotiated once every five years. The current GAV has been in force since 2018. The contractual partners on the employees’ side are Employees Switzerland, Kaufmännischer Verband Schweiz, SKO, SYNA and Unia.
