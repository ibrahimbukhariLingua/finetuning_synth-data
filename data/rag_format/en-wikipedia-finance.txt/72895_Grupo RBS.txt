## Institutional campaigns

Institutional campaigns are one of Grupo RBS' most traditional actions and one of its most important social investment traditions. Entirely nonprofit and noncommercial, the social awareness campaigns involve all of the company's multimedia platforms, as well as its co-workers, and include branches such as editorial (news broadcast/published by the group's media outlets), advertising (advertisements carried on all media), and institutional (mobilization actions alongside government and community agents).

In recent years, RBS has raised its voice on a variety of issues such as road safety, child protection and crack cocaine abuse prevention. These campaigns have achieved countless results, among which are the establishment of a Child and Youth Debate Day; a partnership with the National Justice Council for the country-wide airing of the *Crack, Nem Pensar* ('Don't Even Think About Crack') campaign in 2011 (drug abuse prevention campaign); and the establishment of the *Crack, Nem Pensar* Institute (the 'Don't Even Think About Crack Institute'), based in Porto Alegre.


### 'Love is the Best Inheritance, Take Care of the Kids'

The campaign *O Amor é a Melhor Herança, Cuide das Crianças* ('Love is the Best Inheritance, Take Care of the Kids') was launched in June 2003, intended to highlight the importance of societal care for children and teens. The campaign also featured five friendly monsters and her cubs: the Devil, the Bogeyman, the Witch, the Headless Mule and the Black Face Ox. At the end of 2003 the sixth monster joined, the Bad Wolf with its pups.


### 'Education Needs Answers'

The campaign *A Educação Precisa de Respostas* ('Education Needs Answers') was launched in 2012 as a broad awareness campaign. Led by Grupo RBS, it aims to bring forward discussion groups and the search for solutions to raise the level of primary education across Brazil, especially within the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. The campaign was a three-part partnership with *Fundação Maurício Sirotsky Sobrinho* (FMSS) (editorial, advertising and institutional). It also makes education the main focus of Grupo RBS' social investment, reinforcing the company's focus on ongoing community development.

Grupo RBS' educational campaign will take on a new phase in 2013. Education-related subjects will continue to be featured in RBS' media outlets while new institutional actions will promote more community-based engagement throughout the year.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ
