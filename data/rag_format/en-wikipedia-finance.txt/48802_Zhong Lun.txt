## History

Zhong Lun was founded in Beijing in 1993 as a private partnership. In 1996, it merged with the Beijing-based law firm Jintong and changed its name to Zhonglun Jintong. In 2003, a group of Zhonglun Jintong partners left to set up a new firm named Zhonglun W&D. Zhonglun Jintong rebranded itself as Zhong Lun in 2008.

Zhong Lun's office in Wuhan was opened in January 2010. Zhong Lun's office in Hong Kong was opened in February 2010, in an association with the Hong Kong–based law firm Roger Ho & Co. In 2011 Zhong Lun's Hong Kong office merged with the Hong Kong–based law firm Boughton Peterson Yang Anderson. Zhong Lun's opened an office in London in February 2012 following the recruitment of the entire London staff of Zhonglun W&D.
