Employee Confidence Index


# Employee Confidence Index



The **Employee Confidence Index** is a measure of employees’ overall confidence in the economy, their employer, and their ability to find other employment. The Index, like other employee confidence studies, is designed to show how the supply and demand of labour in various industries effects employee confidence and satisfaction. Currently, the Employee Confidence Index is only published in the United States using data collected from American citizens.


## History

The Employee Confidence Index was created in 2004 by Randstad NV. Presently, the Index offers a comprehensive look at the confidence of employees in eight industries including Finance, Engineering, Healthcare, and Human Resources.

Other private firms and public organizations assemble and analyze data to produce summaries of employee confidence. Glassdoor, a career community site, publishes a Quarterly Employment Confidence Survey which takes into account educational qualifications and standard industry salaries. Glassdoor, Randstad, and other industry experts tend to focus the scope of their surveys around different objectives. The resulting patchwork creates challenges for researchers looking to make comparisons across industries or data sets despite most of the information being collected and analyzed by the same survey companies.

Another related and widely cited type of confidence index published in the United States is the Consumer Confidence Index. Published by the Conference Board, this index gathers information on how consumers view the economy, labour market, future earnings potential, and current business conditions. The index also tracks how difficult finding a job is, and the likelihood of families making large purchasing decisions in the coming months.

Studies designed to measure employee confidence focus primarily on how employees feel about their current employers, while studies on consumer confidence focus on spending decisions. Despite the different foundations, there is overlap between the two formats, primarily because a worker’s confidence in his or her income drives his or her spending decisions. The overlap between the employee focused indexes and the consumer focused indexes allows for detailed analysis.

The survey company used by both Randstad and Glassdoor for the Employee Confidence Index, and the Quarterly Employment Confidence Survey industry analysis is Harris Interactive. The Conference Board uses Harris Interactive's parent company Neilson to collect and analyze the data for the Consumer Confidence Index.
