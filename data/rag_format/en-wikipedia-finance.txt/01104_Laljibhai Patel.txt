## Social work

Laljibhai Patel has supported multiple social initiatives, focusing on preventing female foeticide, promoting water conservation, improving education, enhancing healthcare services, and tackling social illiteracy.


### Save the Girl Child Mega Campaign

Under Patel's presidency, the Samast Patidar Samaj launched the "Save the Girl Child Mega Campaign" (Maha Laddu Beti Bachao Abhiyan) to combat female foeticide and promote gender equality. The campaign involved collecting grain and water from 235,000 households to create a large *Boondi laddu*.

The distribution of informative booklets and a large gathering in Surat in 2006, where 1.2 million people pledged to oppose female foeticide, were part of this initiative, recognized by the Limca Book of Records. The campaign's impact on Gujarat's gender ratio is claimed to have been significant.
