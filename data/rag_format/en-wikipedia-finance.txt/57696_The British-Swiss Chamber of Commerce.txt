# The British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce



**The British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce (BSCC)** is an independent not-for-profit organisation founded in 1920 with more than 500 members. It aims to improve business relations between Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the UK. The BSCC is a forum for debate and networking. The BSCC is composed of corporate, SME, and individual members, who are categorized into four groups, called network, promote, lead, and influence. BSCC members represent the majority of business sectors. Its activities include organising events, providing advisory services and creating a platform for the exchange of information and experience between Switzerland and the UK.

The BSCC is also divided into geographical chapters. These are active in Basel, Bern, Central Switzerland, Geneva, Liechtenstein, Ticino, the United Kingdom, and ZÃ¼rich. The BSCC has special interest groups covering public affairs, legal, and tax. The BSCC also provides training, workshops, and panel discussions.


## Foundation and development

The British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce (BSCC) was founded in Bern on 14 July 1920. It was founded when economic relations between Switzerland and the United Kingdom intensified. The Chamber was created in response to growing trade relations and the need for institutionalised support for businesses in both countries. Two years after its foundation, the BSCC had 320 members. This indicates an interest in supporting bilateral trade between Switzerland and the UK. The organisation was a platform for exchanging information and resources between companies from both countries. In the decades following its foundation, the BSCC was involved in the promotion of trade relations between Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It offered its members advisory services, networking events and information on market opportunities and regulatory developments in both countries. The organisation worked to reduce trade barriers and strengthen bilateral economic relations. Over the years, the BSCC has had to adapt to various political and economic changes, including the impact of the Second World War and the various stages of European integration. Despite these challenges, the Chamber has remained a stable factor in supporting economic relations between the two countries.


## Aims and objectives

A primary objective of the British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce (BSCC) is to promote trade and investment between the two countries. This includes supporting companies in developing new markets and facilitating access to existing markets. The Chamber works to identify and remove trade barriers and provides key market information and advisory services to its members.

The BSCC regularly organises events aimed at creating and strengthening networks between business people from both countries. These events provide platforms for the exchange of best practices, the discussion of current economic and political issues and the promotion of business opportunities. The Chamber organises around 30 such events each year, covering a wide range of topics relevant to the Anglo-Swiss business community.

The BSCC supports its members in regulatory and market-specific matters. This includes providing information on legal and tax changes that may affect companies doing business in or with the other country. The organisation works with governments and other relevant institutions to consider the interests of its members.

A recent example of the BSCC's efforts is the promotion of mutual recognition of financial services between Switzerland and the UK. This commitment aims to facilitate market access for banks, insurance companies and other financial service providers. The Chamber supports the development of a framework that enables easy and efficient cross-border business.

The BSCC places great emphasis on educating and informing its members through seminars, workshops and information materials. These resources help members make informed decisions and adapt their business strategies in line with developments in the bilateral relationship. As an important voice for the business communities of both countries, the BSCC promotes the interests of its members at a political and economic level. It represents these interests to governments and international organisations to promote and maintain a favourable business environment.
