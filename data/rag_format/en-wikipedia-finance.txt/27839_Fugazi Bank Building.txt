## History

The Fugazi Bank Building was designed by architect Charles Peter Paff (1865–1942) and was originally flat-iron-shaped and standing at two stories, with a cupola at its sharp point, but the cupola was removed, and a third story was later added. The building has a white terra cotta-cladding.

The building was a design reference point for the Reid & Reids' Colombo Building (1913; also known as the Drexler-Colombo Building), located nearby at 1 Columbus Avenue, with a mirroring building shape. These two buildings together frame the gateway to Columbus Avenue and the North Beach neighborhood.

Giovanni "John" Fugazi (1838–1916) originally built the structure in 1909 to hold the Banca Popolare Operaia Italiana Popular Italiana Bank. A.P. Giannini had been a member of the Fugazi Bank's board of directors early in his career and before founding the Bank of Italy. He later purchased the building, which served as the headquarters of his Transamerica Corporation (founded in 1928). Since November 2003, the building has been owned by the Church of Scientology.
