## History

Forthnet was established in October 1995 by Minoan Lines SA and the Foundation for Research & Technology – Hellas.

Nova brand was launched in Greece in December 1999 for the satellite television platform by Naspers, a South African company, who also operated MultiChoice. In 2002, Nova absorbed the Alpha Digital satellite television platform. On April 14, 2008, Forthnet reached an agreement with Naspers to purchase Netmed, the parent company of Nova satellite television platform in Greece and Cyprus for €430 million.

In 2010, Nova Greece had 363,679 subscribers. HD service counted 52,968 subscribers in 2011.

In the end June 2015 the platform had 509,088 subscribers, while one year later, June 2016 it had a decrease to 460,252.

In July 2017, it was referred that Nova had 430,000 subscribers.

In 2020, Nova had 551,000 broadband internet subscribers and 457,000 pay television subscribers.

In March 2021, it was announced that Nova had 456,500 pay television subscribers making it the second largest TV provider.


## Satellite Technical information

Nova broadcasts in standard definition using the DVB-S MPEG-2 format and (since September 2010) in high definition using the DVB-S MPEG-4 format through Hot Bird 8 satellite at 13°E. The service is encrypted with Irdeto conditional access system. Until recently the subscribers had the option of buying a specific set-top box, or using any DVB-S Irdeto enabled set-top box, but since September 2009 new subscribers are only allowed to use the company's own set-top box. This change of policy has raised some significant controversy. Nova has also introduced a digital video service, accessible only through a (different) specific set-top box. This service requires an extra subscription fee but also provides the subscriber with the option to watch two different channels on two different TV sets in the same household.
