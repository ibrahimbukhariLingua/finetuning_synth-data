Freakonomics Radio


# Freakonomics Radio



***Freakonomics Radio*** is an American public radio program and podcast network which discusses socioeconomic issues for a general audience. While the network, as of 2023, includes five programs, the primary podcast is also named Freakonomics and is a spin-off of the 2005 book *Freakonomics*. Journalist Stephen Dubner hosts the show, with economist Steven Levitt as a regular guest, both of whom co-wrote the book of the same name. The show is primarily distributed as a podcast, and is among the most popular on iTunes.


## History

*Freakonomics Radio* was created in September 2010. Starting in July 2018, production moved from WNYC to Stitcher Radio; *Freakonomics Radio* is released at 11 p.m. on Wednesday each week on podcast aggregators such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, as well as on the Freakonomics website.

From November 16, 2016, until November 12, 2017, Freakonomics Radio produced episodes of “live journalism wrapped in a game show” called *Tell Me Something I Don’t Know*.

In November 2022, the Freakonomics podcast looked at whether Google searches were getting worse. The episode featured former Google executive Marissa Mayer.

In February 2023, Freakonomics Radio Network announced a deal with YouTube to bring its podcasts to the video platform.
