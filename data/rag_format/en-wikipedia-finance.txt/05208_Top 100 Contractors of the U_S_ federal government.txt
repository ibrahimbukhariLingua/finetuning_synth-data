Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government


# Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government



The **Top 100 Contractors Report** (**TCR 100**) is a list developed annually by the General Services Administration as part of its tracking of U.S. federal government procurement. It features the "Top 100" contractors with the U.S. government.

In 2005, the federal government aimed to source 23% of all subcontracts from small businesses with guidance from the Small Business Administration. The federal government was unable to meet this goal in 8 years until FY2013 when it subcontracted over $83 billion from small businesses.

In 2015, the federal government exceeded their overall goal of 23% by 2.75% resulting in $90.7 billion dollars awarded to small businesses, 5.05% ($17.8 billion) of which went to women-owned small business (WOSB), meeting the goal for the first time since it was implemented in 1996.

The top five departments by dollars obligated in 2015 were the Department of Defense ($212.5 billion), Department of Energy ($23 billion), Health and Human Services ($21 billion), Department of Veteran Affairs ($20 billion), and NASA ($13 billion).
