Seatwave


# Seatwave



**Seatwave** was an online ticket marketplace for buying and selling tickets to music, sporting and cultural events. Seatwave was founded in May 2006. Ticket sellers used to be able to list their tickets on Seatwave and specify what price they would be willing to sell them for. Buyers could browse the site, compare ticket prices and could then purchase the ticket they feel was the best deal.

Seatwave's TicketIntegrity guarantee ensured buyers that would get the tickets they ordered by the day of the event. If they didn't, Seatwave would find them replacement tickets, or refund the buyer.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 13 August 2018, Seatwave parent company Ticketmaster Ltd announced its intention to close Seatwave in October 2018, and move secondary ticketing services to its main website, in a bid to combat exploitation of the service by ticket touts.

On 27 November 2018, Seatwave was closed, no longer accepting new ticket listings or purchases. The company is currently closed down, and has yet to announce a reopening date.

To prevent football hooliganism, the resale of football tickets in the UK was made illegal within the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. Resale of football tickets is only legal when expressly permitted by the individual club. As of 2011, Seatwave is the approved secondary ticket partner of Fulham FC.

Seatwave has partnered with Grand Union Management who manage artists including The Enemy and Reverend and the Makers.


### Testimony at 2007 Parliamentary enquiry

In 2007, the UK's Department for Culture, Media and Sport appointed a Select Committee to investigate ticket touting and outline recommendations on legislative measures. On 10 January 2008, the Select Committee published a report which summarised their findings. They identified 12 key benefits and 14 key detriments for consumers. Seatwave testified at the inquiry where Joe Cohen presented his view on touting.

In April 2008, the government responded to the Select Committee's reports supporting the findings that legislation should be a last resort, identifying a need for the primary ticketing market to be improved and urging all players in the industry to work together to develop a voluntary code of principles. Seatwave has declined to join any trade association connected with secondary ticketing in Europe, citing fundamental differences.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
