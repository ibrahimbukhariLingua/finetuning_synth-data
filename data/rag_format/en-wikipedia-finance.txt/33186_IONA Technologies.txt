IONA Technologies


# IONA Technologies



**IONA Technologies, Inc.** was an Irish software company founded in 1991. It began as a campus company linked to Trinity College Dublin had its headquarters in Dublin, and eventually also expanded its offices in Boston and Tokyo. It specialised in distributed service-oriented architecture (SOA) technology, its products connecting systems and applications by creating a network of services without requiring a centralised server or creating an information technology project. IONA was the first Irish company to float on the NASDAQ exchange. It was valued at up to US$1.75 billion at its peak. It was one of the world's 10 largest software-only companies, and around 30 new ventures spun out from it. IONA was sold to Progress Software in 2008.


## History

In 1981, a Trinity College Dublin PhD student, Chris Horn, visited Stanford University, and met Andy Bechtolsheim, inventor of the Stanford University Network (SUN) workstation, and Bill Joy, and when they later went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, he began to talk to fellow academics about starting their own venture. Eventually, in 1991, IONA Technologies, was founded by Horn and fellow TCD academics Sean Baker and Annrai O’Toole, each of the three putting in 1,000 Irish pounds for starting capital. IONA received limited support from Trinity College, including an office with a desk and phone in a TCD innovation centre on Westland Row.


## Leadership

Horn was the first CEO and later also lead architect and developer for the *Orbix* product, launched in 1992. The firm was strategically focused on object-oriented middleware software, but initially produced training, device drivers and ran backups. IONA found the Irish market (business expansion schemes, banks, venture capital firms) unwilling to invest, secured some IDA Ireland support, grew. After showcasing their first product in the US in 1992, they secured a minority investment from Sun Microsystems in December 1993, 600,000 US dollars for 25% of the equity.

Despite having just 11 staff, they then sold a multi-national network management system to Motorola, and then a solution to Boeing, and were able to become the first Irish company to float on the NASDAQ, achieving the fifth largest debut on that exchange to date.

At peak the company reached a market valuation of US$1.75 billion. Horn stepped down from the CEO role in 2000, but remained as a non-executive director; he returned to the CEO role from 2003 to 2005, after the "dotcom crash".

On 25 June 2008 it was announced that IONA would be acquired by Progress Software for about $162 million, the deal closing shortly thereafter. Over its lifetime, about 30 new companies had spun out from IONA.

On 24 December 2012 Progress Software sold the IONA-related Orbix, Orbacus and Artix software product lines to Micro Focus International plc for $15 million.

The open-source group was later spun out into its own entity, FuseSource Corp, which was acquired by Red Hat in 2012. This group consisted of individuals and technologies involved in the various open-source projects and communities, including those that joined as part of the acquisition of LogicBlaze.
