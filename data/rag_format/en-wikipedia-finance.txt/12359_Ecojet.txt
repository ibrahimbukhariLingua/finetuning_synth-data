# Ecojet



**Ecojet Airlines Limited,** styled as **ecojet**, is a proposed British regional airline based at Edinburgh Airport, Scotland. It aims to commence operations in 2025 with flights to and from Edinburgh Airport.


## History


### Founding

On 17 July 2023, reports emerged that Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity and a prominent climate change activist, had formed a new company by the name of Ecojet, which planned to become the world's first electric airline using a fleet of aircraft powered by renewable energy. The airline had appointed Brent Smith, a former Flybe pilot and the founder of Q400 specialist Altsel Aviation, as its Chief Executive alongside Peter Davies, the former Chief Executive of companies including Brussels Airlines, Air Malta, and Air Southwest, who is also the founder and CEO of Airline Management Group, as its chairman.

Ecojet Airlines Limited was founded on 27 August 2021 as Fresh Airlines Limited, and this name was changed on 2 May 2023 following Dale Vince's appointment as a director.

On 26 January 2024, Ecojet began hiring for crew based in Edinburgh, to operate a fleet of ATR 72 airliners. The same month, the airline made a CAMO application to the UK's Civil Aviation Authority.

On September 23rd, 2024, the airline announced that its operations are now slated to begin in early 2025, with CEO Brent Smith saying that, "It’s taking time because we want to get it right from the very outset."

The airline expects details of its IATA designator codes and callsign to be confirmed shortly.

In October 2024, Ecotricity took over Vince's shareholding in Ecojet.

On November 31th, 2024, Ecojet appointed Wyvern Partners as its financial advisor in order to lead a £20 million fundraising effort in order to satisfy CAA capital requirements for the AOC application process.


### Launch of operations

In January 2025, the airline published its website in preparation for an operational launch during the IATA 2025 summer season.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Management team

On 9 December 2023, it was reported that Ecojet had made further appointments to its management team. These appointments included Deon van Rensburg as its Head of Finance, Ben Leon as its Chief Commercial Officer and Augusto Ponte as an advisor to the board of directors. Furthermore, it was officially confirmed that Brent Smith is to take on the role of chief executive officer.

On 8 March 2024, Ecojet announced the appointment of Rebecca Borresen as its Chief Operating Officer, though she would later resign in favour of a position at Loganair.


### Proposed operations

The airline has said that it hopes to eliminate single-use plastics from its services, and will also serve plant-based meals and provide crew with sustainable uniforms. Whilst initially it will use traditional kerosene-fuelled aircraft, it plans to shift to electric aircraft once it has begun operations and received its operating licences and airport slots. Alongside fixed-wing operations, it also plans to utilise a fleet of eVTOL aircraft on intercity routes.


### Brand imaging

The airline's livery is based on a stylised rendition of the flag of the United Kingdom. As such, its aircraft carry the tagline "Flag Carrier for Green Britain", with this also being a reference to the Green Britain Group, a company founded by Dale Vince which has shareholdings in ventures such as Ecotricity. The airline's slogan is "Another way."

In January 2025 the airline began using "Same altitude, new attitude" as a secondary slogan.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Fleet

Dale Vince originally claimed that Ecojet was to launch with the 19-seat Twin Otter aircraft before upscaling to a 70-seat airliner 18 months thereafter. However, in January 2024, the company began hiring for ATR 72 crew to begin operations before mid-2024, with this later being pushed back to 2025.

On 29 November 2023, Ecojet signed an agreement to acquire 70 hydrogen-electric powerplants from ZeroAvia, on lease from MONTE.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 25 July 2024, Ecojet announced that it had signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) to acquire up to 50 Linx P9 aircraft from ARC Aerosystems. The following day, ZeroAvia announced a further agreement with Ecojet for the purchase of 22 ZA2000 engines.

In November 2024 the airline announced that it had acquired "its first two ATR 72-600 aircraft."
