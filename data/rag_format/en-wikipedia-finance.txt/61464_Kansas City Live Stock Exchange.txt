## Architecture

Construction began in 1909 and was completed in 1911, as the largest livestock exchange building in the world. In 1957, a one-story addition was constructed on the south side for the Golden Ox restaurant which had opened in 1949.

The building has been renovated as offices with many business and personal services, including a coffee shop with breakfast and lunch, a barber salon, and a health club with masseuse. Its U.S. Post Office closed in December 2008.
