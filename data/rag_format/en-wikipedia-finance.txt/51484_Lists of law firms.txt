# Lists of law firms



Numerous current and former law firms are considered notable. Law firms are typically ranked by profit per partner, or at a more general level, revenue. Some private directories also assign subjective rankings to law firms, including Chambers and Partners and The Legal 500, although these are falling out of favour.
