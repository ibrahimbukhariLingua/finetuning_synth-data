Hong Kong Commercial Daily


# Hong Kong Commercial Daily



The ***Hong Kong Commercial Daily*** (Chinese: 香港商報) (HKCD) is a Chinese state-owned newspaper, published in broadsheet format in Hong Kong and dubbed “China’s international media window” by the central government. Established in 1952, it was the first financial newspaper in the Chinese language. It is one of the few newspapers authorized by the Hong Kong SAR government to publicize legal announcements, and also the only Hong Kong newspaper allowed to be circulated freely in mainland China. It is controlled by the Hong Kong Liaison Office and has a branch office in Shenzhen.

As of September 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of *Hong Kong Commercial Daily*, Guangdong Xin Wenhua, to be "Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media" under its State Media Matrix.


## History

The *HKCD* was founded on October 11, 1952, at a price of 10 HK cents. Its stated aim was to serve as the voice of the local Hong Kong commerce with a focus on worldwide economies especially in Hong Kong and China. It also covered sports and on weekends offered columns and serialized short stories with pictures.

Early coverage of horse and dog racing was curtailed by the government in the early 70s, so as not to promote gambling, leading to a severe decline in circulation.

In December 1989, a majority shareholding was acquired by the Joint Publishing (HK) Company Limited (the joint company of The Commercial Press (H.K.) Ltd, Chung Hwa Book Co., and Joint Publishing) for HK$160 million.

In 1995, *HKCD* launched a mainland edition in cooperation with mainland publishing companies. Since 1996, an online version has been available.

In May 2005, the paper was upgraded priced at HK$3 in Hong Kong and overseas while in Mainland China it sold for 3 yuan within Guangdong Province and 5 yuan in other provinces.
The new version of the paper emphasizes business news from Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, along with some sports coverage.

In 2015, assistant editor-in-chief Long Zhenyang was placed under "political measures" for comments he made during the 2014 Hong Kong protests and regarding the demolition of churches in Zhejiang. For the following year, he did not work as an editor but was allowed to continue writing, and in February 2016 resigned and sought political asylum in the United States, comparing the sociopolitical climate in Chinese politics to the Cultural Revolution, and saying that "All hope for social reform and reforms to China’s political system, have now been extinguished."
