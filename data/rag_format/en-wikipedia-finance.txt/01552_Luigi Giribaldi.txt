# Luigi Giribaldi



**Luigi Giribaldi** (1925-2012) was an Italian industrialist and corporate raider. He was the founder of the first national logistics and transportation firm in Italy, TRACO, and played a key role in several high-profile corporate takeovers and investments.


## Early life and career

Giribaldi was born in Cavallermaggiore, Italy. His business journey began in the 1960s in Turin, where he founded the express transport firm TRACO. Under his leadership, the firm evolved into Italy's first national logistics company. Giribaldi was a pioneer in express transport, and the company became a frontrunner in Europe too. In the late 1980s, he sold TRACO to the multinational group TNT, establishing him as a major player in the Italian business scene and the most liquid businessman in Italy after Gianni Agnelli. He remained Chairman of TNT Italy until 1991.


## Career as a corporate raider

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Giribaldi gained prominence as a corporate raider with strategies that helped to revive the financial environment in Italy following a period of instability. Notable ventures included his investment in Carlo De Benedetti’s CIR and Cofide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1999, he invested in the Italian industrial and chemical group Snia, building a significant stake and challenging the control of Cesare Romiti. His move was part of a broader trend where corporate raiders across Europe, such as François Pinault and Martin Ebner, aimed to disrupt traditional European business practices. Giribaldi’s activities highlighted the growing influence of shareholder activism in Europe, as detailed in Ettore Croci's book, “*Shareholder Activism: Azionisti, investitori istituzionali e hedge fund*”.

In 2000, Giribaldi purchased a stake in HdP, which owned fashion house Valentino and the daily Italian paper Corriere della Sera.

In 2001, he acquired a stake in the Scottish cashmere company Dawson International. This move was part of a broader strategy to diversify his investments and capitalise on undervalued assets in different geographies. In the same year, Giribaldi invested in IT Holding (ITH), a fashion production company which owned the brand Gianfranco Ferré and Malo and produced clothes for brands such as Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Etro and Exte’. His involvement aimed to stabilise ITH's finances and expand his portfolio in the fashion and luxury goods sector.


### Toro Calcio

In the 1990s, Giribaldi attempted to buy the football team Torino Calcio following the financial collapse of the club under its previous president, Gian Mauro Borsano. Despite his efforts and passion for the club, his bid was ultimately unsuccessful.


### Later life and legacy

In the early 2000s, Giribaldi moved to Monte-Carlo, Monaco, and continued to make and manage his investments from there. He was an avid collector of luxury cars and watches. Giribaldi passed away at the age of 87 in Turin. His legacy left a lasting impact on the fields of logistics, transportation and corporate finance in Italy and abroad. Giribaldi is still considered today as one of the early European activist investors alongside Vincent Bollore, François Pinault and Martin Ebner.
