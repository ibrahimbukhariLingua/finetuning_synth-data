Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative


# Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative



The **Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative** was a five-year program, supported by Swiss bank UBS in which the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation identified and works with artists, curators and educators from South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa to expand its reach in the international art world. For each of the three phases of the project, the museum invited one curator from the chosen region to the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum in New York City for a two-year curatorial residency, where they worked with a team of Guggenheim staff to identify new artworks that reflect the range of talents in their parts of the world. The resident curators organized international touring exhibitions that highlight these artworks and help organize educational activities. The Foundation acquired these artworks for its permanent collection and included them as the focus of exhibitions that open at the museum in New York and subsequently traveled to two other cultural institutions or other venues around the world. The Foundation supplemented the exhibitions with a series of public and online programs, and supported cross-cultural exchange and collaboration between staff members of the institutions hosting the exhibitions. UBS reportedly contributied more than $40 million to the project to pay for its activities and the art acquisitions. Foundation director Richard Armstrong commented: "We are hoping to challenge our Western-centric view of art history."
