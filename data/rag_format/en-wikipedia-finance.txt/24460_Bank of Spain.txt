Bank of Spain


# Bank of Spain



The **Bank of Spain** (Spanish: *Banco de España*, pronounced [ˈbaŋko ðe esˈpaɲa]) is Spain's central bank and the Spanish member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Spain from 1874 to 1998, issuing the Spanish peseta. Since 2014, it has also been Spain's national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. It was originally established by Charles III in Madrid in 1782, as the ***Banco Nacional de San Carlos***, and took its current name in 1856. Its activity is regulated by the Bank of Spain Autonomy Act. The bank doesn't translate its name to English but uses its Spanish name in all English communications.

The Bank of Spain holds 9.1 million troy ounces of gold (around 283 tons) (2019), which are stored in its own vaults and in various institutions in London and New York. According to IMF data, Spain ranks 20th among the 40 largest gold reserves in the world (as of July 2015).

In January 2021, the snowstorm "Filomena" caused the clock at the Bank of Spain to freeze for the first time in 130 years. This occurred at 11:35 a.m. on Saturday, 9 January.


## History

Originally named the *Banco Nacional de San Carlos*, it was founded in 1782 by Charles III in Madrid, to stabilize government finances through its state bonds (*vales reales*) following the American Revolutionary War in which Spain gave military and financial support to the Thirteen Colonies. Although it aided the state, the bank was initially owned privately by stockholders. Its assets included those of "Spanish capitalists, French rentiers, and several treasuries of Indian communities in New Spain" (colonial Mexico). Its first director was the French banker François Cabarrus, known in Spain as Francisco Cabarrús.

Following the Napoleonic invasion of Spain during the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1813, the bank was owed more than 300 million reales by the state, placing it in financial difficulty. Treasury Minister Luis López Ballesteros created a fund of 40 million reales in 1829 against which the bank could issue its own notes at Madrid. It did so after renaming itself *Banco Español de San Fernando* (the name of the king of Spain was Fernando VII).

In 1844 the competing Banco de Isabel II and Banco de Barcelona [es] were established, followed in 1846 by the Banco de Cádiz [es]. In 1847, after overexposure in the failing property market of Madrid, the Banco de Isabel II merged with Banco de San Fernando and retained the latter name.

Under the guidance of Ramón Santillán in the 1850s, the bank extended its operations to the cities of Alicante and Valencia and took the name, *Banco de España*. Requiring financial support from the bank to back its civil and colonial wars, the government of Spain granted the Banco de España a monopoly on the issuance of Spanish bank notes in 1874. Construction of the bank's headquarters building began in 1884 at the crossing of the Calle de Alcalá and the Paseo del Prado in Madrid.

In 1936, 510 tonnes of gold reserves were transferred to the Soviet Union (in an event known as Moscow gold) corresponding to 72.6% of the total gold reserves of the Bank of Spain. That gold remained there during the Spanish Civil War.

In 1946, the government of General Franco placed the bank under tight control. It was formally nationalised in 1962. After the restoration of democracy in the late 1970s, the bank began a series of transformations and modernisations which continue to today.

On Spain's entry into the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union in 1994, the Banco de España became a member of the European System of Central Banks. The Bank of Spain holds 8.84% of the ECB's capital.


## Governing structures

The governing structures of the Bank is divided among four branches:

* The Governor.
* The Deputy Governor.
* The Governing Council.
* The Executive Commission.

The Governor of the Bank of Spain is formally appointed after the Prime Minister of Spain has designated him/her by the Spanish monarch. The Governor must be a Spanish citizen recognized for his or her competence in monetary or banking matters. When a new Governor is named, the Minister of Economy and Finance, in accord with procedure established by the Congress of Deputies, informs the competent parliamentary commission.

The Deputy Governor, designated by the national Government on the recommendation of the Governor of the Bank, should meet all of the official qualifications for the governorship. The current Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain is Margarita Delgado. The Deputy Governor substitutes for the Governor in cases of vacancy, absence or illness, both as director of the Bank and as its representative. Further responsibilities of this office are a matter internal to the Bank, and are delegated by the Governor.

Six Bank Counsellors are named by the national Government, on the proposal of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with the involvement of the Governor of the Bank. They must be Spanish citizens recognized for their competence in economics or law.
