Transparency International Bangladesh


# Transparency International Bangladesh



**Transparency International Bangladesh** (**TIB**) is the Bangladeshi branch of the Berlin-based Transparency International, a civil society organisation dedicated to fighting against corruption.


## History

TIB started its activities in 1997, under founding chairman Syed Humayun Kabir.

In 2016, it criticised new government rules on NGOs that received foreign funding. It also asked the government to not take a 2 billion dollar development loan from the world Bank. This law was created after TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman called the country's Parliament a 'puppet show stage'.
