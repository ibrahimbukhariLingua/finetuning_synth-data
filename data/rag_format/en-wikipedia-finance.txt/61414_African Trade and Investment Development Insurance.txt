# African Trade and Investment Development Insurance



The **African Trade & Investment Development Insurance** (**ATIDI**) is an investment, trade and political risk-mitigation institution on the African continent intended to provide insurance against political (investment) and commercial risks in order to attract foreign direct investment to the region. ATIDI was founded in 2001 by seven COMESA countries, with technical and financial backing of The World Bank.

ATIDI is Africa's only multilateral investment and credit insurer and as of 31 December 2023 it had supported trade and investments into Africa valued at over USD85 billion since inception. ATIDI facilitates partnerships between African countries, lenders, investors, traders and insurers by providing Political (Investment) Risk Insurance to lenders and investors and also (Trade) Credit Insurance and Surety Bonds to commercial bank lenders and private sector traders of goods and services.


## History

ATIDI was created in 2001 as **African Trade Insurance Agency** (**ATI**), to help drive much needed investment insurance capacity to Africa in order to support higher levels of foreign direct investments. Seven COMESA countries obtained a grant from the World Bank to conduct a study to look at factors contributing the low levels of FDI to their countries. The study revealed political risk to be the main constraint and the primary concern for prospective investors. The study expanded into a World Bank project (The Regional Trade Facilitation Project I) from which ATI was created. ATI was launched in 2001 in Kampala, Uganda and opened its doors in Nairobi, Kenya, ATIDI's headquarters.
