# Miss Grand International (company)



**Miss Grand International** (MGI PCL) is a Thai conglomerate founded in 2013 by Nawat Itsaragrisil, headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand. It comprises numerous businesses in various industries of advertisement, cosmetics, entertainment, events, health products, processed food, talent management, jewelry and aesthetic medicine.

Initially, it was only responsible for the management of the Miss Grand Thailand and Miss Grand International pageants but was later expanded and diversified into other business sectors in the late 2010s.


## History

The company was established as a limited company on November 6, 2013, with an authorized capital of one million Bath, and is chaired by Nawat Itsaragrisil, a Thai television host and producer who had previously served as producer of Miss Thailand World for BEC-Tero. After ending his role with BEC-Tero, Nawat signed a business partnership with Channel 7 and subsequently established his national pageant, Miss Grand Thailand, in mid-2013 and the newly established international pageant, Miss Grand International, which was managed by the Miss Grand International Co., Ltd..

Alongside its flagship beauty pageant, the company eventually expanded and diversified into the food-processing and cosmetics industries in 2018 as well as the talent management sector in 2019, which led the company to increase its authorized capital to 50 and 75 million Baht in 2020 and 2022, respectively.

The MGI Co., Ltd. was transformed into a public limited company with a registered capital of 105 million Baht on June 15, 2022, and was listed on the Market for Alternative Investment (MAI) on December 14, 2023. In the corporation with Karmarts, its subsidiary, KMGI Co., Ltd., was established in February 2023 to be responsible for the cosmetics section specifically.

The company also plans to invest in the jewelry segment and aesthetic medicine in late 2024.
