## History


### Movenpick Canada

The company traces it roots to its predecessor Movenpick Canada, the Canadian subsidiary of the Swiss-based Mövenpick, which opened its first restaurant, a traditional table service Mövenpick, on York Street in 1980. In 1982, Hans Jorg Reichert was transferred from Zürich to Toronto to manage the Canadian subsidiary. As manager, Reichert imported a new moderate-priced upscale European-style self-serve restaurant concept based upon an open market which was called Mövenpick Marché, which first opened in Stuttgart in 1983. The first Canadian Mövenpick Marché opened in Brookfield Place, formerly BCE Place, in 1992.


### Richtree

After growing the subsidiary within the Toronto metropolitan area, Reichert convinced his Swiss bosses that everyone would make more money if the Canadian restaurants were sold to him and operated under a franchise agreement. In 1996, Reichert formed Richtree Market Restaurants Inc. to purchase the Movenpick restaurants in Canada and the franchise rights for North America. To fuel the new company's rapid expansion, Richtree became a public stock company in February 1997 by selling stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the stock symbol MOO.b.

The company had one owned-and-operated location at Square One, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

The flagship, downtown Toronto location, at Brookfield Place (formerly BCE Place), went out of business in January 2010. Mövenpick returned to Canada and reopened the location back under the Mövenpick Marché name. In April 2020, Mövenpick's Canadian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy and closed all its Canadian restaurants.
