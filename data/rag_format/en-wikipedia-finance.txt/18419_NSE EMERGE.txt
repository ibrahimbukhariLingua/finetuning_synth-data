NSE EMERGE


# NSE EMERGE



**NSE EMERGE** is the National Stock Exchange of India's new initiative for small and medium-sized enterprises and startup companies from India. These companies can get listed on NSE without Initial public offering (IPO). This platform helps SMEs and Startups to connect with investors for funding. During August 2019, NSE got the 200th company listed on its SME platform. As of 30 September 2024, 556 companies had listed on the Emerge platform, raising approximately INR 14,145 crore collectively.
The First company listed on the SME IPO platform was Thejo Engineering from Chennai and Prizor Viztech was the 500th firm to be listed on the platform.


## SME IPO

SME IPO is specially designed for SMEs and Startups to raise a capital with minimum compliance and cost compare to regular IPO. In case of NSE EMERGE, companies need to take an approval from board, not SEBI.

Many companies have shifted to main board from SME platform, which shows the success of the SME exchange by NSE.

Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) serve as a critical avenue for smaller businesses to raise capital and expand their operations. SME IPOs are typically listed on dedicated platforms, such as the SME exchanges of leading stock markets, which are tailored to meet the unique needs of smaller enterprises. These platforms offer lower compliance requirements and reduced listing costs compared to the main board, making them accessible for emerging businesses. Investors in SME IPOs often benefit from higher growth potential, although they must be prepared for increased risks due to the smaller size and limited operational history of the companies. SME IPOs play a significant role in fostering entrepreneurship and boosting economic growth.
