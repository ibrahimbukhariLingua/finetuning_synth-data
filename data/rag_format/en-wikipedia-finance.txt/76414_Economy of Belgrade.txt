## History


### Growth of investments in Belgrade

The troubled political and economic transition during the 1990s left Belgrade, like the rest of the country, severely affected by an internationally imposed trade embargo. The hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar, the highest inflation ever recorded in the world, decimated the city's economy
In the competition for European cities and regions of the future in 2006 and 2007, organized by the *Financial Times* magazine, Belgrade was proclaimed "City of the Future in Southern Europe" on 16 March in Cannes.

The latest greenfield investments are also being increasingly realized in Zemun, the part of the city which will soon be on a par, according to investments, with New Belgrade, where the largest construction works have been carried out so far. The mayor expects foreign capital to start arriving faster in Belgrade and Serbia, which is also the precondition for the opening of new jobs and the start of new programs.

The competition for "Cities and Regions of the Future" is organized by the specialized edition of the *Financial Times* for foreign direct investments – *FDI Magazine*, and this prestigious annual award is presented for all the continents. The award also represents a recommendation of the world’s leading economic magazine for the locations where one should invest, since it is based on criteria such as economic potential, operating costs, human resources, transport, IT and telecommunication, as well as the quality of life for foreign investors.
