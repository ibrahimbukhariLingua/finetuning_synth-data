*The Games Machine* praised the game booklet and felt that players would feel a "wide range of emotions" as their companies gain and lose value.

Rod Lawton for *ACE* complimented the game, saying "if you've got any entrepreneurial blood in you at all you'll be hooked".

Rob Murray from *The Daily Telegraph* commended the graphic display, and felt that "Much thought has gone into the program".
