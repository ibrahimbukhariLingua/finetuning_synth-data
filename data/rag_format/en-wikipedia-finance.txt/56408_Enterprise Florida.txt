Enterprise Florida


# Enterprise Florida



**Enterprise Florida, Inc.** **(EFI)** was a public–private partnership between Florida’s business and government leaders and was the principal economic development organization for the state of Florida. EFI’s mission was to expand and diversify the state’s economy through job creation. In pursuit of its mission, EFI worked closely with a statewide network of economic development partners and was funded both by the State of Florida and by private-sector businesses. Enterprise Florida did not disclose who its donors were.

During the 2023 Florida legislative session, Speaker Paul Renner called for dissolution of the entity and instead diverted its funding to the Florida DEO. Some programs of Enterprise Florida were transferred to a new entity, **SelectFlorida**.


## History

In 1978, the responsibilities of the Florida Department of Commerce were split with the Department of Labor and Employment Security.

In 1996, under Governor Lawton Chiles, Florida became the first state in the nation to place principal responsibility for economic development, international trade, research and marketing in the hands of a business-government partnership. This move was motivated by the belief that with hands-on participation by Florida businesses, the state could develop a sophisticated economy driven by a diverse array industries and international business partners. Since its initial adoption by Florida in 1996, many U.S. states have gone on to implement this highly successful model.

On July 1, 2023 Florida House Bill 5 dissolved Enterprise Florida and transferred over 20 programs and their associated contracts to the Department of Economic Opportunity, which again was reorganized as the Florida Department of Commerce.


## Leadership

The Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI) Board of Directors comprised 59 members that represented businesses, government and other institutions in Florida. Current governor Ron DeSantis served the Board as an Appointed/Statute as the Governor, State of Florida and is the current Chairman.

With the creation of EFI, Florida became the first state to convert its Department of Commerce into a 501(c)(3) public-private partnership in which business has a leadership role. As such, EFI’s Board of Directors voting members represent Florida businesses, trade organizations, educational institutions, governments and economic development organizations. Just as businesses and citizens strengthen their communities through volunteerism, EFI’s board members do the same by participating in job creation efforts on behalf of the state.

On January 7, 2019, Jamal Sowell was named President & CEO of Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
