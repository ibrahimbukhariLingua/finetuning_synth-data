PepsiAmericas


# PepsiAmericas



**PepsiAmericas, Inc.** was the world's second-largest bottler of Pepsi-Cola products, under contract with product owner PepsiCo. PepsiAmericas also held contracts to produce beverages for Dr Pepper Snapple Group and smaller regional brands. PepsiAmericas had 19 bottling plants in the United States and had a presence in 11 countries in Central/Eastern Europe and 5 countries in the Caribbean. PepsiAmericas was based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

By early 2009, PepsiCo held a 41.1% stake in the PepsiAmericas. On April 20, 2009, PepsiCo offered to buy the remaining portion of PepsiAmericas, at an offer of $23.27 – or $11.64 plus 0.223 PepsiCo shares – in exchange for each PepsiAmericas share. In August 2009, PepsiCo also made an offer for Pepsi Bottling Group, the world's largest bottler of Pepsi-Cola products. On February 26, 2010, after regulatory review, PepsiCo's acquisitions of the two bottling companies was completed, forming a new, wholly owned subsidiary, the **Pepsi Beverages Company**.

It later diversified out of railroads and into Pepsi bottling, going by the names **Illinois Central Industries** in 1962, **IC Industries** in 1975 and Whitman Corp. in 1988.
