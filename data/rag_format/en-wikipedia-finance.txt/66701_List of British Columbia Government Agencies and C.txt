List of British Columbia Government Agencies and Crown Corporations


# List of British Columbia Government Agencies and Crown Corporations



This is a list of **crown corporations and agencies of the Government of British Columbia**.

Crown corporations in BC are public-sector organizations established and funded by the Government of British Columbia to provide specialized goods and services to citizens. They operate at varying levels of government control, depending on how they are defined, funded, and the kinds of services they provide. In general, though they are technically owned by the government, they operate at arm's length from the public service and the elected officials of the government.

Individually, every public sector organization in BC is assigned a ministry that is responsible for the organization. That minister is the primary link between the B.C. government and the organization and is held accountable to the government for the performance of the organization. The **Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office** (**CABRO**) is responsible for supporting the governance of these organizations as a whole.
