**C3.ai, Inc.** (also **C3 AI**) is an American technology company specializing in enterprise artificial intelligence. Based in Redwood City, California, the company founded in 2009 by Thomas Siebel became a public company in 2020 and trades on the Nasdaq.


## History

C3.ai was founded in 2009 by Thomas Siebel as "C3". Originally the "C" in the company's name was a reference to "carbon" and the "3" was a reference to "measure, mitigate and monetize" because the company's original goal was to help manage corporate carbon footprints. For some time in 2016 the company was named **C3IoT** and before that was briefly named **C3 Energy**. The company went public in 2020. Following their IPO C3.ai faced market skepticism and criticism, including that Siebel liquidated shares worth hundreds of millions of dollars soon after the IPO.
