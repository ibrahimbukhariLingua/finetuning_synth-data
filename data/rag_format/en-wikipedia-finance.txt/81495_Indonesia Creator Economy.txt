# Indonesia Creator Economy



**Indonesia Creators Economy** (**ICE**) is a content creator marketplace from Indonesia owned by IDN. ICE was founded to facilitate access to the creators economy for creators in Indonesia, by bridging collaboration between brands and local creators, from nano content creator to mega content creator.


## History

Previously, ICE was called **IDN Creator Network**, a creator platform in Indonesia owned by IDN Media which was founded on March 8, 2017. IDN Creator Network changed its name to **ICE** on March 8, 2022. IDN Creator Network has become the leading creator platform in Indonesia, which collaborates with more than ten thousand content creators and 300 brands.


## Application

In 2023, ICE launched the ICE app. This is a creator and marketplace platform that offers collaboration between brands and creators. ICE plans to offer payment systems and financial products to increase efficiency and speed in every collaboration.

In order to attract more talent in the creator economy, on September 8, 2023, MORF, a talent management platform founded by Deddy Corbuzier, became part of the IDN Media ecosystem.
