## History

Neeraj Gupta founded the V-Link Group in 2000. Started as a staff transportation business, V-Link Fleet Solutions expanded its business and provided services to clients in the BPO sector. In a duration of 4 years, V-Link expanded to a fleet of 1300 vehicles.

In August 2006, Maharashtra government invited tenders for running a fleet of 10,000 taxis in Mumbai in an attempt to replace the already existing black-yellow cabs (Kaali-peeli taxis). It was during this time that V-Link collaborated with venture capital firm True North, formerly known as India Value Fund (IVF), to form Meru. With initial funding of INR 500 million, Meru was launched in Mumbai offering AC cabs to India for the first time, with electronic meters and GPS/GPRS system cabs via the call booking system. In a short time, Meru scaled up its services to the top 4 cities of India with a fleet of 5000 cabs by 2010.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
