Logothetes ton sekreton


# Logothetes ton sekreton



The ***logothetēs tōn sekretōn*** (Ancient Greek: λογοθέτης τῶν σεκρέτων) was an official supervising all the *sekreta* (fiscal departments) of the Byzantine Empire during the Komnenian period. In the early 13th century, his office evolved into the *megas logothetes*.


## History and functions

The post was first established by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118), in an attempt to improve the coordination of the various departments (*sekreta*). The fiscal departments in particular were further grouped under two other officials: the two principal treasury departments, the *genikon* and *eidikon*, were put under the *megas logariastēs tōn sekretōn* (μέγας λογαριαστής τῶν σεκρέτων, "grand accountant of the *sekreta*"), while the *megas logariastēs tōn euagōn sekretōn* (μέγας λογαριαστής τῶν εὐαγῶν σεκρέτων) oversaw the "pious bureaux" (εὐαγή σεκρέτα, *euagē sekreta*), i.e. imperial estates and religious foundations. In the late 12th century, the *logothetēs tōn sekretōn* had become the *megas logothetēs*, an office which survived until the Fall of Constantinople in May 1453.
