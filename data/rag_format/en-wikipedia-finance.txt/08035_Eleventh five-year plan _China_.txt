Eleventh five-year plan (China)


# Eleventh five-year plan (China)



The **11th Five-Year Plan** of China, officially the **11th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the People's Republic of China**, was a set of economic goals designed to strengthen the Chinese economy between 2006 and 2010.

The planning philosophy for the 11th Five-Year Plan was significantly shaped by a mid-term evaluation of the 10th Five-Year Plan.¹³⁴ The 11th Five-Year Plan introduced a new category of "binding targets" (*yueshuxing zhibiao*) intended as government promises.¹³⁴–¹³⁵ These binding targets have since been used especially in non-economic policy areas like environmental protection and land management.¹⁵⁰ Of 22 targets listed in the 11th Five-Year Plan, eight of them were binding targets.¹⁸⁴ These binding targets were incorporated into the criteria for local cadre performance evaluations.¹⁸⁴ The Plan also reflected a change in terminology to the allocation of administrative resourced via "programs" rather than "plans."¹³⁴

Beginning with the 11th, each of China's Five Year plans have sought to move China away from energy-intensive manufacturing and into high-value sectors and have highlighted the importance of low-carbon technology as a strategic emerging industry, particularly in the areas of wind and solar power.²⁶–²⁷ The plan adopted a more assertive approach to technology transfer in advanced technology. The plan set a national energy intensity target⁵⁴ of a 20% reduction.¹⁶⁷ It was identified as a "binding target" and focused on throughout the plan's implementation.¹⁶⁷ Policymakers viewed emissions reductions and energy conservation as the highest priority environmental matters under the 11th Five-Year Plan.¹³⁶


## Results

Successful achievement of emissions and energy conservation targets in the 11th Five-Year Plan shaped policymaker's approach for the 12th Five-Year Plan, prompting expanded use of binding targets to capitalize on successes in these areas.¹³⁶
