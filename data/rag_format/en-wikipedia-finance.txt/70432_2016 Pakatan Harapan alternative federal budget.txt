2016 Pakatan Harapan alternative federal budget


# 2016 Pakatan Harapan alternative federal budget



The **Malaysian alternative federal budget** for the 2016 fiscal year was launched by Pakatan Harapan on 21 October 2015, two days before the Malaysian Budget Day, as a response to the government's federal budget.


## Areas of direction

Some of the key items in the alternative budget were:

* Implementing the capital gains tax since this is also being implemented in 127 countries, including all European countries which are part of the OECD.
* Implementing the inheritance tax since many OECD members already implemented.
* Restructuring of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) by putting the firm into administration and prosecuting wrongdoers.
* Separation of Prime Minister and Finance Minister portfolios to avoid excessive concentration of power held by one individual.
* Support extension of Zeti Akhtar Aziz's term as Bank Negara Malaysia governor by two more years.
* For a short term, keeping Goods and Services Tax (GST) system by zero-rating all items to mitigate inflation.
* To set up a petroleum endowment fund for East Malaysians.
* The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high speed rail (HSR) project funds will instead be reallocated to building a rail network in Sabah and Sarawak.
* Offset the loss of GST income by making MYR30 billion in savings by stamping out "wastage and corruption", and also by shutting down several state-linked corporations.
* Reducing PETRONAS dividend to MYR20 billion.
* Revamping cash handouts such as Bantuan Rakyat 1Malaysia (BR1M) to be conditional on employment and school attendance; the low-income parents must work and send their children to schools.
* Focusing more on agriculture because the country's agricultural policies were “backward, if compared with other countries”; it is necessary to give the subsidies directly to the farmers and also provide a subsidy for the price of rice.
* Parliamentary oversight of sovereign wealth funds for greater accountability, accountability and full independence of regulators which include the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), Attorney-General of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia and Parliament of Malaysia.
* Focus in bridging the economic activities' gap in Peninsular Malaysia and those in Sabah and Sarawak.
