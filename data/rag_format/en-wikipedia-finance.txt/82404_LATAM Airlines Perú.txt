## History

LAN Peru was established in July 1998 by the entrepreneurs Mr. Boris Hirmas Rubio, Lorenzo Sousa Debarbieri, Cristian Said and Dr Javier Rodriguez Larrain and LAN-Chile in Lima. Operations began on 2 July 1999, with domestic services from Jorge Chávez International Airport to Cusco and Arequipa. Its launch marked the reappearance of a new major national airline in Peru after the demise of giants Aeroperú, Faucett Perú and others. An international service to Miami was added on November 15, 1999.

The airline became a subsidiary of LAN Airlines in September 2002, owned by LAN (49%), ER Larraín (30%), and Inversiones Aéreas (21%) and has 1,500 employees. In 2004, it was incorporated into LAN Airlines holding with the change of the name of the parent company.

In 2004, a court order temporarily suspended flights because of alleged irregularities in the company's incorporation.Subsequently, the ruling party generated controversy for questioning the work of Judge Eloy Zamalloa, who denounced the promulgation of a decree law that opposed such a judicial decision.

During the third quarter of 2006, LAN Peru added 8 new Airbus A319s to its fleet, intended to replace its Boeing 737-200s for domestic operations in Peruvian territory. In October 2006, LAN Perú obtained authorization from the Peruvian DGAC to operate as an Aeronautical Maintenance Workshop (TMA), granting it the number 029. This allows it, in addition to supporting LAN operations, to offer service to other companies that have aircraft with Peruvian registration.

In 2008, the airline transported about 3.5 million passengers, with 2.9 million in the domestic market. In October 2009, the airline was authorized to provide aircraft maintenance services.

LAN Peru was dissolved on August 6, 2015, upon completion of the merger between LAN Airlines and TAM Airlines announced on August 13 2010 creating the LATAM Airlines Group, one of the largest commercial airline consortiums in Latin America and one of the largest worldwide. Subsequently, on May 5, 2016 (almost 6 years after the beginning of the merger with TAM Líneas Aéreas) it began to operate officially and definitively as LATAM Airlines, which meant the change of corporate image and brand, which is estimated to cost $60 million US dollars.

On 26 September 2019, Delta Air Lines announced its plans to buy 20% of the LATAM Airlines Group for $1.9 billion, to expand Delta's access to the Latin American market. Additionally, Delta agreed to pay LATAM's exit fee from Oneworld and to take delivery of all Airbus A350 XWB aircraft that LATAM had on order. On 1 January 2020, it was reported that Delta Air Lines' acquisition of the 20% stake in the LATAM group was completed. Group CEO Enrique Cueto stepped down on 31 March 2020, and was succeeded by Roberto Alvo, the group's then-current Chief Commercial Officer. On 31 January 2020, LATAM announced that it would leave Oneworld three months later on 1 May.

On 26 May 2020, the LATAM Airlines Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States due to economic problems attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, although they are currently operating and have been negotiating terms. In August, the company announced its second-quarter results, projecting improved operational prospects. To assist with the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, the company announced that its subsidiary LATAM Peru would help distribute vaccines to fifteen provinces in Peru for free.

In 2024, LATAM Peru, along with the other LATAM subsidiaries would receive a new livery with the countries national colors.
