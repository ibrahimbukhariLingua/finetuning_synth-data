## Divisions


### Business and Community Development

The Business and Community Development (BCD) division provides financial and technical services to businesses, communities, and economic development professionals. The division promotes and assists in the expansion of exports and works with Minnesota-based companies that are interested in expansion. BCD also works with companies interested in relocating to Minnesota. Additionally, BCD helps Minnesota communities with financing infrastructure projects.


### Workforce Development

The Workforce Development Division works with local and statewide partners to provide training and support to unemployed and dislocated workers, and financial assistance for businesses seeking to upgrade the skills of their workforce. Additional services include state services for the blind, rehabilitation services, local labor exchange, and disability determination. Many of these services are provided at CareerForce locations throughout the state.


### Unemployment Insurance

The unemployment insurance division provides a temporary partial wage replacement to Minnesota workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own. It is an economic stabilizer and stimulator during economic downturns and helps maintain an available skilled workforce.


### Communications, Analysis, and Research

The Communications, Analysis and Research Division coordinates DEED’s information resources and provides centralized services in the areas of communications, marketing, publications, economic analysis, and labor market and other research. The division also implements the state branding program—Positively Minnesota—in partnership with business, industry, education, and governmental organizations.
