## History

Tata Sky was a joint venture between the Tata Group and News Corporation, which owned 80% and 20% stakes respectively until 2008, when Singapore-based Temasek Holdings picked up a 10% stake in Tata Play from the Tata Group. Tata Sky was incorporated in 2001, but launched services on 8 August 2006.

Tata Sky's Holding company, 21st Century Fox, formerly owned an international group of DTH businesses that include Sky Italia in Italy and Sky UK in the United Kingdom. The company uses the Sky brand under a licence from Sky Group.

Tata Sky partnered with Ericsson to launch the first Video on Demand (VOD) services in India in 2012.
