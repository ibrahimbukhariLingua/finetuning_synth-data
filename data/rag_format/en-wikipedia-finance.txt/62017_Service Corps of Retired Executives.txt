# Service Corps of Retired Executives



**Service Corps of Retired Executives** (SCORE) is a non-profit organization of volunteer counselors who provide free mentoring, education programs, workshops, and webinars to small businesses. SCORE is a resource partner of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) who administers a Congressional grant which provides SCORE with funding. SCORE is headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, with over 233 chapters which are located in offices located throughout the United States. It is the nation's largest network of volunteer, expert business mentors.


## History

SCORE was chartered by an Act of the U.S. Congress in 1964 to provide technical and managerial guidance to the business community, profit and not-for-profit organizations, and prospective
entrepreneurs through the use of volunteer counselors. On October 5, 1964, SBA administrator, Eugene P. Foley officially launched SCORE. Walter H. Channing of Detroit, Michigan, served as its first president. By 1968 over 1,000 small businesses per month were receiving free business advice from SCORE. Since its founding it has helped over 10 million entrepreneurs.

A 2019 audit by the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (OIG) was highly critical of SCORE, finding that SCORE officials did not effectively oversee SCORE's use of federal funds, inappropriately solicited donations for mentoring services, charged for publication material that did not include the required SBA acknowledgement statement and improperly managed funds used for cosponsored activities. The OIG recommended that the SBA improve its oversight and monitoring of SCORE's use of government funds, and its reporting of performance results. The OIG also recommended that the SBA recover $713,986 of unallowable and unsupported costs.

By 2021 SCORE began to emphasize the importance diversity, equity and inclusion in business (DEI).

In 2023, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate, S-1896, entitled the SCORE Act of 2023 which would "overhaul SCORE to meet the needs of todayâ€™s dynamic economy and improve support for female and rural business owners".


## Operations

SCORE is governed by a 19 member board of directors. It has a team of approximately 50 salaried employees at its headquarters in Herndon, Virginia who support the organization of over 10,000 volunteers in 250 office locations throughout the U.S.

SCORE is primarily supported by a government grant, workshop fees and contributions. SCORE receives a majority of its financial support from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). SCORE is also supported by the SCORE Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization formed in 1996 to serve as the philanthropic arm of SCORE.
SCORE is exempt from federal and state income taxes on income under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

SCORE's website offers a comprehensive small business library with "how-to" guides, downloadable templates, checklists, articles, videos, infographics, and blogs. The website also hosts online workshops, and recorded webinars and interactive courses on demand.

SCORE volunteer mentors give free and confidential business advice to business owners using different communication methods, including phone, video, email and in-person meetings. There are four types of SCORE volunteering opportunities: business mentors, workshop presenters, subject matter experts and chapter support roles
From time to time SCORE gives the Walter H Channing Award. Named in honor of its founding president, it is the highest honor for volunteer service within SCORE.
