**Morningstar DBRS** is a global credit rating agency with offices in Toronto, New York, Chicago, London, Frankfurt and Madrid. Morningstar DBRS provides independent credit rating services for financial institutions, corporate and sovereign entities and structured finance products and instruments. It was originally founded as **Dominion Bond Rating Service** in Toronto in 1976, and its operations were integrated with Morningstar Credit Ratings to form Morningstar DBRS after its acquisition by the global financial services firm Morningstar, Inc. in 2019. It is the largest rating agency in Canada.

Morningstar DBRS is the fourth-largest credit rating agency by global market share, with between 2% and 3% of global market share. The company is one of only four CRAs, including Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings, to be recognized as an external credit assessment institution by the European Central Bank (ECB). In recent years, Morningstar DBRS' sovereign ratings on European nations, including Portugal, Ireland and Italy, were used by the ECB for such purposes.
