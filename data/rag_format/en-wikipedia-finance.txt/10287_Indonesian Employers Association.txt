## History and Leadership of APINDO

Referring to the Articles of Association made by notary Radeen Meester Soewandi with Deed Number 62 dated January 31, 1952, APINDO was established with the name Indonesian Entrepreneurs' Socio-Economic Affairs Consultative Body (Badan Permusyawaratan Urusan Sosial-Ekonomi Pengusaha Indonesia, abbreviated as PUSPI).

In the 1st PUSPI National Conference, January 15 -16th 1982 in Yogyakarta, it was agreed that the word "Perkumpulan" was changed to "Perhimpunan" so that the name became the Association of Socio-Economic Affairs of Entrepreneurs throughout Indonesia with the abbreviation unchanged, namely PUSPI.

Then, at the 2nd PUSPI National Conference on January, 29 – 30th 1985 in Surabaya, PUSPI changed its name to The Indonesian Employers’ Association (APINDO) currently.

During Sofjan Wanandi leadership era as Chairman of APINDO 2003 – 2013 period, it marked a new paradigm for APINDO in which APINDO delivered more strategic and comprehensive services to APINDO members.

Sofjan Wanandi was elected as Chairman of APINDO at the IX National Conference in Jakarta in 2013, but he resigned in 2014 since he was appointed as the Chair of the Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla's Expert Team.

APINDO's leadership as General Chair was continued by Hariyadi B. Sukamdani in the 2014 – 2018 and continued to 2018 – 2023 period.
