## Alberta's International Region

Alberta's International Region is an economic region effectively within the boundaries of Leduc County, including the City of Leduc. It is a major industrial hub located 20 kilometres south of Edmonton, Alberta’s capital city. Home to the largest developed energy services industrial park in Canada, three of the world’s top five oil services multinationals operate facilities within the region. The strategic location provides one of the most comprehensive and efficient multi-modal distribution systems in North America. Key sectors in the region include transportation and logistics, advanced manufacturing, energy services, and agri-foods processing.

Alberta’s International Region is an ideal place to locate a business due to its thriving economic environment, competitive tax regime, skilled workforce, and market access. The high quality of life, big city amenities and recreation opportunities here make Alberta’s International Region a great place to live and raise a family.

Alberta’s International Region was rated one of the top 25 places to do business in Western Canada (Alberta Venture, 2012) and as a Great Community for Business in Alberta (Alberta Venture, 2014).
