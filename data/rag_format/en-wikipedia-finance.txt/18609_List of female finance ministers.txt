List of female finance ministers


# List of female finance ministers



A **finance minister** is an executive or cabinet position in charge of the financial affairs of a state, which usually includes all matters pertaining to the government budget, economic and fiscal policy, and financial regulation. There have been many women appointed to that post around the world. This list comprises female finance ministers from around the world, either from sovereign states, limited recognized
states, federated states, autonomous regions, or sui generis entities. The finance minister's portfolio is usually entitled eponymously to that ministry or department, most commonly known as the **minister of finance**, although some countries may also have varied titles for this particular position. For instance, Britain's equivalent of a finance minister is the chancellor of the exchequer, while the department that the chancellor oversees, HM Treasury, has four subordinate junior ministers, and it is actually the British prime minister who holds the historic, albeit ceremonial, title of First Lord of the Treasury, with the chancellor always being Second Lord of the Treasury. Another example is the United States, where the primary functions of the nation's finance minister are performed by the secretary of the treasury, though there is a separate but assistant position of U.S. treasurer with limited statutory duties, and, contrary to tradition, the director of the Office of Management and Budget,
who is directly accountable to the president and not the treasury secretary, is charged with the main responsibility of budget drafting.

In some cases, the country's prime minister has concurrently served as finance minister. This was the case with Indira Gandhi of India and Eugenia Charles of Dominica, among others, who held both posts simultaneously. Moreover, the prime minister frequently designates the finance minister to serve in the simultaneous role of deputy prime minister to emphasize that position's importance.
