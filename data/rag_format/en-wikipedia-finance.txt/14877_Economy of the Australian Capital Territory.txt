Economy of the Australian Capital Territory


# Economy of the Australian Capital Territory



The **economy of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT)** is the fastest-growing, sixth biggest economy of Australia as of the end of the 2017-18 financial year.ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ Since the introduction of its self-government status in 1989, and with few exceptions in 1992, 1996, and 2014, the ACT economy has exhibited positive growth at a 1991-2018 average of 3.17 percent per year. A vast majority of the economy is concentrated in Canberra, the capital city of Australia, and is composed primarily (about 75%) by service industries, particularly those related to the administration of federal and local government. Construction also contributes to an important part of the economy, boosted by large government-funded projects and an active residential market. In contrast to other Australian states and territories, primary sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and mining, represent a very small proportion of the economy (±1%). A negative balance of trade has characterised the ACT economy since 2012-13, with small goods trade and a growing service export industry comprised mainly by education and public administration services.

As of March 2019ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the ACT exhibits the lowest unemployment rate at 3.6 percent, with almost a third of workers being employed in the public sector. State inflation has been slightly greater than the national rate since mid 2017, reaching 1.8% in the year to Q1 2019. As per the 2016 census, median weekly personal income was A$998, while in 2017-18 total yearly disposable income per capita was A$91,336. Fiscal policy since 2012 has been expansionary, with gradual reductions in payroll tax rates and stamp duties (specially those related to SMS businesses and other small commercial properties). ACT SMS businesses have received government support thorough marketing and financial initiatives since 2012. The A$5.7 billion 2018-19 budget put emphasis on healthcare services, education, and justice and other community services.

In order to integrate key economic sectors and advanced-knowledge industries through investment incentives, the government launched the Priority Investment Program (PIP) in late 2018 with a project budget of $9.75 million.


## Sectors and Industries


### Agriculture and forestry

With a total land area of 2,431 km², agriculture activity in the ACT employs approximately 15% of the territory, or 370 km², as of 2017. Agricultural output in 2016-17 was valued at 11 million, which represented a very minor proportion (<1%) of ACT total GDP (A$37.9 billion) and Australia's agricultural production (A$61 billion). Cattle and calves, wool, sheep and lambs are the main components of agriculture activity, jointly accounting for 60% of total production of the 36 farms in operation as of 2016-17.

By 2015-16, softwood plantation occupied less than 1 percent (74 km²) of the region, whereas 1,284 km² were devoted to non-commercial production of native forests. By the same year, there were 384 workers in the ACT forestry industry, a 24% fall from 2011.

As of 2017-18, agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, and manufacturing accounted for a 1.1% total (A$428 million) of ACT gross state product.


### Construction

In 2017-18, construction industry in the ACT accounted for 6% of its GSP, or gross value added of A$2.4 billion. Large construction projects have provided the ACT economy with important stimulus since 2017. There were about 13,200 workers in this industry in 2016, or 5.8% of the ACT employed labour force. The number of construction businesses has consistently increased since 2015-16, with a total of 5,512 by June 2018. 39 percent of firms in this industry generated between A$200,000 and A$2 million in 2017-18.


### Public administration and safety

The public sector is the main driver of economic performance in the ACT, as the largest portions of both employment and economic value are sourced from it.

In 2017-18, 25.9% of ACT GSP was made up of public administration and safety, by gross value added. Total GVA of this sector reached A$10.3 billion in the same year. Public sector jobs have been on the rise since 2001, growing by 70% between 2001-2016, the largest growth in employment by occupation in the ACT. As at 2016, almost a third (30.8%) of ACT workers were employed in the public sector. Due to the large dependency on its public sectors, the ACT economy is volatile to changes in government spending, with the biggest economic contributions and detractions in final state growth coming from it. Such economic risk, however, has been partially offset by small agriculture and mining sectors. In 2014, large-scale cuts in public service jobs, in conjunction with low levels of household consumption, reduced economic stimulus in subsequent years.


### Health care and social assistance

About A$4.4 billion (11%) was contributed to ACT GSP by health care and social assistance in 2017-18, thus being the second largest industry in the state. There were 23,980 persons employed in this industry by 2016, which accounted for almost 11 percent all workers.

Semi-universal health services access in Australia, in conjunction with an ageing population and technological advancements, has increased the volume of activity in this sector. Although health services in the ACT are small in comparison to other states and territories, government spending in this industry between 2007 and 2012 averaged a 10.3% grow per year (and 4.1% from 2012 to 2017).


### Other services

With manufacturing activities in the ACT having a losing relevance since the last decades of the 20th-century, the ACT tertiary sector (including public services, defence, health care, and social assistance, but excluding retail and wholesale trade) account for almost 75% of its employment and economic value-add.

Gross valued added by professional scientific and technical services in the ACT amounted to A$3.5 billion in 2017-18, or 8.7% of GSP, and contributed to the employment of 22,214 persons in 2016. Education and training also remained relevant, producing a GVA of A$2.3 billion in 2017-18, or 5.7% of GSP. The balance of services employed 37,458 workers in 2016.


### Exports and Imports

In 2017-18 total exports stood at A$2,230 million, while imports reached A$2,738 million, with a negative balance of trade of A$508 million. Services account for almost all exports (>99%) and imports (>90%) in the ACT. Since 2012-13, average annual goods and services exports growth has been 9.9%.

ACT goods exports in 2017-18 have been conformed by coin, raw materials and fishery (A$21 million value), with Switzerland being the main destination. Manufactured products and other finished goods accounts conform most of goods imports (A$265 million value). Education-related services represented 44.2% of services exports, followed by public goods and services (22.5%) and personal travel (11.5%). Public goods and services accounted for a 57.5% share of services imports, while personal and business travel contributing 35.1%

Services exports have grown by 22 percent since 2015, a notable industry growth in which the international education industry has played a major role. In 2016-17. There were approximately 17,000 international students in Canberra, reflecting an industry economic contribution of A$750 million per year. The ACT education industry has been enhanced by university investments and an active airline industry. By the same coin, tourism has also proved active, with projected economic contributions of $2.5 billion per year from 2020.


## Economic Policy


### Budget

The 2018-19 ACT budget stood at A$5.7 billion, equivalent to $35,152 per household, and it was sourced as depicted in Chart A. For the same financial year, the budget outlined a commitment of A$1.7 billion (29.8% of total) for healthcare services; A$1.3 billion (22.8%) for education; A$1.1 billion (19.3%) for justice, safety, and other community services; A$710 million (12.5%) for urban development and sustainability; A$438 million (7.7%) for public transport and other delivering services; and A$310 million (5.4%) for miscellaneous events, investment, and financial stewardship.


### Taxation

The taxation revenue component of the 2018-19 budget was composed as depicted in Chart B.

In consideration of the large proportion of small and medium-sized business in the region, the payroll tax threshold was gradually increased from 1.5 million in 2012 to 2 million in 2016-17, the highest among all Australian jurisdictions. In accordance to the 2018-19 ACT Budget, such policy ensures that 91% of business are not required to file payroll tax. Small businesses and investment have also been stimulated since June 2017 by the introduction of a stamp-duty relief on commercial properties whose maximum value is A$1.5 million.
