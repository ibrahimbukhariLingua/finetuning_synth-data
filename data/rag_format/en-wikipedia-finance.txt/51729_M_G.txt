## History


### Pre-2000

Municipal & General Securities Company Limited launched the First British Fixed Trust in 1931. It held the shares of 24
companies in a fixed portfolio that was not changed for the fixed lifespan of 20 years. The trust was relaunched as the M&G General Trust and later renamed as the Blue Chip Fund.

M&G Investments introduced its savings or "thrift" plans in 1954.

In March 1999 M&G Investments, which by then was the UK's largest unit trust group, was acquired by Prudential plc.


### 2000–2020

In May 2016, it announced it was to launch a direct online investment service for retail investors to invest directly in its range of funds.

In July 2016, M&G Investments suspended redemptions on its £4.4 billion Property Portfolio fund following heavy withdrawals after the referendum on the UK's exit from the European Union.

In August 2017, Prudential plc (the parent company of M&G Investments) announced it would merge M&G Investments with its Prudential UK and Europe businesses to form a new division. The division would be called M&GPrudential, which the firm described as a savings and investments business. Then in August 2019 it announced that it would de-merge the investment business as "M&G plc". The de-merger was completed in October 2019.

In December 2019, M&G was forced to gate a £2.5 billion property fund after liquidity was challenged. The company said it was due to Brexit and Election uncertainty.


### 2020–2021

In 2020, it announced its intention to acquire Ascentric, a digital wealth management platform, from its competitor Royal London. In August 2021, M&G acquired Sandringham Financial Partners. Sandringham will be part of M&G Wealth. The acquisition will bring more than £2.5 billion of assets under advice to M&G plc.
