Winchester Savings Bank


# Winchester Savings Bank



The **Winchester Savings Bank** is a bank headquartered at 661 Main Street in Winchester, Massachusetts.

The bank is an independent, mutual, state-chartered institution with a mission of meeting the financial needs of the communities which it serves. The bank is directed by a board of trustees elected by the bank's corporators, a group of civic-minded, local individuals. Since the Bank is mutual, all profits from operations are reinvested in the bank.


## History

The Winchester Savings Bank was established by the Massachusetts Legislature and incorporated on March 3, 1871. The first meeting of the Corporators was held in Lyceum Hall (the building at the corner of Main and Mt. Vernon Streets in Winchester) on July 11, 1871. The Bank first opened its doors for business on August 26, 1871, in a banking room on the north side of Main Street. It was generally predicted that the Bank would not be a success, but on opening day, $11,058 was deposited, with most of this total coming from the bank's trustees and corporators.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The bank's main office was moved on December 10, 1979, to its present location at 661 Main Street. Since its founding in 1871, the bank has grown into a full-service financial institution.
