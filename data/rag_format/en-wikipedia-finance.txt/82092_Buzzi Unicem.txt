# Buzzi Unicem



**Buzzi S.p.A.** is an Italian company, quoted on the Borsa Italiana, which produces cement, ready-mix concrete, and construction aggregates. Its headquarters are in the town of Casale Monferrato which was once known as the Italian 'cement capital'. Today it has subsidiaries, interests and operations in Italy, Luxembourg, Germany, Algeria and Eastern Europe as well as in North America.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ

The company was formed in September 1999 when *Buzzi Cementi* (founded as Fratelli Buzzi SpA in Trino by the brothers Pietro and Antonio Buzzi in 1907) took over *Unicem* (founded as *Cementi Marchino* in Casale by Luigi Marchino in 1878), and took on the name *Buzzi Unicem*.

The company was founded by a large family connected to the successful Italian fencer, Lorenzo Buzzi.


## Growth through acquisition

In 2004 the group acquired control of the German cement company *Dyckerhoff* (founded as *Portland-Cement-Fabrik Dyckerhoff & Söhne* in Amöneburg by Wilhelm Gustav Dyckerhoff and his sons in 1864). In March 2018, Buzzi Unicem acquired the German firm *Portlandzementwerke Seibel & Söhne* through the *Dyckerhoff* subsidiary.

In September 2018, Buzzi Unicem revealed that it had acquired 50% of Brazil's *BCPAR* (owned by *Grupo Ricardo Brannand*), which includes two cement plants in the country, with an option to acquire the rest of the firm by 2025. This acquisition was made at a relatively low cost, likely at a loss for the seller, due to the precarious financial situation facing the Brazilian construction industry at the time. In November 2018, Buzzi Unicem was one of thirty companies that formed the advocacy group *Global Cement and Concrete Association*, as a partial replacement for the *Cement Sustainability Initiative*.

As of 2018,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the company had sales in, at least, the Czech Republic, Germany (through *Dyckerhoff*), Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the United States (through *Buzzi Unicem USA*).


## Buzzi

The year 2023 was marked by the company’s name change from Buzzi Unicem SpA to Buzzi SpA, marking a new stage in the company's history. A change initiated at the beginning of the year with the revision of the corporate structure in Italy, which led to the establishment of Buzzi Unicem Srl, and aimed at more clearly identifying the role of the parent company as the legal entity responsible for the ownership, management and coordination of all Italian and foreign subsidiaries.

In October 2024, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% of NCPAR from Grupo Ricardo Brennand, consolidating its presence in Brazil, where it has operated since 2018.

In the same year, Buzzi finalized the sale of its assets in Ukraine to CRH.
