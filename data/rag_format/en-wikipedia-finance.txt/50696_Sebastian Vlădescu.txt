## Controversies

In 2018 he was arrested for taking bribes linked to a railway contract. He denies the charges, but brought 3 kilograms of gold worth €110,000 EUR and an additional €315,000 in cash to bail himself on corruption charges. The bail procedure was recently introduced in the Romanian penal code and represents an alternative to preventive arrest. Since the procedure came into force in 2014, this is the first time a bail was partially or fully redeemed in gold, according to the DNA website.

For the rest of the €1 million sum, Mr.Vladescu offered real-estate guarantees. The valuables were deposited in an account belonging to the National Anticorruption Directorate according to the institution's press releases.
