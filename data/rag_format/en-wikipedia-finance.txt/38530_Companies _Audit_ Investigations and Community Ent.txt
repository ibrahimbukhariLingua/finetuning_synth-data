Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004


# Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004



The **Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004** (c 27), sometimes called **CAICE**, is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that regulates certain practices in financial record keeping and reporting for companies.

In 2005 and 2013, Mäntysaari and McLaughlin said this Act is important. It is comparable to the US Sarbanes–Oxley Act.

The following consultation documents and reports are precursors of this Act:

* The "Final Report of the Co-ordinating Group on Audit and Accounting Issues" to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, published in January 2003
* "Review of the Regulatory Regime of the Accountancy Profession: Legislative Proposals", published in March 2003, and the "Report on the public consultation and the Government's conclusions", published in February 2004
* The consultation document "Company Investigations: Powers for the 21st Century" published in October 2001
* The consultation document "Enterprise for Communities: proposals for a Community Interest Company", published in March 2003, and the "Report on the public consultation and the Government's intentions", published in October 2003
* The consultation document "Director and Auditor Liability" published in December 2003
