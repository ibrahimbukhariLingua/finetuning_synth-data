Konventionsfuß


# Konventionsfuß



A ***Konventionsfuß*** ("convention standard", lit.: "convention foot") was a coinage standard established by state treaty, the convention. The first one was between Austria and a number of German states of the Holy Roman Empire in the mid-18th century. This Convention determined that 20 *gulden* or 10 *Speziesthaler* (i.e. 1 Thaler = 2 Austrian *gulden*) be minted from a single Cologne mark of fine silver. Since the Cologne *mark* weighed approximately 233 g (with regional variants), one *gulden* had a fine weight of 11.69 g of silver.

The money minted to this standard was called the Convention *thaler* (*Konventionsthaler*) or Convention coin (*Konventionsmünze*). This designation was retained even after the states that had been party to the Convention, with the exception of Austria, had switched to a different standard.


## History

Austria had left the Leipzig standard (at 12 *thalers* or 18 *gulden* to a fine *mark*) in 1747 and from July 1748 had initially minted *thalers* to a standard of 19 *gulden* 3⅓ *kreuzers* but, on 7 November 1750, went over to a 20-*gulden* standard and called the new two-*gulden* piece, the *thaler* (*Taler*). To enlarge and secure its currency area, Austria concluded another treaty convention with Bavaria on 20 September 1753, which also introduced the *20-gulden* standard to Bavaria; this has since been called the Convention standard (*Konventionsfuß*). Saxony and many other German imperial circles and estates also introduced the Convention standard. However, Bavaria withdrew from the treaty before the end of a year and switched to the 24-*gulden* standard.

The last south German Convention coin was minted in 1838. In Austria, the Convention standard expired in 1857 with the Vienna Minting Treaty, which saw the introduction of the *Vereinsthaler* of 1½ *gulden*).
