The Firm season 1


# The Firm season 1



***The Firm*** is Malaysia's first corporate reality television programme produced by Popiah Pictures and ntv7. Hosted by **Peter Pek** and **Chan Boon Yong**, the show is directed by award-winning director **Ng Ping Ho** of *Kopitiam* fame.

In season one of *The Firm*, a group of 10 professionals compete in an elimination-style competition to find the next corporate high-flyer. The winner gets attractive prizes as well as a one-year contract with **Tune Money**, Asia's first "no-frills" online financial service founded by Dato' Tony Fernandes (founder of budget airline, **AirAsia**). In addition to Pek and Chan, the other judge on the show is **Tengku Zafrul Aziz**, making it the only television show in Malaysia to have three millionaire judges.

The show attempts to separate the weak from the strong, the under-achievers from the over-achievers and the followers from the leaders. Each week, candidates compete in a series of tasks dealing with different disciplines in business that is imperative to the success of a corporate high-flier. Amongst others, these include branding, promotions, positioning and catering to target markets. The catch phrase used in the show is "You're terminated". The show premièred prime time on ntv7 on 24 June 2007. Season one of the series was presented by Intel Core 2 Duo, and the official radio station was Fly FM.


## Hosts/Judges

The Firm has two corporate leaders, and a CEO, who all judge the candidates at different stages:

* **Peter Pek** – renowned brand guru, writer, columnist, editor, publisher, designer, creative director, public speaker, and head of Malaysia's largest branding agency, **Brand Mercatus**.
* **Chan Boon Yong** – entrepreneur and founder of **The Carat Club**, a diamond retailer.
