## Rewards card

In 2016 Checkers tested the Xtra Savings card subsequently shelving it until its launch in late 2019. This programme allows customers to sign-up for a card which they will then need to swipe with each purchase. Unlike other rewards programmes, customers are rewarded with instant savings on purchases instead of points to spend later. Checkers claims that use of the card could result in up to 25% savings and early access to certain sales. There are some public questions about whether the savings are real. This is because discounted prices have been compared with other shop's normal prices. These comparisons seem to indicate that Checkers advertised savings have been exaggerated.
