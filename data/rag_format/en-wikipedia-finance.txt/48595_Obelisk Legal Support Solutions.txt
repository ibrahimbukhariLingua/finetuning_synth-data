Obelisk Legal Support Solutions


# Obelisk Legal Support Solutions



**Obelisk Legal Support Solutions**, usually known as *Obelisk Support*, is an alternative legal service provider of more than 1300 lawyers in London.

Obelisk Support uses a flexible 'outsourcing' working model where lawyers work remotely for the client, either on stand-by or as supporting legal advisers. Lawyers are placed with City law firms or in-house on an interim basis, and work as an extension within a business. Obelisk Support uses former city solicitors, many of them women who may enjoy a more flexible schedule (e.g. to raise a family). Obelisk Support also provides a language facility which uses qualified lawyers to translate legal documents into 27 world languages.


## History and development

Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, (former president of The Law Society and the current House of Lords Commissioner for Standards), noted the exodus of women solicitors leaving the profession to have children and argued that the situation will only change if the legal sector invests in targeted career development support for women.

Obelisk Support was founded by Dana Denis-Smith in 2010 to aid both women and men, who take time out of law to have a family. The company was founded on the idea of flexible work in law.

The name of the company was inspired by Cleopatra's Needle in London.

Paul Owers, a partner at private-equity firm Actis and an Obelisk client, documents Obelisk Support’s ethical mission of providing flexible working solutions to professional women and men who take time off work for personal and family reasons. He notes, however, that there is a challenge in promoting the model from a business perspective, given the legal sector’s traditionally conservative approach to innovation in the market.

In 2014, Obelisk Support recorded a revenue growth of 400%. In March 2017, Obelisk Support signed a deal with Linklaters to use its pool of flexible lawyers to provide an additional staffing resource.

Obelisk Support provides legal support to 35 FTSE 100 companies, including Barclays, BT, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, ING, Intel and Vodafone.

## First 100 Years Project
