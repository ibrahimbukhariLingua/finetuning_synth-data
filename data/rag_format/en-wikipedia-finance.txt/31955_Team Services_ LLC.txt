Team Services, LLC


# Team Services, LLC



**Team Services, LLC** is a Rockville, Maryland-based sports marketing firm. Founded in 2002, Team Services had early success with the sale of the naming rights to the stadium of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, which was sold to M&T Bank in 2003. M&T Bank signed a 15-year, $75 million contract with the Ravens, which was brokered by Team Services. The two principals of Team Services, Fred Fried and E.J. Narcise have a long history in sports marketing, with many successes in the naming rights field.


## Naming rights

Team Services seeks potential naming rights companies regionally, nationally and internationally. Some of the naming rights agreements that they have negotiated are:


### KFC YUM! Center

The home to men's and women's basketball for the University of Louisville, the naming rights agreement for the KFC YUM! Center is considered one of the premier naming rights agreements in sports due to the local ties of the company and the marketing opportunities present in the arena. The 10-year, $13.5 million agreement began in 2010 with the opening of the arena.


### FedEx Field

Home to the NFL's Washington Redskins, Team Services sold the naming rights of the stadium to the FedEx corporation in November 1999 for $205 million over 25 years. The agreement was important for the Memphis, Tennessee-based company as it gained them access to Washington, D.C.'s network of foreign embassies and international diplomats with which they could increase their global customer base. At the time of the agreement, it was the most lucrative naming rights agreement in sports history.


### M&T Bank Stadium

Home to the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, Team Services secured M&T Bank as the naming rights partner for the stadium in 2003 with a 15-year, $75 million agreement. Before the agreement, M&T Bank did not rank in the top-18 banks in name recognition within the Baltimore marketplace. After the agreement, M&T Bank moved up to third in aided and unaided awareness.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
