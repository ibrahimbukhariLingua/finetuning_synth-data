With the motto "Trust In You", the central role of trust for the further development of the digital economy was discussed, because trust is essential in many aspects: Companies need the trust of users in order to offer products and services successfully. At the same time, they have to trust their employees to master the digital challenges. Users, on the other hand, must be able to rely on the digital economy to treat their data with respect and responsibility. All in all, the entire digital industry needs the confidence of the society that digitalization brings more advantages than disadvantages for people.

The number of speakers rose to 600 in 2019, 35 percent of them female. Among the speakers were Stephanie Buscemi (Chief Marketing Officer Salesforce), Jimmy Wales (founder of Wikipedia), Ryan Leslie (Chief Executive Officer SuperPhone), Sir Martin Sorrell (founder of WPP), Sabina Jeschke (Board Member Digitalization and Technology Deutsche Bahn), Brennan Jacoby (founder of Philosophy at Work), Roger McNamee (founder of Elevation Partners, former facebook investor), Piera Gelardi (founder of Refinery29) and Charlotte Roche (presenter, producer, actress, radio play speaker and author).

In 2019, the new DMEXCO App, which not only enabled electronic ticketing, but could also be used for networking by visitors and exhibitors throughout the year, was in use for the first time.

In order to partially compensate the CO₂ pollution caused by the arrival of visitors, DMEXCO started the reforestation project DMEXCO Forest together with the Social Business Treedom. In Kenya, trees will be planted to store around one million kilograms of CO₂ in the future. Another sponsor of the campaign was the SaaS company Productsup.
