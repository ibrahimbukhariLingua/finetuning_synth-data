Simon Business School


# Simon Business School



**Simon Business School** (formerly known as the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration) is the business school of the University of Rochester. It is located on the university's River Campus in Rochester, New York. It was renamed in 1986 after William E. Simon (1927–2000), the 63rd United States Secretary of the Treasury. The school's current dean is Sevin Yeltekin.

Simon Business School offers full-time, part-time, and executive Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs (based in either Rochester or Switzerland), as well as Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs.


## History

The University of Rochester started as a small business program in 1958, and awarded its first MBA degree in 1962, but the School's impact in the business world can be traced to a later decision by then University President W. Allen Wallis to create a first-class business school in Rochester. In 1964, he was recruited as dean.

William H. Meckling - who would remain dean for 19 years - was a noted economist known for his analysis and leadership in support of an all-volunteer U.S. armed service. As dean, he committed the school to an economics-based approach to problem solving, recruited a faculty for researches at school, initiated new finance and accounting journals that incorporated economics, eliminated boundaries between functional departments, and transformed what had been a small, undergraduate and evening business school into a graduate business program.

As a result of work by Meckling and Michael C. Jensen - one of the faculty members he recruited - and other faculty members, the school became known for its contributions to the areas of finance, accounting, and organizational theory. The faculty's contributions, in turn, helped shape the research agenda of a generation of business scholars around the world, influencing teaching in graduate business programs and changing how many companies and executives in the US and abroad conduct business.

In 1986, another milestone in the school's history occurred when the school was renamed to the "William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration". William E. Simon, a financial entrepreneur and former U.S. Treasury Secretary, believed in the principles and ideals of the school. He offered his name and an enduring financial commitment to the school's continued success. He chaired the Executive Advisory Committee from its inception in 1986 until his death in June 2000.

Today, Sevin Yeltekin, who succeeded Andrew Ainslie in 2020, serves as dean of Simon Business School. Yeltekin, the first woman to lead the Simon School, previously served as senior associate dean and professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.
