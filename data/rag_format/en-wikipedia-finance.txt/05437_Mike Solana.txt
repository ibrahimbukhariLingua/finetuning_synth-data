# Mike Solana



**Michael Solana** (born 1985) is an American venture capitalist and marketing executive. He is the chief marketing officer of Founders Fund, and owner of the digital media outlet *Pirate Wires*.


## Early life and education

Michael Solana was born in Toms River, New Jersey, where he was raised. His grandmother was an immigrant from Spain and his father was a veteran of the Vietnam War. He attended Boston University.


## Career

After graduating university, Solana interned at Farrar, Straus and Giroux and then worked as an editorial assistant at Penguin Books' occult imprint TarcherPenguin under editor Mitch Horowitz. Solana met Peter Thiel in 2009 while volunteering for The Seasteading Institute and eventually relocated to San Francisco to work at Thiel's venture capital firm Founders Fund as its chief marketing officer.

In 2020, he started a podcast, *Problematic*, and shortly thereafter an email newsletter, *Pirate Wires*. Backed by Founders Fund, *Pirate Wires* expanded with the hiring of several full-time reporters and, according to *Business Insider*, moved from email to "a splashy website reminiscent of *Vice*". The coverage of *Pirate Wires* has been described as "left-critical," and Solana has been called Thiel's protégé.

In 2022, and in subsequent years, Solana has organized Hereticon, an annual Founders Fund-backed conference that *Reason* described as something that was "focused on ideas and arguments that have largely been shut out of mainstream discourse".

In 2024, his interview with Jack Dorsey, in which Dorsey revealed why he departed Bluesky's board, drew widespread media coverage.


## Personal life

Solana lives in Miami, Florida. He sits on the board of directors of the Foundation for American Innovation.
