Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe


# Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe



The **Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe** is a biennial high-level conference on Sino-European economic relations held in Hamburg. The Hamburg Chamber of Commerce initiated the first "Hamburg Summit" in 2004 to set up a platform for an open dialogue between Europe and China and to improve their economic relations.


## History

In discussions between the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, mayors of Hamburg and the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce Commerce the idea was born to organise a conference in Hamburg to intensify the economic and political dialogue between Europe and China and improve the economic relationship.
Hamburg as venue for the conference was a consequential choice because of the strong economic relations between the hanseatic city and the People's Republic of China. With more than 550 companies from China Hamburg is one of Europe's most important locations for Chinese companies. In addition to port-oriented companies (COSCO, China Shipping) Hamburg also hosts European headquarters of Chinese industrial companies (Baosteel, Sinosteel) or Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC). With the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the two largest Chinese banks are also represented in Hamburg. On the other side over 700 Hamburg companies maintain business relations with China. For Northern, Central and Eastern Europe Hamburg has a central role in business with China, as Hamburg is the transit station for most of the imports from China and a distribution center for onward transport to the new EU accession countries, but also to Russia and Western and Southern Europe. Indeed, about one third of the container traffic in the port of Hamburg is related to China.

## Content

The "Hamburg Summit" brings together leaders from politics, business and academics, who will discuss current issues and challenges for the Sino-European economic dialogue. Especially in times of the global economic crisis that erupted immediately after the "Hamburg Summit" in 2008 or the current sovereign debt crisis forums such as the "Hamburg Summit" are important to maintain the dialogue with China on a politically neutral level or even to intensify.

Recurring themes in the "Hamburg Summit" are the roles of China and Europe in the global economy, trade relations between China and the EU, bilateral investments between the EU and China the energy and raw material supply, sustainability issues and environmental protection. It is not just about the big theoretical questions but also about concrete solutions such as "Smart City" concepts.

Two prizes are awarded as part of the “Hamburg Summit” – the China-Europe Friendship Award, which in 2014 went to the China Federation of Industrial Economics (CFIE) and in 2016 to Gerhard Schröder, former chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. The second award is the China-Europe Sustainability Award. The latter went in 2014 to BMW China and in 2016 to the Chint Group.
