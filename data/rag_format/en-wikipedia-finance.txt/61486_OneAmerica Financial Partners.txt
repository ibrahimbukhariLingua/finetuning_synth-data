## History

Started as a life insurance group in 1877 by the Knights of Pythias, it became American Central Life Insurance Company in 1899. In 1904, American Central Life Insurance Company established its Reinsurance Division, which as of 2015 is the oldest life reinsurance company in the U.S. In 1930, Knights of Pythias separated the insurance program, creating United Mutual Life Insurance Company Inc. Then, in 1936, American Central and United Mutual merged to form American United Life Insurance Company (AUL).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1957, American United Life Insurance Company started posting puns and funny sayings on a signboard in downtown Indianapolis, a tradition that has continued to the present.

In 1982, AUL moved into the AUL Tower, the tallest building completed in Indianapolis at the time. A longtime supporter of downtown Indianapolis redevelopment, OneAmerica was an investor in Circle Centre Mall.

In 1994, the State Life Insurance Company joined AUL, as did the Pioneer Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1998. In 2000, AUL reorganized to form American United Mutual Insurance Holding Company and OneAmerica Financial Partners Inc.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2010, OneAmerica purchased McCready and Keene, Inc. In 2014, OneAmerica purchased City National Bank's retirement services division.

In 2015, OneAmerica purchased Bank of Montreal's BMO Retirement Services.

In 2024, OneAmerica announced a "brand refresh", including an updated logo and the company's first national advertising campaign doing business as OneAmerica Financial.
