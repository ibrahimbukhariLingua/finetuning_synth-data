## History

Nanjing University Business School dates back to the courses of economics and commerce provided after education reform in 1902, during which period the faculty member of the school included the cultural academic leader Liu Yizheng (柳詒徵), who is the author of the first book of *The History of Chinese Commerce* and *Business Ethics*. The faculty of commerce (or business) was founded in 1917 at Nanking Higher Normal School which transformed to be National Southeastern University in 1921. The first dean was Yang Hsingfo (Yang Xingfo, 楊杏佛), who is a pioneering scholar of modern management in China.

Then in 1921 the commerce faculty was moved to Shanghai and extended to become the business school of National Southeastern University with the name Shanghai Commerce College, initially with six departments including General Commerce, Business Administration, Accounting, Banking & Financing, International Trade, and International Transportation. It's the first modern professional university business school conferring degrees in China. National Southeastern University renamed National Central University in 1928 and again in 1949 renamed Nanjing University. National Central University business school became independent with the name National Shanghai College of Commerce in 1932 and later became Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. In the meantime, there was the Department of Economics under the division of social sciences in the main campus of Nanking, which was originated in 1921 and the first director was Hsiao Chunchin (Xiao Chunjin, 蕭純錦). In 1945 there were three groups at the Economics Department: economic theory and policy, public finance, banking and finance. The department was merged to Fudan University in 1952 during the college and department adjustment by PRC government.

Nanjing University reestablished faculties of economics and business management after 1978. Those faculties formed the International Business School of Nanjing University in 1988, and in 2000 the school was renamed Nanjing University Business School and at the time the school had five departments: Business Administration, Accounting, Finance, Economics, and International Economics & Trade. In 2006 the business school was divided into two collaborative interdependent sub-schools: School of Economics, comprising Departments of Economics, Finance, Industrial Economics, and International Economics & Trade, and School of Management, comprising Departments of Business Administration, Accounting, Marketing, Human Resources Management, etc.

NUBS launched MBA (Master of Business Administration) training project firstly in 1987 and started MBA education in Singapore in 1993. NUBS MBA program in Nanjing main campus start in 1994. In 1995, National MBA Entrance Examination Research Center was established at NUBS, the director of the center who was the dean of NUBS Zhou Sanduo (周三多) led a team to work out the MBA entrance examination blueprint GRK which was put into effect in 1997 and since then MBA candidates need to take part in the nationwide united MBA Entrance Exam.
