Tourism in Iceland


# Tourism in Iceland

 

**Tourism in Iceland** has grown considerably in economic significance in the past 15 years. As of 2016, the tourism industry is estimated to contribute about 10 percent to the Icelandic GDP; the number of foreign visitors exceeded 2,000,000 for the first time in 2017; tourism is responsible for a share of nearly 30 percent of the country's export revenue.


## History

Services provided to foreign tourists were for a long time an insignificant part of the Icelandic economy, rarely contributing more than 2 percent to GDP, even long after the advent of international air travel. Until the early 1980s, the number of foreign visitors to Iceland increased slowly and erratically, never exceeding 80,000 in a single year, and for many years after that only barely kept pace with the increase in the number of Icelanders travelling to and from the country. This situation lasted until the turn of the century, when the annual number of visitors exceeded the total resident population for the first time, at around 300,000.

A few years later the Icelandic tourism industry started to experience a boom which to this day shows no signs of abating, as witnessed by the fact that the number of foreign visitors grew on average by 6 percent per year between 2003 and 2010, and by some 20 percent per year on average between 2010 and 2014. In 2015, this rapid increase has continued, with the number of foreign visitors already exceeding 1 million in the period January to October. According to the Icelandic Tourist Board, the total number of overnight stays by foreign visitors to Iceland grew from 595,000 in 2000 to 2.1 million in 2010, before rising to 4.4 million in 2014.

The number of people working in tourism-related industries in Iceland was 21,600 in 2014, representing nearly 12 percent of the total workforce, and tourism's direct contribution to GDP is now close to 5 percent.


## Tourist demographics

Iceland is well known for its untouched nature and unique atmosphere.
Iceland receives the highest number of tourists during summer (June–August). In 2014, around 42% of visitors arrived in Iceland during its summer months, proportionally a slight decrease compared to the previous two years, the percentage of winter visitors having increased by over 4% in the same period. As of year 2014, Iceland's largest tourism markets comprises tourists from Central/South Europe, followed by those from other regions: North America, the UK, then the Nordic countries. In terms of visitors from individual countries, the top five for 2014 were the UK, USA, Germany, France and Norway. Canada had the largest percentage increase in visitor numbers in the 2013-2014 period, with an increase of over 60% year on year.


## Overtourism in Iceland

Overtourism in Iceland is a result of both the huge rise in visitor arrivals, and their concentration in a small area of the country. Over 98% of visitors to Iceland come through Keflavik, just 45 minutes from Reykjavik, with many using the city as a short stopover on a transatlantic flight and restricting their travel to popular nearby sites like the Blue Lagoon and the Golden Circle.

This tourism boom, centred around Reykjavik and the south, has been problematic:

* Hotel rooms in Reykjavik have not kept pace with visitor numbers, rising by 42% and 264% respectively over the same period. Short term rental sites like Airbnb have plugged the gap, increasing residential property prices, pushing local people out of central Reykjavik, and shifting downtown amenities towards tourists rather than residents.
* In the small town of Akureyri, which saw a 91% increase in cruise ship arrivals between 2015 and 2019, economic benefits have not increased in line with the increase in cruise passengers. Local cafes saw just a 3.5% increase in business during a cruise ship visit, and restaurants just a 1% increase.
* Local facilities and major tourism sites are struggling to cope with increased visitor numbers. Hiking trails are being degraded, roads now routinely used by tourist buses are deteriorating, and visitors regularly damage fragile ecosystems – like the moss that covers Thingvellir National Park.
