Milla de Oro


# Milla de Oro



**Milla de Oro** (English for *Golden Mile*) is both the popular name given to the main central business district of San Juan and a nickname given to the sections of Juan Ponce de León Avenue and *Luis Muñoz Rivera Avenue* that cross Hato Rey Norte from north to south. It encompasses the largest agglomeration of corporate investment, banking and finance institutions in the Caribbean. The headquarters of Puerto Rico's largest retail investment bank, Popular, Inc., are located at *Popular Center* in *208 Juan Ponce de León Ave*. *La Milla de Oro* is served by the Tren Urbano stations of Hato Rey, Roosevelt, Domenech and Piñero stations in addition to numerous bus routes with connections to Río Piedras, Plaza Las Américas, Santurce and Old San Juan.

## Plans

Milla de Oro has received criticism from nearby communities for its lonely and dark environment after work hours. In order to foster tourism and economic growth in the area, the government has planned to convert the district into a more community friendly sector by attracting tourists, visitors, and local residents to the district during after hours through concerts, retail shops, and nightspots.

The first phase of this conversion was to locate the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum and several Tren Urbano metro system stations in the district. Banco Popular recently inaugurated a new project near its headquarters called *Arts Cinemas at Popular Cente*r for exhibiting foreign and independent films and a deli-café. New residential apartments and a 31-story high commercial complex near the Coliseum are being developed in the area as well.


## Milla de Oro in popular culture

The *Milla de Oro* was heavily featured in the Calle 13 2010 musical video for "Calma Pueblo". The song features lead singer, Residente, singing on top of a building while businessmen and random people run around the Milla de Oro, eventually getting naked.

The *Milla de Oro* was also featured in the film *Fast Five* during one of the heists.
