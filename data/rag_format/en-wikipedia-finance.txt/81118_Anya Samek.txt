## Work

Samek's work on various economics topics, including charitable giving, education, and health, includes over 100 academic publications.


### Charitable giving

Samek's work in charitable giving, among other topics, looks at what affects the decisions of donors in the act of giving.


#### Social pressure effect

Samek and Chuan explored how the manipulation of allowing a donor to give a card along with their donation, an act meant to add meaning to the transaction, affects their giving rates. It was discovered that this manipulation caused a social pressure effect as "small donors feel that they should be donating more" and thus refrains them from donating all together.


#### Selective recognition

In 2013, Samek and Sheremeta investigated how the act of recognizing donors affects the extent of contributions to public goods. They found that recognizing all or solely the lowest donors significantly increases contributions, while recognizing the highest donors has no effect on the extent of contribution at all. It was concluded from the study that "aversion from shame" is more powerful than "anticipation of prestige".


### Education

Among other papers, Samek's work analyzes how different modes of education can effect early childhood learning and adult financial decision-making.


#### Improving financial literacy

Samek, along with Lusardi, Kapteyn, Glinert, Hung, and Heinberg, evaluated different mediums of educational programs aimed at to educate adults about risk diversification. The work cites risk diversification as an "essential concept for financial decision-making". Their research found that videos are the most effective means of communicating financial literacy, which highlighted the power of online media in educating and altering the decisions of recipients.


#### Academic achievement gap

In 2012, Samek helped launch a large-scale project called the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center (CHECC). Samek and a team of scholars sought to understand the academic achievement gap and how early childhood education interventions may reduce it. The research found that preschool programs and incentives to parents lead to large reductions in the academic achievement gap.

Samek said this about her work at CHECC:

> The CHECC results not only allow us to provide quality early childhood education but also help inform us about how to most effectively develop early childhood programs. We are excited to move forward as we continue to provide the Chicago Heights community quality early childhood programming.


### Health

Samek's work on health includes examination of the effects of interventions in the decision-making of children in regards to food choice.


#### Prompts

Over several weeks, Samek, List, and Lai ran an experiment aimed at better understanding how prompts affect the food-choice of children. They discovered that when nudges by cafeteria workers are applied, children are more likely to opt for white milk relative to sugar-sweetened chocolate milk.


#### Individual incentives and educational messaging

Samek and List analyzed how individual incentives and educational messaging affect the food choice of children. They discovered that when the two interventions were applied in tandem, they held an important influence in increasing the rate at which children opt for healthier snacks. Notably, the research showed that the effects of the experiment continued to spill over after its completion, suggesting that individual incentives and education messaging encourages habit-building among children.
