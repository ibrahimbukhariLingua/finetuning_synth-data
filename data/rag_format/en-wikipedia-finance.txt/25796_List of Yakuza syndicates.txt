*Yakuza* (Japanese: ヤクザ, [jaꜜkɯza]), also known as gokudō (極道, "the extreme path"), are members of transnational organized crime syndicates originating in Japan.


## Syndicates


### Four largest syndicates

Although yakuza membership has declined following an anti-gang law aimed specifically at yakuza and passed by the Japanese government in 1992, there are thought to be about 20,400 active yakuza members in Japan today.

| Principal families | Description | Mon (crest) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yamaguchi-gumi (六代目山口組, *Rokudaime Yamaguchi-gumi*) | The Yamaguchi-gumi is the largest yakuza family, with about 8,200 members. | "Yamabishi" (山菱) |

| Inagawa-kai (稲川会) | The Inagawa-kai is the third-largest yakuza family in Japan, with roughly 3,300 members. It is based in the Tokyo-Yokohama area and was one of the first yakuza families to expand its operations outside of Japan. |
| Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi (神戸山口組, *Kōbe-Yamaguchi-gumi*) | The Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi is the fourth-largest yakuza family, with 3,000 members. They are a splinter group who broke away from the Yamaguchi-gumi family in 2015. |


### Designated bōryokudan

A designated boryokudan (指定暴力団, *Shitei Bōryokudan*) is a "particularly harmful" yakuza group registered by the Prefectural Public Safety Commissions under the Organized Crime Countermeasures Law (暴力団対策法, *Bōryokudan Taisaku Hō*) enacted in 1991.

The numbers that follow the names of bōryokudan groups refer to the group's leadership. For example, Yoshinori Watanabe headed the Yamaguchi-gumi *fifth*; on his retirement, Shinobu Tsukasa became head of the Yamaguchi-gumi *sixth*, and "Yamaguchi-gumi VI" is the group's formal name.
