## Family

Hubertus Count von Faber-Castell was son to two German dynasties. His father, Roland Count von Faber-Castell, was sole owner of today's Faber-Castell AG. On his maternal side, Alix-May von Frankenberg and Ludwigsdorf, belonged to the owning family of Europe's biggest private bank Sal. Oppenheim Jr. & Cie. Count Hubertus briefly worked in both family businesses. After a dispute with his father, he left the Faber-Castell family holdings and sold most of his stake in the company to his younger brother. From there on, the Franconian stationery manufacturer was managed by his younger brother Anton-Wolfgang Count von Faber-Castell. Count Hubertus was silent owner at the Faber-Castell Company, as well as the bank Sal. Oppenheim. The combined stakes in the two corporations, made him a billionaire. Hubertus had three children from two different marriages:

* Patrick Count von Faber-Castell, husband of the German actress Mariella Ahrens from his first marriage.
* German-Swiss Caroline Countess von Faber-Castell-Gotzens from his first marriage.
* Floria-Franziska Princess von Hessen is married to the Head of the House of Hesse, Donatus from his second marriage.

Count Hubertus was publicly titled by the government as 'great friend of China', later the Count was honored to be the first European honorary citizen of the city of Beijing.
