## Company Affairs

The company was the first pan-European DSP. A Series B round of funding for US$5.5 million was closed in early 2014 followed by a 150 million Danish Kroner (US$21.5 million) investment by Danica Pension in late 2015. In 2018 an IPO was announced, but later postponed due to uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets at that time. In April 2019, Adform received an external investment from GRO Capital for an undisclosed amount. In April 2020, Troels Philip Jensen replaced Gustav Mellentin as CEO of Adform.
