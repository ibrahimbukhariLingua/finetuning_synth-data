Energy Transition Minerals


# Energy Transition Minerals



**Energy Transition Minerals Ltd** (formerly **Greenland Minerals Limited,** ASX Code: ETM) is an ASX-listed company focused on the exploration, development and financing of minerals that are critical to a low carbon future. The company’s current projects include the Kvanefjeld, located in Greenland, Villasrubias, located in Spain, and two Lithium projects located in the James Bay region in Canada.


## Kvanefjeld project

The Kvanefjeld project is located near the southwest of Greenland consisting of multi-element deposit including rare-earth elements (REE), zinc, and uranium, within marginal phases of the ilimaussaq intrusive complex. As at February 2015, the project has defined a total resource of 673 Mt @ 10,900 ppm TREO, 248 ppm U3O8, 10,000 ppm REO, 881 ppm Y2O3, 2,270 ppm Zn which contained 7.34 Mt TREO, 368 Mlbs U3O8, 1.53 Mt Zn using 150 ppm U3O8 cut-off. The project shows higher grade portions located close to the ground surface. ETM aims to produce light and heavy RE concentrates, zinc concentrate, uranium concentrate, large-scale output, and long life of mine in the project area.


## 2021 Greenlandic general election

The company's plans became a significant political issue in the 2021 Greenlandic general election. The Inuit Ataqatigiit party called for a moratorium on uranium mining, putting into question the wider rare earth mining project, whilst the Siumut party voiced support, citing economic growth as a key reason. In a survey to determine the public opinion on mining in the Kvanefjeld deposit, 63% opposed such activity, of which 45% were very much against.


## Villarubias Project

The Villarubias project is located in the southwest corner of the province of Salamanca close to the Portuguese border and 33 km away from Ciudad Rodrigo, the district capital. The project consists of a permit of investigation (11.4 km²) acquired by Technology Metals Europe SL in 2021. The main target is a set of lithium-tantalum-niobium-tin-bearing aplite-pegmatite dykes. Of these minerals, the first three are critical raw materials for the EU, according to the list updated in 2020.


## Solo and Good Setting Lithium Projects

On 31 October 2023, the company announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire the Solo and Good Setting Lithium Projects in the rapidly growing James Bay region in Quebec, Canada. This marked a significant expansion in the Company's exploration asset portfolio. The James Bay region stands as a premier global hard rock lithium province with numerous active exploration projects, resources, and emerging production. Its prominence within the global lithium sector is underscored by the extent of current exploration investment and significance of discoveries.


## Chinese shareholding

In 2016, a Chinese company, Shenghe Resources became the largest shareholder in Greenland Minerals Limited with an 11% share.
