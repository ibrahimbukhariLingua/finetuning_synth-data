Fetch.AI


# Fetch.AI



**Fetch.ai** is a technology company and a semi-decentralized platform that can create agents, which are software programs (similar to smart contracts) on the Fetch platform. These agents can communicate with each other and make external API requests.


## History

Fetch.ai was founded in 2017 by a team from Cambridge, UK.

It conducted an IEO on Binance in March 2019. Fetch.ai launched its native token (FET).

In 2021, the company launched the NFT machine-learning platform for AI-generated art.

In March 2022, Fetch.ai partnered with West Ham United as the club's official artificial intelligence partner (both men's and women's teams).

In March 2023, Fetch.ai raised a $40M round led by DWF Labs.


## Overview

Fetch.ai is an open-source platform for creating agents, which are programs hosted either locally on a server or on Agentverse, Fetch's centralized hub for agents. All agents need to be registered through Almanac to communicate with each other, using Mailbox to allow locally hosted agents to communicate with the rest of the network. End users can then run scripts to interact with each Agent.

**AI Capabilities**

While Fetch is incapable of directly hosting AI models and AI chatbots on its network, it can host non-AI agents (basic web programs) on its Agentverse. These agents can then "fetch" 3rd-party AI responses using external API requests or coordinate requests between them.

One of the options for allowing agents to interpret human-readable text is to make API requests to the AI Engine service outside of the Agentverse network.

**Location**

Fetch.ai operates in the US and Europe.

The company is headquartered in Cambridge, Humayun Sheikh is the CEO and founder.
