In 1992, due to Legge Amato, the bank was split into **Cassa di Risparmio di Pescara e Loreto Aprutino S.p.A.** (*Società per Azioni*; company limited by shares) as well as Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Pescara e di Loreto Aprutino (the banking foundation; later known as Fondazione Pescara Abruzzo). Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo) immediately acquired 20% shares of the limited company, as well as fellow saving banks of Abruzzo Region: Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti and Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Teramo.
