European Confederation of Young Entrepreneurs


# European Confederation of Young Entrepreneurs



Yes for Europe is the Brussels-based **European Confederation of Young Entrepreneurs** founded in 1988 to represent young entrepreneurs in Europe. The Confederation has one member per European Country, which is a representative national association of entrepreneurs below the age of 40.

Yes for Europe was launched in 1988 by seven national groups of young entrepreneurs in order to face the challenges resulting from the ratification of the Single European Act in July 1987. Young entrepreneurs from Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal as well as from Japan and met in Capri, Italy, during the National Convention of Confindustria Giovani Imprenditori to sign the “International Young Entrepreneurs Charter”, the so-called “Capri Charter” which established the fundamental principles for the future cooperation.

Yes for Europe represents the European Union to a number of international young entrepreneurs organizations including the G20 Young Entrepreneurs Alliance and the Allied for Startups advocacy group.
