# Maisons du Monde



**Maisons du Monde** (French pronunciation: [mɛzõ dy mõd(ə)], *Houses of the world*) is a French furniture and home decor company founded in Brest in 1996 by Xavier Marie. At the end of 2015, it had nearly 250 stores across France, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, and in Switzerland, of which more than 180 are in France. In 2010, it generated nearly €323 million in sales. In 2015, it employed over 5,500 people.


## History

In 2006, Maisons du Monde launched its online shop and offered the whole of its catalogue of furniture and a large part of its objects of decoration. Maisons du Monde published a catalogue presenting its new collection at the beginning of the year.

The American business Bain Capital purchased the Maisons du Monde group in 2013 for €680 million (80%).

In 2015, it achieved a turnover of 699 million euros, of which 460 million were in France.

In February 2016, two US banks—Goldman Sachs and Citigroup—were mandated to prepare for an IPO.

In 2018, Maisons du Monde opened its first store in the United States, located in Wynwood, Florida. In 2019, Maisons du Monde opened a new store located in Aventura Mall, the third largest shopping mall in the United States.

In 2020, Maisons du Monde was hit by the Covid-19 crisis, but managed to hold its own above expectations. From January to June, sales fell by 13.3% to 489 million euros. Nevertheless, a second warehouse will open in early 2021 near the port of Le Havre to receive goods from Asia.
