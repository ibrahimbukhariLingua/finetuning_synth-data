# Rozali Ismail



**Rozali bin Ismail** is a Malaysian businessman, founder, and Executive Chairman of Puncak Niaga Holdings. He also serves as the Executive Chairman of Syarikat Bekalan Air Selangor (SYABAS), a water concession company that was nationalized by the state of Selangor in 2017. Additionally, he is the President of the Malay Business Association of Selangor (DPMMS).


## Financials

Bin Ismail was listed as one of the 40 richest men in Malaysia in 2011 with an estimated net worth of $155 million. His remuneration packages, including RM 5.1 million in 2009 and 33.4 million in 2012, drew negative public attention given the unsatisfactory level of water services in Selangor.


## Puncak Niaga

Puncak Niaga was founded by Bin Ismail in the 1990s. The company orchestrated early water concession in Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's ties to Selangor politicians enabled him to facilitate public-private partnerships and influence the decision to employ a three-stage water treatment scheme in the region.

Puncak Niaga is the parent company of SYABAS. In October 2015 both companies were taken over by the Selangor state government.

In 2018 Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor (SPLASH) filed a suit against SYABAS, claiming RM 4.22 billion in outstanding receivables. According to the chairman of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), Tan Gim Tuan, since the government took over, Syabas had reported massive annual losses every year. Tam Gim Tuan further claimed that the suit could result in state bankruptcy.


## Other positions

Rozali bin Ismail was the President of the Water Association of Selangor, Kuala Lumpur & Putrajaya and the Deputy President of the Malaysian Water Association. He was also the treasurer of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) Selangor, UMNO Hulu Selangor Division, a Selangor State Representative at the Malay Chamber of Commerce and Selangor State Representative at the Malay Chamber of Commerce.

Rozali is the adviser for the Sultan Idris Shah Polytechnics. He is the Chairman of Gabungan Wawasan Generasi Felda (GWGF)—–a group of 14 non-government organizations that speak for settlers and their families nationwide, estimated at some 600,000 people. In 2017, he was called to disclose the identity of those responsible in the land ownership transfer to reveal the identities of those involved in the suspicious RM200 million sale of Felda's land in Jalan Semarak. In 2018, bin Ismail announced that GWGF would continue to support the Barisan Nasional Party and the United Malays National Organization Government in Malaysia's 14th general election.


## Awards and recognition

He was bestowed the Socrates Awards, an award given to businessmen who contributed their ideas and experiences to the international community. Rozali Ismail is also an activist in promoting local economy, politics, education, and Malaysian culture to the world.
