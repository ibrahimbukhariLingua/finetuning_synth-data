In 1995, Vinci Airports obtained its first airport concession. A contract was signed, via its subsidiary Cambodia Airports, until 2040 for the airports of Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. Since 2006, Vinci Airports has also held the concession for a third international airport in Cambodia: Sihanoukville.

In France Vinci Airports won its first tender for Grenoble Airport in 2003, followed by a second in 2004 for Chambéry Airport.

VINCI Airports was set up in Chile in 2015. The Nuevo Pudahuel consortium, including Vinci Airports (40%), Aéroports de Paris (45%) and Astaldi (15%), took over the operation of Santiago de Chile Airport for 20 years.

It was also in 2015 that Vinci Airports and its partner Orix were appointed prospective concessionaires for Kansai and Osaka International airports for a 44-year period starting 1 April 2016.

In 2018 Vinci Airports signed the concession contract for Belgrade Airport, Serbia and officially became the concessionaire in December 2018 for a 25-year term. In April 2018, Vinci Airports announced the acquisition of Airports Worldwide, a U.S. airport concession company, and thus became concessionaire for 8 airports including Belfast International Airport, Northern Ireland, Stockholm-Skavsta Airport, Sweden, Orlando-Sanford Airport, U.S.A., and Guanacaste Airport, Costa Rica.

In December 2018 Vinci Airports reached an agreement to buy 50.01% of the shares in Gatwick Airport Limited, the company that owns London Gatwick Airport, from its current shareholders, enabling it to become the majority shareholder for €3.2 billion.

In 2021 Vinci Airports won the concession for seven new airports (Manaus, Tabatinga, Téfé, Cruzeiro do Sul, Porto Velho, Rio Branco, Boa Vista) in the Amazon region of northern Brazil, for 30 years.

In December 2022 Vinci Airports acquired 30% of OMA (Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte), the leading Mexican airport operator, which operates 13 airports in that country.
