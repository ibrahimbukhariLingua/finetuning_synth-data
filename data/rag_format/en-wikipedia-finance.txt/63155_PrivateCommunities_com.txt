# PrivateCommunities.com



**Private Communities Registry** is a privately held company which owns PrivateCommunities.com, the longest-running website providing information about master-planned communities in the United States. The website helps consumers research the lifestyle and amenities offered at hundreds of gated, golf, retirement, and vacation home communities. Each month, PrivateCommunities.com matches more than 70,000 potential home buyers with communities meeting their criteria.


## History

Vero Beach, Florida-based PrivateCommunities.com was founded in 1996 by Marie Roberts and Elisabeth Miller-Fox, both experienced real estate developers. It was the first website to present information about master-planned communities to retirement and second home buyers. Echoing growing internet use, PrivateCommunities.com jumped from 2.2 million unique visitors in 2005 to attracting 3.6 million unique visitors in 2008, even given the number of foreclosures during the U.S. Great Recession.
