## About

DCI was incorporated as a public sector company in March 1976. Companies Act 1956. It was listed on CSE and DSE stock exchanges in October 1992 and debuted on BSE on 28 February 2000. It went for an Initial public offering in March 2004. DCI engaged IHC Dredgers BV, Netherlands for design, construction and delivery of 5500 cu. m TSHD in 2011. It changed strategy to raise funds for purchasing additional dredgers by asking the seaports for investments. The capital thus raised was used to replenish its old fleet. The Government of India reduced current stake in the company by 5 percent. The offer for sale of 5 percent stake was well received by the investors. As part of its diversification plans DCI expresses interest to foray into international markets. Ex-chairman and managing director, Abraham Kuruvilla finds mention in bringing widespread reforms in the corporate management techniques at DCI. On 1 November 2017, the Government of India approved the disinvestment of Dredging Corporation of India On 8 November 2018, the Government of India approved the stake of DCI to 4 Government owned Ports. DCI has been handed over to 4 major ports viz: Vishakhapatnam Port Trust, Paradeep Port Trust, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Kandla Port Trust.
