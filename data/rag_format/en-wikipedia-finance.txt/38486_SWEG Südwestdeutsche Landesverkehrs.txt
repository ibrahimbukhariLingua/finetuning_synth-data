# SWEG Südwestdeutsche Landesverkehrs



The **Südwestdeutsche Landesverkehrs-GmbH** (SWEG), in English language *Southwest German Transport Company*, from its former name, **Südwestdeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft** (SEG), is a transport company in southwest Germany that operates railway lines and bus services. It is 100% owned by the federal state of Baden-Württemberg.
