# Iwoca



**iwoca Ltd.** (/ɪˈwɒkə/) is a British online credit financing company based in London. It offers credit facilities to small businesses trading in the UK and Germany via an automated lending platform.

iwoca provides credit lines of up to £200,000 and business loans of up to £500,000. It uses various machine learning models to automatically assess businesses based on data taken directly from Xero, eBay, Amazon, PayPal, Sage Pay, business bank accounts and other online and offline platforms. This follows a similar model to the one used by Kabbage in the United States.

The company was founded by Christoph Rieche and James Dear in October 2011 and started trading in March 2012. Initially they focused on custom-built loans to small businesses, who usually struggled with access to finance from big banks. To start with, these were exclusively e-commerce businesses, but in April 2014, iwoca began lending to all types of small businesses. By July 2015, it was reported to have seen 250% year-on-year growth in issuance.

It has also integrated its credit API with Tide bank. A 3% monthly interest rate and maximum loan term of 12 months are typical.
