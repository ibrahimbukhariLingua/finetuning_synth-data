## History

Formerly Canadian Baldwin Holdings Limited, the company changed its name to Aura Gold, with former-Yamana Gold CEO Victor Bradley as its new CEO, and listed shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2006 in order to pursue exploration of gold properties in Brazil. In 2016, the company re-located its corporate offices from Toronto to Miami, Florida and, re-incorporated under the *BVI Business Companies Act* with its headquarters in Road Town, British Virgin Islands.

Mineraçāo Apoena, a subsidiary of Aura, closed the Sāo Vicente gold mine, located in Nova Lacerda, in July 2013. The closure is due to the natural depletion of the mine. The mine started commercial production in 2009 and in the first year of operations produced 49,584 ounces of gold from 2.16 million tons of ore with a 0.43 grams of gold per tonne content.

Aura Minerals reported it 206,747 ounces of gold were produced in 2013, an increase of 20% from the 172,500 in 2012.

The Aranzazu mine, which produces copper in Mexico, had its activities suspended in January 2015. The company said it would spend the first half reviewing the development plans, costs and expenses of the project

In May 2015, Aura Minerals signed an agreement with Serra da Borda Mineraçāo e Metalurgia (SBMM), a subsidiary of Yamana Gold, to acquire the Ernesto / Pau-a-Pique gold mine, located near Pontes e Lacerda, through the issuance of shares, call options and payment of royalties on future production. The operation was approved by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) in July 2015.

In March 2018 the company completed a merger with TSX-listed Rio Novo Gold Inc in an all-stock deal with former Rio Novo shareholders forming 22% of the new Aura Minerals.
