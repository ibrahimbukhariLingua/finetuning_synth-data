# Rodeway Inn



**Rodeway Inn** is a chain of hotels in the United States and Canada. Founded by Michael Robinson in 1962, the franchise is now led by Choice Hotels corporation.

As of June 30, 2020, there are 578 Rodeway Inn locations in North America, with approximately 33,107 rooms across the continent. Each hotel is a franchise, owned and managed by a separate investor.


## History

The chain was established in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1962. Michael Robinson and his son-in-law Joe Simmons opened the chain under the name Rodeway Inns of America. In 1971, the Vantage Company of Dallas, Texas, acquired the hotel chain. Prudential Life Insurance partnered with Rodeway Inns to finance the company-owned inns with the goal of becoming a franchise. In 1976, the company began focusing exclusively on franchising. In 1985, Ladbrokes purchased the brand, and two years later sold the chain to Ramada.

In 1990, the brand became a part of the Choice Hotels corporate group, along with Friendship Inn and Econo Lodge. The Friendship Inn chain was absorbed by the Rodeway Inn and Econo Lodge brands at this time.

In 2005, Rodeway Inn, led by Division President Kevin Bradt, reorganized its franchise structure to attract franchisees to the hotel chain. In 2007, Rodeway Inn was named the fastest growing chain in the hotel industry by *Lodging Magazine*. As of 2018, Rodeway Inn is still a part of Choice Hotels International.


## Franchise fee

From 1990 to 2005, the franchise fee was structured as a revenue percentage; after that it was an annual fee per room. It costs approximately $500,000 in liquid capital to invest in a Rodeway Inn franchise. As of 2018, the franchise has a revenue percentage fee structure, similar to its sister brand, Econolodge.
