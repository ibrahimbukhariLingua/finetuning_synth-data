      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key steps in CarMax's transition from a subsidiary of Circuit City to an independent entity and how that affected its stock structure. I need to go through the provided passage and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll look for mentions of CarMax being a subsidiary of Circuit City. Sentence S3 says it began as a side business of Circuit City. Then, there's S25 and S26 about the first CarMax stock in 1997 as a tracking stock under Circuit City. The key point is the split. S27 states that CarMax officially split from Circuit City on October 1, 2002, as a stock dividend for Circuit City shareholders. That's a major step. \n\nFor the stock structure, the tracking stock part is important. Initially, the stock was a tracking stock under Circuit City (S26), and then after the split, it became independent. The split would have involved issuing shares to Circuit City shareholders, making CarMax an independent entity. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other steps mentioned. The passage doesn't talk about other steps like legal processes or specific dates beyond the 2002 split. The stock structure change is covered in S25-S27. \n\nSo the key steps are: starting as a side business, issuing tracking stock in 1997, and the 2002 spin-off. The stock structure transitioned from tracking stock under Circuit City to independent shares via a stock dividend. \n\nNow, I'll structure the answer with citations. Each sentence should have the relevant citations. Let me check the sentences again to ensure accuracy."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the operational strategies CarMax implemented to address competition from online-only used car retailers and how these strategies align with their broader business goals.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage has several sections, and I remember there's a section titled \"Competition\" which might have the necessary details. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at the \"Competition\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"CarMax unveiled an Omni-channel platform to allow customers to buy a car online, in-store, or any combination of these.\" That seems like a key strategy. Then it mentions specific offerings like home delivery, contactless curbside pickup, etc. These are likely part of their operational strategies to compete with online-only retailers.\n\nAnother part of the passage under \"Competition\" states: \"These offerings directly compete with other home delivery-based options such as Carvana, CarGurus, Vroom, Shift Technologies, and others.\" This shows that CarMax's strategies are aimed at countering these online competitors.\n\nNow, how do these strategies align with broader business goals? The passage mentions CarMax's focus on customer experience, like the 90-day warranty, 10-day money-back guarantee, and thorough vehicle inspections. These are part of their commitment to transparency and customer satisfaction, which are likely core business goals. The Omni-channel platform would enhance customer convenience, supporting their goal of providing a seamless shopping experience. Also, expanding their presence through new stores (as mentioned in the \"Concept\" section) might be part of their growth strategy.\n\nWait, the user specifically asked about strategies to address competition from online-only retailers. The Omni-channel approach and home delivery options are directly responding to that. The broader business goals would include maintaining market leadership, ensuring customer loyalty, and driving sales. The passage also mentions CarMax's recognition as a top employer, which might relate to their overall business goals of maintaining a strong company reputation and employee satisfaction, which in turn supports customer service quality.\n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the correct sentences. The Omni-channel platform is mentioned in [S32], the specific offerings in [S33], and the competition with other companies in [S34]. The broader goals might be inferred from other parts, like the customer guarantees in [S24] and the focus on customer experience. However, the question is about strategies to address competition, so the main citations would be from the Competition section.\n\nI should structure the answer by stating the strategies (Omni-channel platform, home delivery, curbside pickup) and cite [S32][S33][S34]. Then, for alignment with business goals, perhaps mention customer-centric approaches and market leadership, but since the passage doesn't explicitly link these strategies to broader goals beyond competition, I might need to rely on the existing citations. However, the user might expect that the strategies themselves are part of broader goals like customer satisfaction and market expansion. But since the passage doesn't explicitly state that, I should stick to what's written. Maybe the business goals are implied through their focus on customer experience and expanding operations."

        "[S1] CarMax\n\n\n# CarMax\n\n\n\n**CarMax, Inc.** is a used vehicle retailer based in the United States. [S2] It operates two business segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance. [S3] The company began as a side business of Circuit City, opening its first location in September 1993 in Richmond, Virginia. [S4] As of January 2025,\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49 CarMax operates 253 locations. [S5] While CarMax stores focus on marketing used vehicles, the company acquired its first new car franchise with Chrysler Corporation in 1996. [S6] By 1999, it added new vehicle franchises for Mitsubishi Motors, Toyota, and Nissan. [S7] In late 2021, CarMax sold its last new vehicle dealership, located in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to the Rydell Company. [S8] ## About\n\nCarMax's headquarters is located in Richmond, Virginia. [S9] CarMax Auto Finance operates from Kennesaw, Georgia. [S10] There are CarMax retail locations in 41 states as well as customer service call centers (called Customer Experience Centers). [S11] ## Concept\n\nCircuit City executives developed the concept for CarMax under then-CEO Richard L. [S12] Sharp. [S13] It was developed for nearly a year in 1991, using the code name \"Project X\". [S14] It was also known as \"Honest Rick's Used Cars\" to those intimately involved in the skunk works team. [S15] The concept was first proposed by Ronald L. [S16] Moore of Richmond, Virginia, a consultant hired by Circuit City to evaluate possible business opportunities beyond the scope of their consumer electronics locations. [S17] Before the first store was built, DeVito/Verdi was hired as the advertising agency and creative resource. [S18] The company executed the campaign and additional TV advertisements throughout several years in support of the launch and the initial wave of stores. [S19] The business model began with no fees. [S20] However, the model was subsequently abandoned for the current business model after it was determined that customers were not concerned about paying transaction fees to purchase a vehicle. [S21] A typical CarMax store is approximately 59,000 square feet (5,500\u00a0m\u00b2), carries an inventory of 300\u2013400 vehicles, and turns its inventory over eight to ten times a year. [S22] On average, a CarMax location employs 40 sales associates. [S23] Each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 90-day warranty, three days to change the financing for free, and, 10-day money-back guarantee (reduced in 2024 from a 30-day money-back guarantee). [S24] Circuit City issued the first CarMax stock in February 1997, when CarMax had seven locations. [S25] Initially, the stock was a tracking stock still under the umbrella of Circuit City. [S26] CarMax officially split from Circuit City as of October 1, 2002, when it was spun off as a stock dividend for Circuit City shareholders, with shares also issued to those holding CarMax tracking stock. [S27] CarMax sold over 750,000 vehicles to consumers in Fiscal Year 2021 (March 1, 2020\u2013February 28, 2021). [S28] According to the CarMax fiscal year 2018 report released on April 24, 2018, the company opened 15 used car superstores in Fiscal Year 2018, and planned to open 15 additional stores in Fiscal Year 2019. [S29] ## Competition\n\nWhile CarMax is seen as the nation's largest used-car retailer, it has competition. [S30] With a significant shift in customer shopping habits, more online-only companies have worked to capture Carmax's share in the used vehicle market. [S31] CarMax unveiled an Omni-channel platform to allow customers to buy a car online, in-store, or any combination of these. [S32] They have provided opportunities for customers to choose vehicle delivery at their homes, contactless curbside pickup, and more. [S33] These offerings directly compete with other home delivery-based options such as Carvana, CarGurus, Vroom, Shift Technologies, and others. [S34] ## Recognition\n\nCarMax is listed on *Fortune*'s \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" list from 2005 to 2023, placing 75th in 2023.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about CarMax's significant milestones in expanding and diversifying into new vehicle sales and when they exited that segment.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passage and identify the relevant sentences. Let me scan through each section.\n\nStarting with the beginning: CarMax started as a side business of Circuit City in 1993. Then, in 1996, they acquired their first new car franchise with Chrysler. By 1999, they added more franchises for Mitsubishi, Toyota, and Nissan. That's definitely milestones in diversification. Then, in late 2021, they sold their last new vehicle dealership in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to Rydell Company. That's when they exited the segment.\n\nSo the key points are the 1996 Chrysler franchise, 1999 additions, and the 2021 sale. I need to check the sentence numbers. \n\nLooking at the passage: [S5] mentions the first new car franchise with Chrysler in 1996. [S6] says by 1999, they added Mitsubishi, Toyota, Nissan. [S7] states they sold the last dealership in 2021. \n\nSo the answer should list these events with their respective citations. The exit was in 2021, as per [S7]. The expansion milestones are in [S5] and [S6]. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each milestone as a separate statement, citing the correct sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific customer guarantees and service standards that CarMax provides and how they've evolved over time. I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of guarantees or service standards. Let's go through each section. \n\nIn the \"Concept\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"Each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 90-day warranty, three days to change the financing for free, and, 10-day money-back guarantee (reduced in 2024 from a 30-day money-back guarantee).\" That seems to mention specific guarantees. The 90-day warranty, free financing change within three days, and the money-back guarantee. Also, the money-back period was reduced from 30 days to 10 days in 2024. That's an evolution over time.\n\nAre there other parts? Let me check. The \"Competition\" section mentions Omni-channel platform, home delivery, curbside pickup, but those are more about services rather than guarantees. The \"Recognition\" section talks about awards but not specific guarantees. \n\nLooking at other sentences, maybe the business model changes? The passage mentions that the initial business model had no fees but was abandoned because customers weren't concerned about transaction fees. However, that's more about pricing than customer guarantees. \n\nAnother part: \"CarMax unveiled an Omni-channel platform...\" but again, that's a service feature. The 10-day money-back guarantee is explicitly mentioned with the change in 2024. The 90-day warranty and financing change period are other points. \n\nSo the specific guarantees are the 90-day warranty, 3-day financing change, and the 10-day money-back (reduced from 30 days). The evolution is the reduction of the money-back period from 30 to 10 days. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other guarantees mentioned. Let me check again. The passage doesn't mention other guarantees. So the answer should include those three points with the citation from S24. The evolution is noted in the same sentence about the money-back guarantee. \n\nSo the statement would be: CarMax provides a 90-day warranty, a 3-day financing change period, and a 10-day money-back guarantee (reduced from 30 days in 2024). The citation is S24. That's the only relevant sentence. No other sentences mention guarantees or their evolution. So the answer is based on that single sentence."
