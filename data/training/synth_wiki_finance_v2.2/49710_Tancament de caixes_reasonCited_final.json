      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the 'Tancament de caixes' protest extended beyond Barcelona and the immediate governmental responses.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the protest started in Barcelona but then spread to other cities. Specifically, sentence S11 says: \"The protest extended to Sabadell, Matar\u00f3, Manresa and Villafranca del Penedes...\" So that's the extension beyond Barcelona. The immediate governmental response is mentioned in S10: \"The government declared a state of emergency.\" Also, S11 mentions that some business-owners were arrested for not paying taxes. So those are the responses.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The extension is covered in S11, and the governmental responses are S10 and S11. Wait, S10 is the state of emergency, and S11 mentions the arrests. So the answer should have two sentences: one about the extension with citation S11, and another about the government's response with S10 and S11. Let me check again. The user wants the immediate responses. The state of emergency is an immediate response, and the arrests are part of the government's actions. So yes, both S10 and S11 are relevant here.\n\nNow, structuring the answer with the correct citations. Each sentence in the answer should be in <statement> tags with the citations in <cite>. So first statement about the extension, then the government responses. Make sure not to miss any citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the long-term political consequences of the 'Tancament de caixes' for the Spanish government and Catalan nationalism, and how the resignation of key figures reflected the crisis.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage mentions the consequences in a section labeled \"Consequences\". There are three points listed there: the resignation of Barcelona mayor Doctor Robert, the resignations of two Spanish government ministers, and the alienation of the Catalan middle class leading to stronger Catalan nationalism.\n\nThe question has two parts: the long-term consequences and the resignations. The passage directly states that the protest led to the resignation of key figures like the mayor and ministers. The consequences also mention the alienation of the Catalan bourgeoisie, which would contribute to Catalan nationalism. However, the passage doesn't go into long-term effects beyond that. It mentions the strengthening of Catalan nationalism as a result of the alienation. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not adding information not present. The passage doesn't specify further long-term outcomes beyond the immediate effects listed. The resignations are cited in the consequences section, so their citations would be from the relevant sentences. The alienation and strengthening of nationalism are in the same section. \n\nSo, the answer should connect the resignations to the crisis, citing the relevant sentences. The long-term consequences would be the alienation leading to Catalan nationalism, as per the passage. I need to structure the statements with proper citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the appropriate citations from the passage."
