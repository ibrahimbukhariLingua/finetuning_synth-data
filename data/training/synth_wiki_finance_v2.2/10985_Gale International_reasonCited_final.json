      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Gale International\n\n\n# Gale International\n\n\n\n**Gale International** is a privately owned real estate development company based in New York City. [S2] With roots dating back to 1922, the company is active in North America and Asia, specializing in city-scale, commercial, mixed-use, and golf course developments. [S3] ## History\n\nIn 1922 Daniel Gale founded the Daniel Gale Agency, a residential real estate development and brokerage company based in Long Island, New York. [S4] Daniel Gale\u2019s son, Kent Gale, expanded the firm to become one of the largest privately owned real estate brokerages in the U.S., known today as Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. [S5] Kent Gale\u2019s son Stan Gale founded The Gale Company in 1985. [S6] By 1990, the company had amassed a $500 million portfolio of development properties. [S7] Working with partners such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and SL Green, The Gale Company diversified into investment, development, property management, leasing and global facilities management, culminating in a sale to Mack-Cali Realty in 2008 for $545 million. [S8] The transaction was then one of the largest sales of a privately owned company to a public REIT (real estate investment trust). [S9] ## U.S. [S10] Development\n\nNotable U.S. [S11] projects include the relocation of the U.S. [S12] headquarters of Sanofi-Aventis Group to Bridgewater, New Jersey, in a $250 million lease transaction. [S13] One Lincoln Street, a landmark 1.1M SF speculative office tower in Boston\u2019s Financial District, was 100% leased to State Street Financial while under construction and subsequently sold in 2004 for $705 million, which was, at the time, the most valuable commercial real estate transaction in Boston's history. [S14] The Gale Company\u2019s first golf course-centric master planned community was the Ibis Golf and Country Club in West Palm Beach, comprising 2,500 homes and three Nicklaus golf courses, completed in 1996. [S15] One of the company\u2019s noteworthy mixed-use projects is the Green at Florham Park (New Jersey), a 270-acre joint venture with The Rockefeller Group that includes a new headquarters and training facility for the New York Jets professional football team, age-restricted housing, a luxury hotel and an office complex. [S16] Recent projects include the 21W20 residential condominium in New York City\u2019s Flatiron District, and the Campus at Greenhill, a 300,000 SF Class A office complex located on 104 acres, in Wallingford, CT. [S17] In February 2022, Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty celebrated its centennial with a celebration at the UBS Arena in New York. [S18] ## International Development\n\nIn 2004 Stan Gale created Gale International to focus on international development. [S19] The company serves as the principal developer of Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD), a 1500-acre (6 sq km) greenfield city-scale project located on the west coast of South Korea. [S20] In this endeavor, Gale partnered with leading urban development companies, such as Nicklaus Design, Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arup Engineering, Whitman Strategy Group, United Technologies, Cisco Systems, Parsons Brinckerhoff, among others. [S21] In 2009 Gale International served as the master plan developer for the 1,700-acre (7 sq km) Meixi Lake development project, located in Changsha, Hunan Province. [S22] The master plan was then executed by the Changsha Municipal Government and local authorities. [S23] ## Sustainability and Wellness\n\nTo achieve the mandate for Songdo set forth by the South Korean government, which called for a state-of-the-art urban development built to international standards, Gale applied the U.S. [S24] Green Building Council\u2019s LEED certification system to the Songdo IBD project. [S25] Songdo IBD boasts over 20 million sq ft of LEED-certified space, including the nation\u2019s first LEED-certified residential building (Central Park residential), LEED-certified school (Chadwick International), LEED-certified hotel (Sheraton Incheon), and Asia\u2019s first LEED-certified convention center (Convensia).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S26] The company\u2019s 21W 20th St residential project earned the world\u2019s first ever WELL certification under the WELL building standard, a system that measures the residential environment\u2019s impact on residents\u2019 health and wellness.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the 2008 sale of The Gale Company to Mack-Cali Realty and how that relates to the establishment of Gale International in 2004.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passage. \n\nIn the history section, there's a mention that The Gale Company was sold to Mack-Cali Realty in 2008 for $545 million, which was a significant sale as it was one of the largest to a public REIT. That's probably the significance part. Then, Gale International was established in 2004 by Stan Gale. The question is how these two events are related.\n\nLooking at the timeline: The Gale Company was founded in 1985, grew to a $500 million portfolio by 1990, and then in 2008 was sold. Gale International was created in 2004. The passage mentions that Gale International was created to focus on international development, with Songdo IBD starting around that time. \n\nSo the connection might be that after the 2008 sale, the company shifted focus, but wait, Gale International was established before the sale. The sale happened in 2008, and Gale International was established in 2004. So maybe the sale was part of the company's evolution, and establishing Gale International was a separate move towards international projects. But how are they related?\n\nThe user might be thinking that the sale in 2008 led to the creation of Gale International, but according to the text, Gale International was created in 2004, which is before the sale. So perhaps the sale was a separate event, but both are part of the company's expansion. The significance of the sale is that it was a major transaction, and Gale International's establishment was about international development. The relation could be that the sale allowed the company to refocus or fund international projects, but the text doesn't explicitly state that. The passage says that Gale International was created in 2004, and the sale happened later. So the answer should note that the sale was a major event, and Gale International was established earlier for international development, but the connection isn't directly stated. However, maybe the sale was part of the company's strategy that enabled further expansion, but I need to stick to the given text.\n\nSo the answer should mention the 2008 sale's significance as a major transaction and note that Gale International was established in 2004, but the text doesn't explicitly link them. However, since the question asks how they relate, perhaps the answer is that the sale was part of the company's growth, and Gale International was a separate initiative, but the text doesn't specify a direct relationship. Wait, the passage says that in 2004, Stan Gale created Gale International, and the sale happened in 2008. So the relation might be that the establishment of Gale International in 2004 was part of the company's strategy, and the 2008 sale was a significant event in its history, but they are separate events. However, the user might think there's a connection, but based on the text, there's no direct mention. So the answer should state the significance of the sale and note that Gale International was established in 2004, but the text doesn't explicitly connect them. However, maybe the sale was part of the company's evolution leading to international focus, but that's an assumption. The answer should stick strictly to the given text."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Gale International incorporated sustainability standards into its international projects and what specific certifications they achieved.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the sections about sustainability and certifications. \n\nIn Passage 1, under the \"Sustainability and Wellness\" section, there's a mention of Gale applying the U.S. Green Building Council\u2019s LEED certification system to the Songdo IBD project. That's a key point. It also lists several LEED-certified buildings in Songdo, like the Central Park residential, Chadwick International school, Sheraton Incheon hotel, and Convensia convention center. So LEED certifications are definitely part of the answer.\n\nThen, looking at Passage 2, there's a sentence about the 21W20 project earning the world's first WELL certification. WELL is another certification related to health and wellness, so that's another specific certification they achieved.\n\nNow, the question is about international projects. Songdo IBD is in South Korea, Meixi Lake in China, and other projects like the Jack Nicklaus Golf Course in Korea. The LEED certifications mentioned are for Songdo projects, which are international. The WELL certification for 21W20 is in New York, which is a U.S. project, but the question is about international efforts. Wait, the user might be focusing on international projects, so maybe the 21W20 is in the U.S., but the question says \"international projects,\" so perhaps the answer should focus on the LEED certifications in Songdo and Meixi Lake. However, the user might consider any project outside the U.S. as international. But the 21W20 is in NYC, so maybe that's a U.S. project. However, the question is about how they incorporated sustainability standards into international projects, so the main examples would be Songdo and Meixi Lake.\n\nBut the passage also mentions that in the Songdo IBD project, they used LEED, and the specific certifications are listed. The Meixi Lake project is mentioned in S21 and S22, but there's no mention of certifications there. So the certifications are specifically tied to Songdo. \n\nSo the answer would be that Gale International incorporated sustainability by using LEED certification for Songdo IBD, achieving multiple LEED certifications for various buildings there. Additionally, the 21W20 project got WELL certification, but that's in the U.S. However, the question is about international projects, so maybe the WELL certification is not relevant here. Wait, the user didn't specify that the projects have to be outside the U.S., just that the company's international projects. But the 21W20 is in New York, which is U.S., so maybe that's not part of the international projects. So the main certifications would be the LEED ones in Songdo.\n\nSo the answer would state that Gale International incorporated sustainability standards by applying the LEED certification system to the Songdo IBD project, resulting in multiple LEED certifications for buildings like Central Park residential, Chadwick International, Sheraton Incheon, and Convensia. The specific certifications achieved are LEED certifications for those structures. \n\nI need to check the citations. The LEED part is in S24 and S25. The specific buildings are mentioned in S25. The WELL certification is in S26, but that's for a U.S. project. Since the question is about international projects, maybe the WELL isn't included. But the user's question is about \"international projects,\" so if the 21W20 is considered an international project, but it's in NYC, which is US. So probably only the LEED certifications are relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should mention the use of LEED standards in Songdo IBD and the specific certifications achieved there, citing S24 and S25. The other certifications might be for different projects, but the user is asking about international projects, so focusing on Songdo and Meixi Lake. However, Meixi Lake doesn't mention certifications. So the main points are LEED in Songdo."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Gale International\n\n\n# Gale International\n\n\n\n**Gale International** is a privately owned real estate development company based in New York City. [S2] With roots dating back to 1922, the company is active in North America and Asia, specializing in city-scale, commercial, mixed-use, and golf course developments. [S3] ## History\n\nIn 1922 Daniel Gale founded the Daniel Gale Agency, a residential real estate development and brokerage company based in Long Island, New York. [S4] Daniel Gale\u2019s son, Kent Gale, expanded the firm to become one of the largest privately owned real estate brokerages in the U.S., known today as Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. [S5] Kent Gale\u2019s son Stan Gale founded The Gale Company in 1985. [S6] By 1990, the company had amassed a $500 million portfolio of development properties. [S7] Working with partners such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and SL Green, The Gale Company diversified into investment, development, property management, leasing and global facilities management, culminating in a sale to Mack-Cali Realty in 2008 for $545 million. [S8] The transaction was then one of the largest sales of a privately owned company to a public REIT (real estate investment trust). [S9] ## U.S. [S10] Development\n\nNotable U.S. [S11] projects include the relocation of the U.S. [S12] headquarters of Sanofi-Aventis Group to Bridgewater, New Jersey, in a $250 million lease transaction. [S13] One Lincoln Street, a landmark 1.1M SF speculative office tower in Boston\u2019s Financial District, was 100% leased to State Street Financial while under construction and subsequently sold in 2004 for $705 million, which was, at the time, the most valuable commercial real estate transaction in Boston's history. [S14] The Gale Company\u2019s first golf course-centric master planned community was the Ibis Golf and Country Club in West Palm Beach, comprising 2,500 homes and three Nicklaus golf courses, completed in 1996. [S15] One of the company\u2019s noteworthy mixed-use projects is the Green at Florham Park (New Jersey), a 270-acre joint venture with The Rockefeller Group that includes a new headquarters and training facility for the New York Jets professional football team, age-restricted housing, a luxury hotel and an office complex. [S16] Recent projects include the 21W20 residential condominium in New York City\u2019s Flatiron District, and the Campus at Greenhill, a 300,000 SF Class A office complex located on 104 acres, in Wallingford, CT. [S17] In February 2022, Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty celebrated its centennial with a celebration at the UBS Arena in New York. [S18] ## International Development\n\nIn 2004 Stan Gale created Gale International to focus on international development. [S19] The company serves as the principal developer of Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD), a 1500-acre (6 sq km) greenfield city-scale project located on the west coast of South Korea. [S20] In this endeavor, Gale partnered with leading urban development companies, such as Nicklaus Design, Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arup Engineering, Whitman Strategy Group, United Technologies, Cisco Systems, Parsons Brinckerhoff, among others. [S21] In 2009 Gale International served as the master plan developer for the 1,700-acre (7 sq km) Meixi Lake development project, located in Changsha, Hunan Province. [S22] The master plan was then executed by the Changsha Municipal Government and local authorities. [S23] ## Sustainability and Wellness\n\nTo achieve the mandate for Songdo set forth by the South Korean government, which called for a state-of-the-art urban development built to international standards, Gale applied the U.S. [S24] Green Building Council\u2019s LEED certification system to the Songdo IBD project. [S25] Songdo IBD boasts over 20 million sq ft of LEED-certified space, including the nation\u2019s first LEED-certified residential building (Central Park residential), LEED-certified school (Chadwick International), LEED-certified hotel (Sheraton Incheon), and Asia\u2019s first LEED-certified convention center (Convensia).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S26] The company\u2019s 21W 20th St residential project earned the world\u2019s first ever WELL certification under the WELL building standard, a system that measures the residential environment\u2019s impact on residents\u2019 health and wellness.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key international real estate projects developed by Gale International and the partners involved. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Gale International in several sections. Let me start by identifying the sections that talk about their international projects.\n\nLooking at the \"International Development\" section, there's a mention of Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD) in South Korea. It says Gale International is the principal developer here. Then, in the same section, there's a list of partners like Nicklaus Design, Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arup Engineering, etc. That's one project with multiple partners.\n\nAnother project mentioned is the Meixi Lake development in Changsha, China. The master plan was executed by the Changsha Municipal Government and local authorities. So the partners here would be the local authorities, but the text doesn't specify other companies here. \n\nThen, in Passage 2, there's a list of projects. Under international projects, Songdo IBD and Meixi Lake are listed. Also, there's Canal Walk, The # First World, Central Park, etc., but those might be part of Songdo IBD. The Jack Nicklaus Golf Course in Korea and Ibis Golf and Country Club in Florida are mentioned, but the latter is in the U.S., so maybe not international. \n\nWait, the question is about international projects. So Ibis Golf is in Florida, which is the U.S., so maybe not. But the Jack Nicklaus Golf Course in Korea is part of Songdo IBD. \n\nThe partners for Songdo IBD are listed in S20 and S21. The partners include Nicklaus Design, Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arup Engineering, Whitman Strategy Group, United Technologies, Cisco Systems, Parsons Brinckerhoff. \n\nFor Meixi Lake, the partners are the Changsha Municipal Government and local authorities, as per S22 and S23. \n\nAre there any other international projects? The passage also mentions the Campus at Greenhill in Connecticut, but that's in the U.S. The Green at Florham Park is in New Jersey. So those are domestic. \n\nSo the key international projects are Songdo IBD and Meixi Lake. The partners for Songdo are the ones listed, and for Meixi Lake, the local government. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other projects. The list in Passage 2 includes Canal Walk, The # First World, etc., but those are probably parts of Songdo IBD. The user might want the main projects. \n\nSo the answer should list Songdo IBD and Meixi Lake as the key international projects, with their respective partners. The citations would be S19, S20, S21 for Songdo, and S21, S22, S23 for Meixi Lake. Wait, S21 mentions the partners for Songdo, and S22 and S23 mention Meixi Lake's execution by local authorities. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each project and the partners, citing the correct sentences. Also, check if there are other projects. The passage also mentions the 21W20 project, but that's in New York, so domestic. \n\nSo the final answer should have two key projects: Songdo IBD and Meixi Lake, with their partners as per the context."

Let me start by scanning the sections about the history and international development. \n\nIn the \"History\" section, it mentions that Stan Gale founded The Gale Company in 1985, and by 1990 they had a $500 million portfolio. They diversified into various areas like investment, development, property management, etc., and sold to Mack-Cali in 2008. Then, in 2004, Stan Gale created Gale International to focus on international development. That seems like a key point. The transition from The Gale Company to Gale International is marked by the shift to international projects.\n\nLooking at the \"International Development\" section, Gale International is involved in projects like Songdo IBD in South Korea and Meixi Lake in China. The passage also mentions partnerships with international firms and the use of LEED certification, which ties into sustainability. This suggests a strategic focus on global markets and sustainable development.\n\nThe evidence supporting this shift would be the creation of Gale International in 2004 specifically for international development, the projects in South Korea and China, and the emphasis on sustainability through LEED. Also, the mention of working with international partners like Nicklaus Design and others indicates a broader strategic move beyond the U.S.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The transition is mentioned in S18 (creation of Gale International in 2004) and S19. The international projects are in S19, S20, S21, S22, S23. The sustainability aspect is in S24 and S25. \n\nWait, the question also asks about the strategic focus changes. The original Gale Company was focused on U.S. projects, as seen in their U.S. developments like the Sanofi-Aventis relocation, One Lincoln Street, and others. The shift to Gale International involved expanding to international markets, which is a change in strategic focus. The evidence includes the establishment of Gale International, the specific international projects, and the emphasis on sustainability and global partnerships.\n\nI should structure the answer by first stating the transition and then the evidence.
