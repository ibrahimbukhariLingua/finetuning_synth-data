      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S38] **Simon de Wit** was a large family-owned chain of supermarkets in the Netherlands. [S39] The company was founded by Simon de Wit (1852\u20131934), who after his father's death in 1867 started a grocery store from his parental house in Wormerveer. [S40] In 1888 he opened the first branch in Amsterdam and by 1900 he ran stores at 30 different locations and owned a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S41] In 1954 the opening of the 150th store was celebrated. [S42] In 1970, when Simon de Wit's grandson Simon was in charge, a fire destroyed the central warehouse in Zaandam. [S43] Soon after, Albert Heijn, which also originated in the Zaanstreek, showed interest in a takeover and in 1973 Simon de Wit merged with Albert Heijn, with all employees retaining their jobs. [S44] All remaining shops took on the name of the latter. [S45] ## Format\n\n\n### Albert Heijn\n\nThis format is most used throughout the Netherlands and Belgium and is their regular store format. [S46] Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept *Echt Vers (Really Fresh)* in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10\u201315% more fresh produce. [S47] Albert Heijn also distinguishes itself by the steadily growing range of organic and ecological products, reducing the use of plastics and investing in sustainable construction and transport. [S48] The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand \"Puur & Eerlijk\" in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging. [S49] The retail chain is also committed to reducing food waste. [S50] ### AH To Go\n\nIn 1999, the chain developed a new format for a convenience store on request of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the railway company would become a franchisee and opened the first store on Station Den Bosch. [S51] The format got its current name in 2001, and specialises in products that customers need on their commute. [S52] Since 2019, the company is testing a new version of the format without staff and cash registers. [S53] The customer scans their debit card and cameras register the customer and the items that are picked, after the customer leaves the right amount is deducted from their account. [S54] The new concept and technology was tested in a mobile unit that has been placed at the headquarters of Ahold Delhaize and Schiphol. [S55] ### AH XL\n\nSince 2002, the company operates several hypermarkets with a larger variety of products in both food and non-food. [S56] Within the store there are also several chefs preparing take-away. [S57] This kind of store usually occupies the whole floor. [S58] ### Albert Heijn Online\n\nThe company started testing delivery in 1999, with the Albert Heijn Thuisservice, which was renamed Albert.nl in 2001. [S59] Via this channel customers could purchase their groceries, but also products from sister-companies Etos and Gall & Gall. [S60] The Albert brand was discontinued in 2014, and the delivery service was integrated in the Albert Heijn brand. [S61] ## Organisation and brand value\n\nSince 1899, the chain is headquartered in Zaandam, their parent company is also located here. [S62] The chain operates six distribution centres in Nieuwegein, Geldermalsen, Zaandam, Tilburg, Pijnacker and Zwolle. [S63] In addition to an ever-growing impressive number of stores - both franchise and in-house - the chain also operates seven \"Home Shop Centers\" in Almere, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, De Meern, Amsterdam, Oosterhout and Bleiswijk. [S64] The brand value of Albert Heijn was 866 million dollars in 2014, according to Trademark Office Interbrand. [S65] This put Albert Heijn in 26th place in the European brand values top 50.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Albert Heijn\n\n\n# Albert Heijn\n\n\n\n**Albert Heijn** (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0251lb\u0259rt \u02c8\u0266\u025bin]), often abbreviated to **AH** (pronounced [a\u02d0\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0]) and informally to **Appie** (pronounced [\u02c8\u0251pi]), is the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands with a market share of 34.8% in 2020. [S2] It was founded in 1887, and has been part of Ahold Delhaize since 2016. [S3] ## History\n\nThe chain was founded on 27 May 1887, when Albert Heijn bought a grocery store from his father Jan Heijn in Oostzaan. [S4] In the following years, Heijn opened other locations in several cities and in 1899, he opened a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S5] From 1895, Heijn started roasting his own brand of coffee in a laundry room in his Oostzaan location and in 1910, several other self-produced items were added, including confectionery, cakes and pastry. [S6] Until 1913, these products were produced in an old town house in Zaandam, but the company built a professional factory on this spot in 1913. [S7] In 1920, all enterprises were combined in the *Maatschappij tot Exploitatie der Fabrieken en Handelszaken* (Lit. [S8] \"Society for the Exploitation of Factories and Businesses\"). [S9] Anton Jurgens, one of the founders of Unilever, took a 50% share in the new company. [S10] These shares were bought back by the Heijn family in 1927. [S11] On 29 April 1920, Albert Heijn transferred control of the company to his sons Gerrit Heijn and Jan Heijn, and his son-in-law Johan Hille. [S12] Albert Heijn stayed on as president of the board. [S13] Albert Heijn Sr. [S14] benefited from the industrialization that brought prosperity through fixed wages for factory workers and a new group of rich people. [S15] Eating habits changed: less in quantity but more and other types of items. [S16] Due to the rise of manufacturers and prepackaged items, indigenous and exclusive products came within reach. [S17] The chain went public in 1948, and underwent two major changes in the 1950s. [S18] The first change was in 1952, with the introduction of their first self-service store and the second change was in 1955, with the opening of their first supermarket. [S19] The chain could become the largest within the Netherlands via several acquisitions. [S20] Notable (partial) acquisitions were Van Amerongen (1950), Simon de Wit (1972) and C1000 (2008 and parts in 2012). [S21] Ahold NV was founded on August 27, 1973 and Albert Heijn became part of it. [S22] The new construction made it easier for Albert Heijn's new parent company to enter the foreign market. [S23] In October of the same year, Etos was acquired, a number of stores were converted into Albert Heijn and the rest continued as a drugstore within Ahold. [S24] At the beginning of 2003, Albert Heijn saw its market share fall sharply: 22.8 percent against 24.7 percent a year earlier. [S25] In order to win back customers and leave the expensive image behind, Albert Heijn decided to start a large-scale price reduction in the same year. [S26] The chain permanently reduced the price of thousands of items every so often. [S27] At the end of 2006, managing director Dick Boer announced that Albert Heijn would stop lowering prices. [S28] The price difference with the competitors was successfully reduced by many percent. [S29] The market share was almost 30 percent at the end of 2006. [S30] In 2007, the company crossed the ocean with the opening of a franchise store in Cura\u00e7ao. [S31] This shop remained open until 2016, when it was changed to a different brand. [S32] The company entered the Belgian market in 2011, with the opening of a store in Brasschaat. [S33] Despite the merger of Ahold and Delhaize, Albert Heijn and Delhaize both remained active in Belgium. [S34] Currently Albert Heijn has 60 stores. [S35] After Cura\u00e7ao and Belgium the company entered the German market with their AH To Go formula. [S36] This venture ended in 2018. [S37] ### Simon de Wit",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of the merger between Albert Heijn and Simon de Wit in 1972 on the latter's operations and the role the 1970 fire at Simon de Wit's central warehouse played in this merger.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that in 1970, there was a fire that destroyed Simon de Wit's central warehouse in Zaandam. Then, shortly after, Albert Heijn showed interest in a takeover, leading to the merger in 1973. The merger allowed Simon de Wit to merge with Albert Heijn, with employees retaining their jobs, and all remaining shops adopting the latter's name.\n\nSo, the fire likely weakened Simon de Wit's operations, making them more vulnerable to a takeover. The merger would have allowed Albert Heijn to expand, possibly by acquiring Simon de Wit's stores and infrastructure. The fire might have been a catalyst for the merger as it damaged their central warehouse, which is a critical part of their operations. However, the exact details on how the merger impacted Simon de Wit's operations beyond the name change and employee retention aren't specified. The context doesn't mention specific operational changes post-merger, just that they merged and took on Albert Heijn's name.\n\nI need to check the citations. The fire is mentioned in [S42], and the merger in [S43]. The merger details are in [S43] and [S44]. The question also asks about the role of the fire in the merger. The context states that after the fire, Albert Heijn showed interest, leading to the merger. So the fire probably made Simon de Wit's situation precarious, prompting the merger. But the exact impact on operations isn't detailed beyond the name change and retention of employees. The answer should reflect that the fire likely disrupted operations, leading to the merger, but the specific operational impacts aren't detailed in the context beyond the merger terms."

[S41] In 1954 the opening of the 150th store was celebrated. [S42] In 1970, when Simon de Wit's grandson Simon was in charge, a fire destroyed the central warehouse in Zaandam. [S43] Soon after, Albert Heijn, which also originated in the Zaanstreek, showed interest in a takeover and in 1973 Simon de Wit merged with Albert Heijn, with all employees retaining their jobs. [S44] All remaining shops took on the name of the latter. [S45] ## Format\n\n\n### Albert Heijn\n\nThis format is most used throughout the Netherlands and Belgium and is their regular store format. [S46] Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept *Echt Vers (Really Fresh)* in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10\u201315% more fresh produce. [S47] Albert Heijn also distinguishes itself by the steadily growing range of organic and ecological products, reducing the use of plastics and investing in sustainable construction and transport. [S48] The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand \"Puur & Eerlijk\" in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging. [S49] The retail chain is also committed to reducing food waste. [S50] ### AH To Go\n\nIn 1999, the chain developed a new format for a convenience store on request of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the railway company would become a franchisee and opened the first store on Station Den Bosch. [S51] The format got its current name in 2001, and specialises in products that customers need on their commute. [S52] Since 2019, the company is testing a new version of the format without staff and cash registers. [S53] The customer scans their debit card and cameras register the customer and the items that are picked, after the customer leaves the right amount is deducted from their account. [S54] The new concept and technology was tested in a mobile unit that has been placed at the headquarters of Ahold Delhaize and Schiphol. [S55] ### AH XL\n\nSince 2002, the company operates several hypermarkets with a larger variety of products in both food and non-food. [S56] Within the store there are also several chefs preparing take-away. [S57] This kind of store usually occupies the whole floor. [S58] ### Albert Heijn Online\n\nThe company started testing delivery in 1999, with the Albert Heijn Thuisservice, which was renamed Albert.nl in 2001. [S59] Via this channel customers could purchase their groceries, but also products from sister-companies Etos and Gall & Gall. [S60] The Albert brand was discontinued in 2014, and the delivery service was integrated in the Albert Heijn brand. [S61] ## Organisation and brand value\n\nSince 1899, the chain is headquartered in Zaandam, their parent company is also located here. [S62] The chain operates six distribution centres in Nieuwegein, Geldermalsen, Zaandam, Tilburg, Pijnacker and Zwolle. [S63] In addition to an ever-growing impressive number of stores - both franchise and in-house - the chain also operates seven \"Home Shop Centers\" in Almere, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, De Meern, Amsterdam, Oosterhout and Bleiswijk. [S64] The brand value of Albert Heijn was 866 million dollars in 2014, according to Trademark Office Interbrand. [S65] This put Albert Heijn in 26th place in the European brand values top 50.",
        "[S1] Albert Heijn\n\n\n# Albert Heijn\n\n\n\n**Albert Heijn** (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0251lb\u0259rt \u02c8\u0266\u025bin]), often abbreviated to **AH** (pronounced [a\u02d0\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0]) and informally to **Appie** (pronounced [\u02c8\u0251pi]), is the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands with a market share of 34.8% in 2020. [S2] It was founded in 1887, and has been part of Ahold Delhaize since 2016. [S3] ## History\n\nThe chain was founded on 27 May 1887, when Albert Heijn bought a grocery store from his father Jan Heijn in Oostzaan. [S4] In the following years, Heijn opened other locations in several cities and in 1899, he opened a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S5] From 1895, Heijn started roasting his own brand of coffee in a laundry room in his Oostzaan location and in 1910, several other self-produced items were added, including confectionery, cakes and pastry. [S6] Until 1913, these products were produced in an old town house in Zaandam, but the company built a professional factory on this spot in 1913. [S7] In 1920, all enterprises were combined in the *Maatschappij tot Exploitatie der Fabrieken en Handelszaken* (Lit. [S8] \"Society for the Exploitation of Factories and Businesses\"). [S9] Anton Jurgens, one of the founders of Unilever, took a 50% share in the new company. [S10] These shares were bought back by the Heijn family in 1927. [S11] On 29 April 1920, Albert Heijn transferred control of the company to his sons Gerrit Heijn and Jan Heijn, and his son-in-law Johan Hille. [S12] Albert Heijn stayed on as president of the board. [S13] Albert Heijn Sr. [S14] benefited from the industrialization that brought prosperity through fixed wages for factory workers and a new group of rich people. [S15] Eating habits changed: less in quantity but more and other types of items. [S16] Due to the rise of manufacturers and prepackaged items, indigenous and exclusive products came within reach. [S17] The chain went public in 1948, and underwent two major changes in the 1950s. [S18] The first change was in 1952, with the introduction of their first self-service store and the second change was in 1955, with the opening of their first supermarket. [S19] The chain could become the largest within the Netherlands via several acquisitions. [S20] Notable (partial) acquisitions were Van Amerongen (1950), Simon de Wit (1972) and C1000 (2008 and parts in 2012). [S21] Ahold NV was founded on August 27, 1973 and Albert Heijn became part of it. [S22] The new construction made it easier for Albert Heijn's new parent company to enter the foreign market. [S23] In October of the same year, Etos was acquired, a number of stores were converted into Albert Heijn and the rest continued as a drugstore within Ahold. [S24] At the beginning of 2003, Albert Heijn saw its market share fall sharply: 22.8 percent against 24.7 percent a year earlier. [S25] In order to win back customers and leave the expensive image behind, Albert Heijn decided to start a large-scale price reduction in the same year. [S26] The chain permanently reduced the price of thousands of items every so often. [S27] At the end of 2006, managing director Dick Boer announced that Albert Heijn would stop lowering prices. [S28] The price difference with the competitors was successfully reduced by many percent. [S29] The market share was almost 30 percent at the end of 2006. [S30] In 2007, the company crossed the ocean with the opening of a franchise store in Cura\u00e7ao. [S31] This shop remained open until 2016, when it was changed to a different brand. [S32] The company entered the Belgian market in 2011, with the opening of a store in Brasschaat. [S33] Despite the merger of Ahold and Delhaize, Albert Heijn and Delhaize both remained active in Belgium. [S34] Currently Albert Heijn has 60 stores. [S35] After Cura\u00e7ao and Belgium the company entered the German market with their AH To Go formula. [S36] This venture ended in 2018. [S37] ### Simon de Wit"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key developments in Albert Heijn's store formats from the late 20th to early 21st century and how these reflected shifts in consumer behavior or technological advancements.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts, but the main information about store formats is in Passage 1. Let me scan through that.\n\nIn Passage 1, there are sections about different formats: Albert Heijn (the regular format), AH To Go, AH XL, and Albert Heijn Online. Each of these sections has citations. \n\nStarting with the regular Albert Heijn format. The passage mentions that since 2018, they rolled out the Echt Vers concept with more fresh produce. Also, they've been focusing on organic products, reducing plastics, and sustainable practices. The Puru & Eerlijk brand was introduced in 2009 under Dick Boer. These developments likely reflect consumer shifts towards sustainability and health-conscious choices.\n\nThen there's AH To Go, which started in 1999 as a convenience store for commuters. The 2019 test of a staffless store with scanning technology shows a tech advancement, possibly responding to trends in automation and convenience. The use of cameras and card scanning is a tech-driven approach, maybe to cater to busy customers or reduce costs.\n\nAH XL is the hypermarket format since 2002, offering more products and take-away meals. This could indicate a shift towards one-stop shopping and convenience, maybe catering to families or those needing more variety.\n\nAlbert Heijn Online started testing delivery in 1999, renamed in 2001, and integrated into the main brand by 2014. This reflects the rise of e-commerce and online shopping trends, which became more prevalent in the early 21st century.\n\nLooking at the citations, each of these points has references. For example, Echt Vers is [S46]-[S48], Puru & Eerlijk is [S49], AH To Go's tech is [S51]-[S55], AH XL is [S56]-[S58], and online is [S59]-[S61].\n\nI need to make sure these developments are from the late 20th to early 21st century. The late 20th century would be up to 2000, so some of these might be early 21st. For example, AH To Go started in 1999, which is late 20th, and the staffless store in 2019 is early 21st. The online delivery started in 1999 as well. The Echt Vers from 2018 is early 21st. The AH XL since 2002 fits.\n\nAlso, the merger with Simon de Wit in 1973 is mentioned in Passage 1, but that's mid-20th century, so maybe not relevant here. The question is about late 20th to early 21st, so focusing on the formats mentioned.\n\nI should structure the answer by each format, mention the development, and link to the citations. Also, connect each development to consumer behavior or tech advancements. For example, the staffless store relates to tech advancements and convenience, online delivery to e-commerce growth, sustainability efforts to consumer preferences, etc.\n\nCheck if there are other points. The passage also mentions the expansion into Belgium and Germany, but that's more about market expansion than store formats. The question is specifically about store formats, so maybe not relevant here.\n\nSo, compiling the answer with each key development, citations, and the reasoning for how they reflect shifts."

Let me scan through the text.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a section under \"Albert Heijn\" that mentions: \"The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand 'Puur & Eerlijk' in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging.\" That's a key point. So in 2009, they launched 'Puur & Eerlijk' with stricter certifications and packaging changes. Also, the passage says Albert Heijn has been reducing plastic use, investing in sustainable construction and transport, and focusing on organic products. But when exactly did these measures start? The passage mentions \"steadily growing range of organic and ecological products\" but doesn't specify the start date. However, the 'Puur & Eerlijk' initiative is specifically noted in 2009.\n\nAnother part of Passage 1 says: \"Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept *Echt Vers (Really Fresh)* in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10\u201315% more fresh produce.\" But that's about fresh produce, not directly sustainability. However, the 'Puur & Eerlijk' is under the 2009 mention. Also, the passage mentions reducing food waste as part of their commitment. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a mention of Dick Boer in 2009 leading the 'Puur & Eerlijk' initiative. The passage also talks about the company's history, but not much about specific sustainability measures after 2009. However, the 'Puur & Eerlijk' is linked to 2009. The user is asking about evolution between 2009 and 2018. The context might not have details on every year, but the key points are the 2009 initiative and the ongoing efforts like organic products, reducing plastics, sustainable transport, and construction. \n\nSo, the answer should state that in 2009, 'Puur & Eerlijk' was launched under Dick Boer, focusing on stricter certifications and packaging. The sustainability measures included organic products, less plastic, sustainable construction, and transport. The evolution would be the expansion under 'Puur & Eerlijk' and continued efforts until 2018. The citations would be [S48] and [S49] for the 'Puur & Eerlijk' details. Also, [S47] mentions the Echt Vers concept starting in 2018, but that's more about fresh produce. The other sustainability points are in [S48]. \n\nWait, the user asked for specific measures under 'Puur & Eerlijk'. The passage says that the expansion of the sustainable range was under 'Puur & Eerlijk' in 2009, with adjustments to stricter certification and packaging. So the specific measures under that umbrella are the stricter certification and packaging changes. The other sustainability efforts (organic products, plastics, construction, transport) are part of their overall initiatives, not necessarily under 'Puur & Eerlijk'. But the passage says \"the expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand 'Puur & Eerlijk' in 2009\", which implies that the measures under 'Puur & Eerlijk' include those aspects. So maybe the answer should include those as part of the measures under 'Puur & Eerlijk'.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly assigned. The sentence about 'Puur & Eerlijk' in 2009 is [S49], and the sentence about sustainable range, reducing plastics, etc., is [S48]. So the answer would cite both [S48] and [S49] for the measures under 'Puur & Eerlijk'. Also, the evolution from 2009 to 2018 would include the ongoing efforts mentioned in [S48] and the 2018 Echt Vers concept, but that's not directly under 'Puur & Eerlijk'. The user might be looking for the specific measures under the umbrella, so focusing on [S49] and [S48]."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S38] **Simon de Wit** was a large family-owned chain of supermarkets in the Netherlands. [S39] The company was founded by Simon de Wit (1852\u20131934), who after his father's death in 1867 started a grocery store from his parental house in Wormerveer. [S40] In 1888 he opened the first branch in Amsterdam and by 1900 he ran stores at 30 different locations and owned a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S41] In 1954 the opening of the 150th store was celebrated. [S42] In 1970, when Simon de Wit's grandson Simon was in charge, a fire destroyed the central warehouse in Zaandam. [S43] Soon after, Albert Heijn, which also originated in the Zaanstreek, showed interest in a takeover and in 1973 Simon de Wit merged with Albert Heijn, with all employees retaining their jobs. [S44] All remaining shops took on the name of the latter. [S45] ## Format\n\n\n### Albert Heijn\n\nThis format is most used throughout the Netherlands and Belgium and is their regular store format. [S46] Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept *Echt Vers (Really Fresh)* in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10\u201315% more fresh produce. [S47] Albert Heijn also distinguishes itself by the steadily growing range of organic and ecological products, reducing the use of plastics and investing in sustainable construction and transport. [S48] The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand \"Puur & Eerlijk\" in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging. [S49] The retail chain is also committed to reducing food waste. [S50] ### AH To Go\n\nIn 1999, the chain developed a new format for a convenience store on request of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the railway company would become a franchisee and opened the first store on Station Den Bosch. [S51] The format got its current name in 2001, and specialises in products that customers need on their commute. [S52] Since 2019, the company is testing a new version of the format without staff and cash registers. [S53] The customer scans their debit card and cameras register the customer and the items that are picked, after the customer leaves the right amount is deducted from their account. [S54] The new concept and technology was tested in a mobile unit that has been placed at the headquarters of Ahold Delhaize and Schiphol. [S55] ### AH XL\n\nSince 2002, the company operates several hypermarkets with a larger variety of products in both food and non-food. [S56] Within the store there are also several chefs preparing take-away. [S57] This kind of store usually occupies the whole floor. [S58] ### Albert Heijn Online\n\nThe company started testing delivery in 1999, with the Albert Heijn Thuisservice, which was renamed Albert.nl in 2001. [S59] Via this channel customers could purchase their groceries, but also products from sister-companies Etos and Gall & Gall. [S60] The Albert brand was discontinued in 2014, and the delivery service was integrated in the Albert Heijn brand. [S61] ## Organisation and brand value\n\nSince 1899, the chain is headquartered in Zaandam, their parent company is also located here. [S62] The chain operates six distribution centres in Nieuwegein, Geldermalsen, Zaandam, Tilburg, Pijnacker and Zwolle. [S63] In addition to an ever-growing impressive number of stores - both franchise and in-house - the chain also operates seven \"Home Shop Centers\" in Almere, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, De Meern, Amsterdam, Oosterhout and Bleiswijk. [S64] The brand value of Albert Heijn was 866 million dollars in 2014, according to Trademark Office Interbrand. [S65] This put Albert Heijn in 26th place in the European brand values top 50.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Albert Heijn\n\n\n# Albert Heijn\n\n\n\n**Albert Heijn** (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0251lb\u0259rt \u02c8\u0266\u025bin]), often abbreviated to **AH** (pronounced [a\u02d0\u02c8\u0266a\u02d0]) and informally to **Appie** (pronounced [\u02c8\u0251pi]), is the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands with a market share of 34.8% in 2020. [S2] It was founded in 1887, and has been part of Ahold Delhaize since 2016. [S3] ## History\n\nThe chain was founded on 27 May 1887, when Albert Heijn bought a grocery store from his father Jan Heijn in Oostzaan. [S4] In the following years, Heijn opened other locations in several cities and in 1899, he opened a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S5] From 1895, Heijn started roasting his own brand of coffee in a laundry room in his Oostzaan location and in 1910, several other self-produced items were added, including confectionery, cakes and pastry. [S6] Until 1913, these products were produced in an old town house in Zaandam, but the company built a professional factory on this spot in 1913. [S7] In 1920, all enterprises were combined in the *Maatschappij tot Exploitatie der Fabrieken en Handelszaken* (Lit. [S8] \"Society for the Exploitation of Factories and Businesses\"). [S9] Anton Jurgens, one of the founders of Unilever, took a 50% share in the new company. [S10] These shares were bought back by the Heijn family in 1927. [S11] On 29 April 1920, Albert Heijn transferred control of the company to his sons Gerrit Heijn and Jan Heijn, and his son-in-law Johan Hille. [S12] Albert Heijn stayed on as president of the board. [S13] Albert Heijn Sr. [S14] benefited from the industrialization that brought prosperity through fixed wages for factory workers and a new group of rich people. [S15] Eating habits changed: less in quantity but more and other types of items. [S16] Due to the rise of manufacturers and prepackaged items, indigenous and exclusive products came within reach. [S17] The chain went public in 1948, and underwent two major changes in the 1950s. [S18] The first change was in 1952, with the introduction of their first self-service store and the second change was in 1955, with the opening of their first supermarket. [S19] The chain could become the largest within the Netherlands via several acquisitions. [S20] Notable (partial) acquisitions were Van Amerongen (1950), Simon de Wit (1972) and C1000 (2008 and parts in 2012). [S21] Ahold NV was founded on August 27, 1973 and Albert Heijn became part of it. [S22] The new construction made it easier for Albert Heijn's new parent company to enter the foreign market. [S23] In October of the same year, Etos was acquired, a number of stores were converted into Albert Heijn and the rest continued as a drugstore within Ahold. [S24] At the beginning of 2003, Albert Heijn saw its market share fall sharply: 22.8 percent against 24.7 percent a year earlier. [S25] In order to win back customers and leave the expensive image behind, Albert Heijn decided to start a large-scale price reduction in the same year. [S26] The chain permanently reduced the price of thousands of items every so often. [S27] At the end of 2006, managing director Dick Boer announced that Albert Heijn would stop lowering prices. [S28] The price difference with the competitors was successfully reduced by many percent. [S29] The market share was almost 30 percent at the end of 2006. [S30] In 2007, the company crossed the ocean with the opening of a franchise store in Cura\u00e7ao. [S31] This shop remained open until 2016, when it was changed to a different brand. [S32] The company entered the Belgian market in 2011, with the opening of a store in Brasschaat. [S33] Despite the merger of Ahold and Delhaize, Albert Heijn and Delhaize both remained active in Belgium. [S34] Currently Albert Heijn has 60 stores. [S35] After Cura\u00e7ao and Belgium the company entered the German market with their AH To Go formula. [S36] This venture ended in 2018. [S37] ### Simon de Wit",
