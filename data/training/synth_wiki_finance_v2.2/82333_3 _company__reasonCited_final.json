      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S94] 3 Italy (formerly known as Andala) was founded in November 1999 and controlled by Sardinian Internet company Tiscali, Franco Bernab\u00e8 and Sanpaolo IMI. [S95] It was the first Italian mobile operator to offer 3G services (UMTS), launched in March 2003. [S96] As of March 2010, 3 Italy had 9 million registered customers. [S97] It had a roaming agreement with TIM which allowed its customers to get a 2G service when they moved out of 3G coverage, allowing 3 to offer coverage to up to 99.8% of the population on 2G service. [S98] On 22 February 2006, 3 announced the first launch of HSDPA technology in Italy, marketed as \"ADSM\" (a contraction of \"ADSL Mobile\"). [S99] On 14 May 2006, 3 was the first in Italy to launch digital mobile TV using DVB-H technology. [S100] From June 2008 to November 2011, 3 Italy offered free of charge the viewing of Rai 1, Rai 2, Canale 5, Italia 1, Rete 4, Sky Meteo24, Current TV and La7 television channels with DVB-H technology. [S101] In 2015, CK Hutchison Holdings and VimpelCom agreed to merge their telecommunications businesses in Italy \u2013 3 Italy and Wind Telecomunicazioni \u2013 and this was completed in December 2016. [S102] The resulting company, 50% owned by each partner, rebranded as Wind Tre and had around 31 million mobile customers at the start of 2017, making it the country's largest mobile operator. [S103] In 2018, CK Hutchison acquired the 50% stake owned by VEON (formerly VimpelCom), to gain 100% ownership of Wind Tre. [S104] In the Italian market, services are now offered under the unified brand, officially unveiled on 6 March and commercially launched on 16 March 2020. [S105] #### United Kingdom\n\nThree UK launched as the UK's first commercial video mobile network on 3 March 2003, the day that 3G services went live across the country, and handsets went on sale later that month. [S106] On 9 December 2004, Three announced that it was the first network to meet its regulatory requirement of 80% population coverage in the UK. [S107] Three operates 3G, 4G and 5G services, and maintains a national roaming agreement with EE to provide 2G services where 3G is unavailable (until 2006, Three partnered with O2 for these services). [S108] 2G fallback coverage was largely dropped as 3G became ubiquitous. [S109] On 24 March 2015, Three announced its intention to acquire the UK operations of Spanish operator O2 for \u00a310.25 billion but a year later, the EU Commission blocked the takeover. [S110] Three's first retail stores (branded 3Store) opened at the same time as the network launched, in London's Oxford Street and Kensington High Street, and at the Birmingham Mailbox. [S111] Three's handsets and contracts are also sold by mobile telephony chains and independents throughout the UK, as well as online retailers. [S112] In 2005, an expansion of the 3Store portfolio saw stores opened in larger malls throughout the UK, such as the Bluewater shopping centre, and The Mall at Cribbs Causeway near Bristol. [S113] On 24 October 2006, Three announced that it had purchased 95 high street shops from O2 and The Link. [S114] Three's UK division is owned entirely by CK Hutchison Holdings. [S115] In June 2023, it was announced that, subject to regulatory approval Vodafone UK and Three UK will merge to create Britain's biggest mobile network, with Vodafone owning 51% and CK Hutchison Holdings owning 49% of the new service. [S116] The merger received antitrust approval from the UK Competition and Markets Authority in December 2024, and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. [S117] ## Past 3-branded networks\n\n\n### Australia\n\nHutchison launched the Three Australia network in 2003. [S118] It operated a 2,100\u00a0MHz 3G network in a 50/50 partnership with Telstra (the radio networks were shared while the core networks were separate), covering approximately 56% of Australia's population. [S119] The 3G network covered Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, the Gold Coast, Canberra, Geelong, Frankston and Wollongong.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S141] 3 also produced an application called \"Skype on 3\" which brought the same functionality to S60 and J2ME-capable phones (but not iPhone or Android, although some unofficial Android versions were distributed). [S142] Unlike the non-3 versions of mobile Skype, \"Skype on 3\" does not use the phone's data connection for voice calls, but instead places a normal phone call to a special number which 3 make available for this service. [S143] 3 does not charge users for calls to this number. [S144] This service is available in Australia, Ireland and the UK; it has been discontinued in Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden. [S145] A company called iSkoot was behind at least some of the clients and back-end servers but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011. [S146] It appears this shutdown initially affected the J2ME version and some Skypephones (which now show a \"click to upgrade\" link which either doesn't function or takes you to a page saying an upgrade is not available), but some S60 versions were not affected. [S147] Skype have started sending emails indicating the Skype on 3 service will be terminated on 30 September 2014, in spite of Three's original \"free for life\" advertising. [S148] The recommended clients for smartphones will use the phone's data connection which may be liable to charges, instead of the dedicated access number used by the client, which was free to call. [S149] ### Roaming packages\n\nIn February 2007, 3 introduced '3 Like Home', a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any 3-branded network (with the exception of 3 Indonesia) without having to pay additional roaming charges, instead paying the same amount for voice, data, and messaging services as they would do on their home network. [S150] This also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad. [S151] However, pre-pay customers do not benefit fully, as they cannot use each 3 branded network for '3 Like Home'. [S152] This arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks, which provide service to other partners' customers free of internal roaming charges. [S153] This means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how 3's roaming packages and service agreements influenced its market presence in Europe and beyond, and what the limitations were.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Let me start by scanning for mentions of roaming packages and service agreements. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a section about 3 Italy's roaming agreement with TIM, which allowed 2G coverage outside 3G areas, extending their reach. That probably helped their market presence by ensuring broader coverage. Also, in Passage 2, there's a detailed part about the '3 Like Home' service introduced in February 2007. This service allowed subscribers to use other 3-branded networks without extra roaming charges, which would make their service more attractive internationally. The citation here is [S150] to [S153]. \n\nThe influence on market presence would be that these roaming agreements allowed 3 to offer seamless services across different regions, making their network more appealing to customers who travel. The '3 Like Home' service specifically mentions that it's available except in 3 Indonesia, so maybe there were some exclusions. \n\nNow, the limitations. The same '3 Like Home' section mentions that pre-pay customers couldn't fully benefit, which is a limitation. Also, the service was discontinued in some countries like Austria, Denmark, etc., as per [S145]. Additionally, the roaming agreements might have had costs, but the passage says the marginal cost is similar to home network calls. However, the user might be looking for other limitations. \n\nIn the UK, Three had a roaming agreement with EE for 2G services, but that was until 2006 when they switched to O2. Also, the merger with Wind Tre in Italy and the potential merger with Vodafone UK could be factors in market presence, but those are more about mergers than roaming packages. \n\nAnother point is the Skype on 3 service, but that's more about partnerships than roaming. The limitations here might include the exclusions in '3 Like Home' and the discontinuation in certain regions. Also, the fact that pre-pay users couldn't use the service fully is a limitation. \n\nSo, putting this together, the influence was expanding coverage and attracting customers with no extra roaming charges, while limitations include exclusions for pre-pay users and some regions where the service wasn't available. Also, the service was discontinued in some areas, which might have limited its effectiveness there.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the roaming agreement with TIM is [S97], the '3 Like Home' service is [S150]-[S153], and the pre-pay limitation is [S152]. The discontinuation in certain countries is [S145]. Also, the Skype service's discontinuation is [S145], but that's part of the service agreements. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about roaming packages and service agreements. The Skype on 3 might be a service agreement but not directly related to roaming. So focus on the roaming packages like '3 Like Home' and the agreements with TIM and EE. \n\nSo the answer should mention how the roaming agreements (like with TIM and the '3 Like Home') helped in market presence by extending coverage and offering seamless services, and the limitations are pre-pay users not benefiting fully and some regions not having the service."

[S118] It operated a 2,100\u00a0MHz 3G network in a 50/50 partnership with Telstra (the radio networks were shared while the core networks were separate), covering approximately 56% of Australia's population. [S119] The 3G network covered Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, the Gold Coast, Canberra, Geelong, Frankston and Wollongong.",
        "[S141] 3 also produced an application called \"Skype on 3\" which brought the same functionality to S60 and J2ME-capable phones (but not iPhone or Android, although some unofficial Android versions were distributed). [S142] Unlike the non-3 versions of mobile Skype, \"Skype on 3\" does not use the phone's data connection for voice calls, but instead places a normal phone call to a special number which 3 make available for this service. [S143] 3 does not charge users for calls to this number. [S144] This service is available in Australia, Ireland and the UK; it has been discontinued in Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden. [S145] A company called iSkoot was behind at least some of the clients and back-end servers but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011. [S146] It appears this shutdown initially affected the J2ME version and some Skypephones (which now show a \"click to upgrade\" link which either doesn't function or takes you to a page saying an upgrade is not available), but some S60 versions were not affected. [S147] Skype have started sending emails indicating the Skype on 3 service will be terminated on 30 September 2014, in spite of Three's original \"free for life\" advertising. [S148] The recommended clients for smartphones will use the phone's data connection which may be liable to charges, instead of the dedicated access number used by the client, which was free to call. [S149] ### Roaming packages\n\nIn February 2007, 3 introduced '3 Like Home', a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any 3-branded network (with the exception of 3 Indonesia) without having to pay additional roaming charges, instead paying the same amount for voice, data, and messaging services as they would do on their home network. [S150] This also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad. [S151] However, pre-pay customers do not benefit fully, as they cannot use each 3 branded network for '3 Like Home'. [S152] This arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks, which provide service to other partners' customers free of internal roaming charges. [S153] This means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how 3's strategic acquisitions and rebranding efforts, like the Wind Tre merger and 5G rollout, reflect its evolution in the telecommunications market. I need to use the provided supporting context to form an answer with proper citations.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the passage for mentions of acquisitions and rebranding. In Passage 1, there's a section about the merger between 3 Italy and Wind Telecomunicazioni in 2015, completed in 2016, forming Wind Tre. That's a key acquisition. The rebranding as Wind Tre is mentioned in S102 and S103. Also, the 5G rollout is referenced in the UK section, where Three operates 3G, 4G, and 5G services (S108). \n\nAnother point is the 2023 announcement of the Vodafone UK and Three UK merger, which is part of their strategic moves (S116, S117). However, the question specifically mentions Wind Tre and 5G. The Wind Tre merger is clearly a major step, showing expansion and consolidation in the market. The rebranding under Wind Tre likely aimed to unify services and increase market share. \n\nFor 5G, the passage mentions Three's services include 5G (S108), but I need to check if there's more specific info. The context doesn't go into detail about the 5G rollout beyond mentioning it's part of their services. However, the merger and rebranding would have supported their ability to invest in 5G infrastructure. \n\nI should structure the answer to highlight the Wind Tre merger as a strategic acquisition that expanded their customer base and market position. The rebranding under Wind Tre (S102, S103) shows a move towards a unified brand, which is common in mergers to streamline operations. The 5G rollout (S108) indicates their commitment to staying competitive with advanced technology. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the merger is in S101 and S102. The rebranding as Wind Tre is in S102 and S103. The 5G mention is in S108. Also, the UK's 5G services are part of their offerings. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"Wind Tre merger and 5G rollout.\" So the merger is part of acquisitions, and the 5G rollout is part of their service evolution. The answer should connect these actions to their market evolution, like expanding coverage, improving services, and competing effectively.\n\nI need to ensure that each cited sentence is correctly numbered and that the statements are concise. Also, check if there are other relevant points. For example, the 2023 merger with Vodafone is another acquisition, but the question focuses on Wind Tre and 5G. So maybe stick to those. \n\nPutting it all together, the answer should state that the Wind Tre merger (S101, S102) allowed 3 to expand its customer base and become the largest operator in Italy. The rebranding under Wind Tre (S102, S103) unified their brand, enhancing market presence. The 5G rollout (S108) reflects their investment in advanced technology to stay competitive. Each of these steps shows 3's evolution towards a more integrated, competitive, and technologically advanced telecommunications provider."

[S123] The Three and Vodafone networks remained separate until August 2009. [S124] Vodafone phased out the Three brand from late 2011 onwards. [S125] No new registrations to the Three brand were made after this time, and from 30 August 2013, all Three Mobile systems and accounts were closed. [S126] Hutchison formerly operated an Australian CDMA network under the Orange brand name, as Orange One. [S127] It allowed customers to use their 3-branded CDMA mobile phone as a home phone when at home. [S128] Calls made from their mobile were charged at rates similar to those of a landline. [S129] Customers also received a \"Local Zone \" number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. [S130] Should the phone be out of the Local zone, Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the mobile handset. [S131] These plans started at a very competitive price of $10.00 per month, and local calls from the local Zone to a local landline was charged at 20c per local call, making their service cheaper than those of Telstra or Optus. [S132] The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange One devices to roam to the Telstra network. [S133] On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006. [S134] 3 CDMA customers were offered special tariffs and incentives to continue as customers on the 3G network, all customers either moved over to 3's 3G network or to other network providers. [S135] ## Services\n\n\n### Internet access\n\nLike other mobile-provider Internet home pages, 3's portal is 'free to browse' for some content in most 3 countries including Ireland, UK and Australia in most price plans; the user pays a fixed price for each video, text or application downloaded. [S136] Besides that, 3 UK and also 3 Ireland initially made the decision to block direct Internet access from handsets, while 3 Austria allowed access to the Internet since the beginning. [S137] In 2004, 3 released a PC Card 3G Data Card (\"NetConnect Card\") for Windows-based laptops which allows Internet access through 3's network directly from the computer, accompanied by a range of data and business tariffs. [S138] Later, more cards and USB modems for HSDPA were introduced. [S139] ### 3 Skypephones and Skype on 3\n\nIn November 2007, 3 started to sell the Skypephone, which was developed in conjunction with the Chinese phone manufacturer Amoi and Skype, combining the functionality of a UMTS handset with free voice calls and instant messages from Skype. [S140] The phones were sold exclusively by 3 on contract and on a prepaid basis."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the unique features of Three's Internet access policies and how they differed in the UK, Ireland, and Austria.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions a section about \"Internet access\" towards the end. Let me check that part again. \n\nIn the passage, [S136] says that 3's portal is 'free to browse' for some content in most 3 countries, including Ireland, UK, and Australia, with users paying a fixed price for downloads. Then [S137] states that 3 UK and Ireland initially blocked direct Internet access from handsets, while 3 Austria allowed access from the start. \n\nSo the unique features here are the 'free to browse' policy for certain content and the pricing model where users pay per download. Additionally, the difference in allowing direct Internet access via handsets: UK and Ireland blocked it, but Austria didn't. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. The rest of the passage talks about other services like the Skypephones and the CDMA network, but those don't relate to Internet access policies. \n\nSo the answer should highlight the 'free to browse' content, fixed pricing per download, and the regional difference in allowing direct Internet access. The citations would be [S136] and [S137]. \n\nWait, the question also asks about unique features. The 'free to browse' and the pricing model are unique. The blocking of direct access in some regions is another feature. So I need to structure the answer accordingly, citing the relevant sentences."

The user is asking about the role of mergers and acquisitions in shaping 3 Ireland's market presence and how that affected their network infrastructure and services. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Ireland specifically in the section starting with \"Three Ireland launched...\" and there are several citations there. Let me scan through those.\n\nLooking at the passage, under the Ireland section, there's a mention of CK Hutchison Holdings acquiring Telef\u00f3nica's Irish mobile operations, O2, for \u20ac780 million in 2013. The merger was approved in 2014, and O2 was merged into Three Ireland by March 2015. That's a key point about a merger. Then, after the merger, Three Ireland expanded their 4G network in 2014, and later launched 5G in 2020. \n\nSo the merger with O2 would have increased 3 Ireland's market presence by combining resources and customer bases. The integration of O2's operations likely allowed them to expand their network coverage. The passage also mentions that before the merger, Three had a roaming agreement with Vodafone, but after merging O2, they might have had more infrastructure to support their own networks. \n\nThe network infrastructure improvements include the expansion of 4G and 5G services. The merger probably provided the necessary capital and existing infrastructure from O2 to accelerate their network rollouts. For example, after the merger, they launched 4G in more towns and later 5G. \n\nI need to check if there are other mergers or acquisitions mentioned. The passage also mentions \"3 Like Home\" services, but that seems more about roaming rather than mergers. The key merger here is the acquisition of O2. \n\nCitations related to Ireland are [S81] to [S93]. The specific citations for the merger would be [S85] (announcement of acquisition), [S86] (approval), [S87] (merger completion). The network expansions are mentioned in [S88], [S89], [S90], [S91], [S92], [S93]. \n\nSo the answer should state that the merger with O2 in 2013, approved in 2014, allowed 3 Ireland to expand its network infrastructure, leading to 4G and 5G rollouts. The citations would be [S85][S86][S87] for the merger, and the network details from [S88] to [S93]. \n\nI need to structure the statements properly, each with their citations.

[S75] The network was launched with ZTE and according to ZTE, this is the world's first LTE network to use both FDD and TDD at the same time. [S76] Later it was switched to Huawei and Ericsson and as of now in July 2022 with the roll out of 5G the whole network is changed to Ericsson and Nokia Networks, due to the ban of using Huawei to build a 5G-network.

[S85] The European Commission approved the merger in 2014. [S86] The O2 brand was phased out and its operations fully merged into Three on 2 March 2015. [S87] On 27 January 2014, Three launched its 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford. [S88] By March 2014, Three had expanded its 4G coverage to a further 11 towns.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how 3's network strategies in Sweden, specifically using UMTS 900 and LTE 800 bands, contributed to their coverage and competitive advantage. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of UMTS 900 and LTE 800. Looking at the Sweden section, there's a sentence that says, \"In spring 2011 Three started, without Telenor, to build their own 3G Network on the UMTS 900-band which will give a bigger coverage.\" That seems directly related. So using UMTS 900 helped expand coverage. Another sentence mentions, \"UMTS 900 and LTE 800 is rolled out using the same base stations.\" This might indicate efficiency in infrastructure, which could be a competitive advantage.\n\nThen, there's a part about LTE services launched in May 2012, using bands like FDD800. While it doesn't explicitly say LTE 800 contributes to coverage, since LTE is a newer technology, it likely improved speed and reliability. Also, the fact that 3 Sweden covers 98.5% of the population (sentence S72) suggests that their network strategies, including these bands, led to extensive coverage. \n\nAdditionally, the competitive advantage might come from being able to offer better services. For example, the \"3 Like Home\" feature mentioned in S79 allows users to roam without extra charges, which could be a big selling point. However, the question specifically asks about the network strategies with UMTS 900 and LTE 800. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The sentences about UMTS 900 are S69 and S70. The LTE 800 is mentioned in S70 as well. The coverage percentage is S72. So the answer should tie these points together, citing those sentences. Also, the competitive advantage could be inferred from the coverage and the ability to offer services like \"3 Like Home,\" but the direct citations would be the ones about the network expansion and base stations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key ownership changes and mergers involving 3 Indonesia and how these affected its operational structure and market position.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. Let me scan through the passages.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a mention under [S46]: \"In 2013, Charoen Pokphand divested its telecommunication business in Indonesia by selling its share of 3 to Garibaldi Thohir and private equity firm which jointly owned by Patrick Walujo and Glenn Sugita Northstar Group.\" That's an ownership change. Then, in [S47]: \"In September 2021, it was announced that the latter company would be merged with Indosat (which operates the IM3 networks); the merger closed on 4 January 2022 with Indosat as the surviving entity.\" So the merger with Indosat happened in 2022. \n\nNow, how did these events affect operational structure and market position? The context mentions that after the merger, Indosat was the surviving entity, which likely meant that 3 Indonesia's operations were integrated into Indosat. This could lead to changes in market position, possibly increasing market share through combined resources. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the effects, so I might need to infer based on typical merger outcomes. But since the user wants citations, I should only include what's in the text.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's info about ownership structure. For example, [S6] mentions that Hutchison Telecommunications International operates the network in Indonesia. But the key points are the 2013 divestment and the 2022 merger. \n\nI need to structure the answer with these two events, citing the relevant sentences. The operational structure changes would be the merger leading to Indosat's survival, and market position might be affected by the merger, but since the context doesn't specify, maybe just state the merger without explicit effects unless inferred. However, the user might expect that merging with Indosat would impact market position, but without explicit info, it's safer to stick to the given data.\n\nSo the answer should mention the 2013 ownership change and the 2022 merger, citing [S46] and [S47]. The effects on operational structure would be the merger with Indosat, and market position might be implied by the merger, but since there's no direct info, maybe just state the events without specifying effects unless the context provides it. Wait, the question asks how these events affected operational structure and market position. The context doesn't explicitly state the effects, so perhaps the answer is limited to the events themselves, with citations. But maybe the merger's closure in 2022 with Indosat as the surviving entity implies that 3 Indonesia's operations were absorbed, thus changing its structure. However, without explicit statements, I should avoid adding assumptions. So the answer would list the ownership changes and mergers, citing the sentences, and perhaps note the merger's effect on structure as per the citation, but not the market position unless stated.\n\nSo the final answer would have two statements: one about the 2013 divestment and another about the 2022 merger, each with their citations. The effects on operational structure would be the merger leading to Indosat's survival, but since the context doesn't elaborate, maybe just mention the events."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how 3 Indonesia's partnerships with Facebook and Yahoo! Messenger in 2009 differentiated their services in the Indonesian market and the significance of these collaborations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that in 2009, 3 Indonesia launched an unlimited text and MMS service with Facebook, allowing customers to update their status, write on their wall, or upload pictures for free. Then, they also partnered with Yahoo! to offer unlimited chat via SMS and a downloadable app using Yahoo! Messenger. It also states that both were the first of their kind in Indonesia.\n\nSo, the differentiation here is that these partnerships offered services that weren't available before. The significance would be that they were pioneering efforts in the Indonesian market, giving 3 an edge over competitors by integrating social media platforms into their mobile services. This would attract users who wanted free or unlimited access to these services, thereby increasing customer base and engagement.\n\nNow, checking the citations. The relevant sentences are [S41], [S42], [S43], [S44], and [S45]. Each of these sentences talks about the partnerships with Facebook and Yahoo! Messenger, the services offered, and their status as firsts in Indonesia. So, the citations for the statements should include these numbers."

[S77] At the beginning of 2022, 3 Sweden was Sweden's fastest growing mobile operator. [S78] 3 Sweden also operates its own lower-cost flanker brand Hallon, launched in 2013. [S79] 3 Denmark and 3 Sweden has \"3 Like Home\" which makes it possible to use the phone as home in 50+ countries like (Austria, Cyprus, USA, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Ireland, UK, Spain, Portugal, Malta, Puerto Rico, Greece, San Marino, Singapore, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Germany). [S80] Ownership:\n\n* Hutchison Whampoa: 60%\n* Investor: 40%\n\n#### Ireland\n\nThree Ireland launched on 26 July 2005 as Ireland's fourth mobile network operator behind Vodafone, O2 and Meteor. [S81] Service was initially offered as post-paid only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a pre-paid service, known as 3Pay, was announced. [S82] Three operates 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G services. [S83] Until 2015, Three had a roaming agreement with Vodafone to provide 2G coverage where its original 3G network was unavailable. [S84] On 24 June 2013, it was announced that CK Hutchison Holdings would acquire Telef\u00f3nica's Irish mobile operations, O2, for \u20ac780 million, to be merged into Three Ireland upon completion of the deal. [S85] The European Commission approved the merger in 2014. [S86] The O2 brand was phased out and its operations fully merged into Three on 2 March 2015. [S87] On 27 January 2014, Three launched its 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford. [S88] By March 2014, Three had expanded its 4G coverage to a further 11 towns. [S89] In 2016, Three started rolling out 4G+ claiming peak speeds of 225\u00a0Mbit/s. [S90] 4G coverage currently sits at 97.3% as of March 2020. [S91] On 28 September 2020, Three launched its 5G network, claiming 35% population coverage on day one. [S92] Three has stated that this service will be available in 121 locations but coverage is expected to expand over time. [S93] #### Italy",
    "[S94] 3 Italy (formerly known as Andala) was founded in November 1999 and controlled by Sardinian Internet company Tiscali, Franco Bernab\u00e8 and Sanpaolo IMI. [S95] It was the first Italian mobile operator to offer 3G services (UMTS), launched in March 2003. [S96] As of March 2010, 3 Italy had 9 million registered customers. [S97] It had a roaming agreement with TIM which allowed its customers to get a 2G service when they moved out of 3G coverage, allowing 3 to offer coverage to up to 99.8% of the population on 2G service. [S98] On 22 February 2006, 3 announced the first launch of HSDPA technology in Italy, marketed as \"ADSM\" (a contraction of \"ADSL Mobile\"). [S99] On 14 May 2006, 3 was the first in Italy to launch digital mobile TV using DVB-H technology. [S100] From June 2008 to November 2011, 3 Italy offered free of charge the viewing of Rai 1, Rai 2, Canale 5, Italia 1, Rete 4, Sky Meteo24, Current TV and La7 television channels with DVB-H technology. [S101] In 2015, CK Hutchison Holdings and VimpelCom agreed to merge their telecommunications businesses in Italy \u2013 3 Italy and Wind Telecomunicazioni \u2013 and this was completed in December 2016. [S102] The resulting company, 50% owned by each partner, rebranded as Wind Tre and had around 31 million mobile customers at the start of 2017, making it the country's largest mobile operator. [S103] In 2018, CK Hutchison acquired the 50% stake owned by VEON (formerly VimpelCom), to gain 100% ownership of Wind Tre. [S104] In the Italian market, services are now offered under the unified brand, officially unveiled on 6 March and commercially launched on 16 March 2020. [S105] #### United Kingdom\n\nThree UK launched as the UK's first commercial video mobile network on 3 March 2003, the day that 3G services went live across the country, and handsets went on sale later that month. [S106] On 9 December 2004, Three announced that it was the first network to meet its regulatory requirement of 80% population coverage in the UK. [S107] Three operates 3G, 4G and 5G services, and maintains a national roaming agreement with EE to provide 2G services where 3G is unavailable (until 2006, Three partnered with O2 for these services). [S108] 2G fallback coverage was largely dropped as 3G became ubiquitous. [S109] On 24 March 2015, Three announced its intention to acquire the UK operations of Spanish operator O2 for \u00a310.25 billion but a year later, the EU Commission blocked the takeover. [S110] Three's first retail stores (branded 3Store) opened at the same time as the network launched, in London's Oxford Street and Kensington High Street, and at the Birmingham Mailbox. [S111] Three's handsets and contracts are also sold by mobile telephony chains and independents throughout the UK, as well as online retailers. [S112] In 2005, an expansion of the 3Store portfolio saw stores opened in larger malls throughout the UK, such as the Bluewater shopping centre, and The Mall at Cribbs Causeway near Bristol. [S113] On 24 October 2006, Three announced that it had purchased 95 high street shops from O2 and The Link. [S114] Three's UK division is owned entirely by CK Hutchison Holdings. [S115] In June 2023, it was announced that, subject to regulatory approval Vodafone UK and Three UK will merge to create Britain's biggest mobile network, with Vodafone owning 51% and CK Hutchison Holdings owning 49% of the new service. [S116] The merger received antitrust approval from the UK Competition and Markets Authority in December 2024, and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. [S117] ## Past 3-branded networks\n\n\n### Australia\n\nHutchison launched the Three Australia network in 2003. [S118] It operated a 2,100\u00a0MHz 3G network in a 50/50 partnership with Telstra (the radio networks were shared while the core networks were separate), covering approximately 56% of Australia's population. [S119] The 3G network covered Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, the Gold Coast, Canberra, Geelong, Frankston and Wollongong.",
    "[S120] On 9 February 2009, Three and Vodafone announced that they would be merging their Australian operations into a 50\u201350 joint venture called Vodafone Hutchison Australia. [S121] All products and services offered by VHA would be marketed under the Vodafone brand. [S122] The merger was approved by shareholders and regulators on 29 May 2009, and Vodafone Hutchison Australia was established in June 2009. [S123] The Three and Vodafone networks remained separate until August 2009. [S124] Vodafone phased out the Three brand from late 2011 onwards. [S125] No new registrations to the Three brand were made after this time, and from 30 August 2013, all Three Mobile systems and accounts were closed. [S126] Hutchison formerly operated an Australian CDMA network under the Orange brand name, as Orange One. [S127] It allowed customers to use their 3-branded CDMA mobile phone as a home phone when at home. [S128] Calls made from their mobile were charged at rates similar to those of a landline. [S129] Customers also received a \"Local Zone \" number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. [S130] Should the phone be out of the Local zone, Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the mobile handset. [S131] These plans started at a very competitive price of $10.00 per month, and local calls from the local Zone to a local landline was charged at 20c per local call, making their service cheaper than those of Telstra or Optus. [S132] The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange One devices to roam to the Telstra network. [S133] On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006. [S134] 3 CDMA customers were offered special tariffs and incentives to continue as customers on the 3G network, all customers either moved over to 3's 3G network or to other network providers. [S135] ## Services\n\n\n### Internet access\n\nLike other mobile-provider Internet home pages, 3's portal is 'free to browse' for some content in most 3 countries including Ireland, UK and Australia in most price plans; the user pays a fixed price for each video, text or application downloaded. [S136] Besides that, 3 UK and also 3 Ireland initially made the decision to block direct Internet access from handsets, while 3 Austria allowed access to the Internet since the beginning. [S137] In 2004, 3 released a PC Card 3G Data Card (\"NetConnect Card\") for Windows-based laptops which allows Internet access through 3's network directly from the computer, accompanied by a range of data and business tariffs. [S138] Later, more cards and USB modems for HSDPA were introduced. [S139] ### 3 Skypephones and Skype on 3\n\nIn November 2007, 3 started to sell the Skypephone, which was developed in conjunction with the Chinese phone manufacturer Amoi and Skype, combining the functionality of a UMTS handset with free voice calls and instant messages from Skype. [S140] The phones were sold exclusively by 3 on contract and on a prepaid basis.",
    "[S141] 3 also produced an application called \"Skype on 3\" which brought the same functionality to S60 and J2ME-capable phones (but not iPhone or Android, although some unofficial Android versions were distributed). [S142] Unlike the non-3 versions of mobile Skype, \"Skype on 3\" does not use the phone's data connection for voice calls, but instead places a normal phone call to a special number which 3 make available for this service. [S143] 3 does not charge users for calls to this number. [S144] This service is available in Australia, Ireland and the UK; it has been discontinued in Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy and Sweden. [S145] A company called iSkoot was behind at least some of the clients and back-end servers but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011. [S146] It appears this shutdown initially affected the J2ME version and some Skypephones (which now show a \"click to upgrade\" link which either doesn't function or takes you to a page saying an upgrade is not available), but some S60 versions were not affected. [S147] Skype have started sending emails indicating the Skype on 3 service will be terminated on 30 September 2014, in spite of Three's original \"free for life\" advertising. [S148] The recommended clients for smartphones will use the phone's data connection which may be liable to charges, instead of the dedicated access number used by the client, which was free to call. [S149] ### Roaming packages\n\nIn February 2007, 3 introduced '3 Like Home', a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any 3-branded network (with the exception of 3 Indonesia) without having to pay additional roaming charges, instead paying the same amount for voice, data, and messaging services as they would do on their home network. [S150] This also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad. [S151] However, pre-pay customers do not benefit fully, as they cannot use each 3 branded network for '3 Like Home'. [S152] This arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks, which provide service to other partners' customers free of internal roaming charges. [S153] This means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network.",
    "[S154] * At the end of April 2009, 3 UK announced that '3 Like Home' would no longer be available to customers of the 3 UK network from 30 June 2009. [S155] On 7 April 2010, 3 Sweden announced that '3 Like Home' would be discontinued on 23 May 2010. [S156] * On 19 August 2013, 3 Austria announced at a press conference that '3 Like Home' would no longer be available for new customers, following their acquisition of Orange Austria. [S157] Existing plans were unaffected. [S158] * On 30 August 2013, 3 UK launched \"Feel at Home\" for UK customers visiting Australia, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Hong Kong and Ireland, where calls, texts and data are charged at their standard UK rate. [S159] The list of countries was later extended:\n + 4 December 2013 \u2013 Indonesia, Macau, Sri Lanka and the USA\n + 1 July 2014 \u2013 France, Finland, Israel, Norway and Switzerland\n + 1 April 2015 \u2013 New Zealand and Spain\n + 8 September 2016 \u2013 a further 24 European destinations, including Germany, Portugal and Greece\n + 15 June 2017 \u2013 Brazil and Singapore\n* In Sept 2014, 3 Denmark added France, Germany, Norway and Switzerland to its \"Roam Like Home\" package. [S160] + May 2015 \u2212 added Portugal, Malta, Greece, Cyprus and Spain\n + November 2015 \u2013 added USA and Singapore\n* On 1 April 2017, 3 Ireland announced that they were discontinuing their '3 Like Home' service, later announcing they would instead provide a \"Roam Like Home\" experience to Pay As You Go customers, allowing them to use their flexi units and a \"chunk\" of their data within the 30 EEA countries together with Andorra, Monaco, Norway, Switzerland, San Marino and UK. [S161] On Bill Pay Plans this scheme includes the 30 EEA countries together with Andorra, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Gibraltar, Monaco, San Marino, UK and Vatican City. [S162] This was introduced as part of Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 which abolished roaming charges within the European Union."
