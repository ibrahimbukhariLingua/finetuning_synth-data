      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S52] Even in cases where there is no presumption of abuse, it is still possible for a Chapter 7 case to be dismissed or converted. [S53] If the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is below the median income, as discussed above, only the court or the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator) can seek dismissal or conversion of the debtor's case. [S54] If the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is above the median income, as discussed above, any party in interest may seek dismissal or conversion of the case. [S55] The grounds for dismissal under 11 U.S.C.

[S57] 11 U.S.C. [S58] \u00a7\u00a0727(a)(8) was amended to provide that the debtor would be denied a discharge if a debtor had received a discharge in a prior Chapter 7 case filed within eight years of the filing of the present case. [S59] Prior to BAPCPA, the rule was six years between chapter 7 filings. [S60] BAPCPA did not change the rule for the waiting period if the debtor filed a chapter 13 previously. [S61] ### Credit counseling and debtor education requirements\n\nAnother major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. [S62] Section 109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either chapter 7 or chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing the debtor received an \"individual or group briefing\" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. [S63] The new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either chapter 7 or chapter 13 complete an \"instructional course concerning personal financial management.\" If a chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, it constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new 11 U.S.C. [S64] \u00a7\u00a0727(a)(11). [S65] The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months. [S66] Theoretically, if the educational courses prove to be ineffective, the requirement may disappear.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn 2006 more than half of all certified pre-filing counseling sessions were rendered by the three largest agencies: Money Management International, Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta and GreenPath Debt Solutions. [S67] A 2007 GAO report was inconclusive regarding the efficacy of the counseling provisions and concluded that there is no mechanism in place to evaluate it:\n\n> ... [S68] the value of the counseling requirement is not clear. [S69] The counseling was intended to help consumers make informed choices about bankruptcy and its alternatives. [S70] Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that by the time most clients receive the counseling, their financial situations are dire, leaving them with no viable alternative to bankruptcy. [S71] As a result, the requirement may often serve more as an administrative obstacle than as a timely presentation of meaningful options. [S72] Because no mechanism currently exists to track the outcomes of the counseling, policymakers and program managers are unable to fully assess how well the requirement is serving its intended purpose. [S73] > \n> \u2014\u200aGovernment Accounting Office, Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear\n\n\n### Applicability of Automatic Stay\n\nPassage 2:\n[S92] BAPCPA also provided more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge. [S93] The presumption of fraud in the use of credit cards was expanded. [S94] The amount that the debtor must charge for \"luxury goods\" to invoke the presumption is reduced from $1,225 to $500. [S95] The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750. [S96] The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days. [S97] Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 days of filing, the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises. [S98] Prior to BAPCPA, the presumption would not have arisen unless the purchase was for more than $1,225 and was made within 60 days of filing (\u00a7 523(a)(2)(C)). [S99] BAPCPA amended \u00a7 523(a)(8) to broaden the types of educational (\"student\") loans that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy absent proof of \"undue hardship.\" The nature of the lender is no longer relevant. [S100] Thus, even loans from \"for-profit\" or \"non-governmental\" entities are not dischargeable. [S101] ### Lien avoidance\n\nSome types of liens may be avoided through a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. [S102] However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. [S103] The definition of \"household goods\" was changed\u2014for example, by limiting \"electronic equipment\" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. [S104] The definition now excludes certain items such as works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500, with adjustment for inflation (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles. [S105] Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc. [S106] ### Limits to the homestead exemption\n\nUnder the new law, the homestead exemption, which allows bankruptcy filers in some states to exempt the value of their homes from creditors, is limited in various ways. [S107] If a filer acquired their home less than 1,215 days (40 months) before filing, or if they have been convicted of security law violations or been found guilty of certain crimes, they may only exempt up to $125,000 (adjusted periodically), regardless of a state's exemption allowance.(\u00a7 522(p)(1)). [S108] Filers must also wait 730 days before they are allowed to use their state's exemptions. [S109] (\u00a7 522(b)(3)(A)). [S110] There is an exception if the property is \"reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor.\"\n\nThese provisions were largely intended to prevent filers from forum shopping, i.e. [S111] moving assets and domiciles to a state with more favorable exemptions and filing. [S112] ### Exemptions\n\nBAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived \"forum shopping\" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. [S113] Exemptions define the amount of property debtors may protect from liquidation to pay creditors. [S114] Typically, every state has exemption laws that define the amount of property that can be protected from creditor collection action within the state. [S115] There is also a federal statute that defines exemptions in federal cases. [S116] In bankruptcy, Congress allowed states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme. [S117] Opt out states still controlled the amount of property that could be protected from creditors, or \"exempted\" from creditors, in bankruptcy cases. [S118] Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor's domicile for the majority of the 180-day time period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing [\u00a7 522(b)(3)]. [S119] If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking under what circumstances a Chapter 7 case can be dismissed or converted even without a presumption of abuse, and who can initiate that action.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions that even without a presumption of abuse, a Chapter 7 case can still be dismissed or converted. The key sentences here are S52, S53, S54, and S55. \n\nLooking at S52: It states that even without a presumption of abuse, dismissal or conversion is possible. Then S53 and S54 differentiate based on the debtor's current monthly income relative to the median. If it's below the median, only the court or the US trustee can initiate. If it's above, any party in interest can. \n\nS55 talks about the grounds for dismissal under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7707(b)(3), which includes bad faith or the totality of circumstances showing abuse. But the question specifies no presumption of abuse, so maybe that's a separate point. However, the user is asking about circumstances beyond the presumption, so the main points are the income levels and who can initiate.\n\nSo the answer should combine the info from S52, S53, S54. The circumstances are based on the debtor's income relative to the median. The initiators are the court/US trustee if below median, and any party in interest if above. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly attached. Each sentence that provides info should have the relevant citations. The statement about dismissal/conversion without presumption is S52. The income-based initiation is S53 and S54. The grounds in S55 might not be necessary here since the question is about circumstances beyond the presumption, but maybe it's still relevant. Wait, the question says \"even if there's no presumption of abuse,\" so the grounds in S55 might be part of the circumstances. But the user is asking for the circumstances under which dismissal/convertion can happen without the presumption. So S55's grounds (bad faith, totality of circumstances) would be the circumstances. However, the initial part of the passage says that even without presumption, it's possible. So the answer needs to mention both the income-based initiation and the grounds in S55.\n\nWait, the question is two parts: circumstances and who can initiate. The circumstances would include the grounds mentioned in S55 (bad faith, totality of circumstances) and the income levels. But the user is asking specifically under what circumstances even without presumption of abuse. So the answer would be that if the debtor's income is below median, only court or trustee can initiate, and if above, any party. Additionally, the grounds for dismissal under \u00a7707(b)(3) are bad faith or totality of circumstances. But the question is about circumstances beyond the presumption of abuse. So the answer should include both the income-based initiation and the grounds from S55.\n\nBut the user might be looking for the scenarios where dismissal/convertion happens regardless of the presumption. So the answer would be that even without a presumption of abuse, a Chapter 7 case can be dismissed or converted if the debtor's income is below median (initiated by court/trustee) or above median (initiated by any party in interest). Also, the grounds for dismissal include bad faith or totality of circumstances. However, the question is about the circumstances, so the grounds are part of that. \n\nSo structuring the answer: The circumstances are the debtor's income relative to the median and the grounds under \u00a7707(b)(3). The initiators are court/trustee or any party in interest depending on income. \n\nNow, citations: S52 for the general statement, S53 and S54 for the initiators based on income, S55 for the grounds. So the statements would be:\n\n1. Even without presumption of abuse, dismissal/convertion possible (S52).\n2. If income below median, only court/trustee can initiate (S53).\n3. If above median, any party in interest can (S54).\n4. Grounds for dismissal include bad faith or totality of circumstances (S55).\n\nBut the user's question is asking for the circumstances and who can initiate. So combining these into two parts. The answer should mention both the income-based circumstances and the grounds, and the initiators based on income.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. Also, check if S55 is part of the circumstances. The question says \"under what circumstances can a Chapter 7 case be dismissed or converted even if there's no presumption of abuse\"\u2014so the circumstances include both the income levels (as per S53 and S54) and the grounds in S55. However, the income levels might be part of the circumstances, but the actual grounds for dismissal are the bad faith or totality. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the income levels are part of the eligibility for who can initiate, not the circumstances. The user might be asking for the reasons (grounds) for dismissal/convertion, which would be the bad faith or totality of circumstances. But the initial part of the passage says that even without presumption of abuse, dismissal/convertion is possible. So the circumstances are the grounds in S55, and the initiators are based on income. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the passage.\n\nThe passage says: \"Even in cases where there is no presumption of abuse, it is still possible for a Chapter 7 case to be dismissed or converted.\" Then the next sentences explain that if the debtor's income is below median, only court/trustee can seek it. If above, any party. Then S55 explains the grounds for dismissal under \u00a7707(b)(3), which are bad faith or totality of circumstances. \n\nSo the circumstances under which dismissal/convertion can happen without presumption of abuse are: (1) if the debtor's income is below median (but then who can initiate?), and (2) the grounds in S55. But the question is about the circumstances, which might refer to the reasons (grounds) for dismissal, not the initiators. However, the question also asks who can initiate. \n\nSo the answer should have two parts: the circumstances (grounds) and who can initiate. The circumstances would include the grounds in S55 (bad faith, totality of circumstances) and the income levels (but maybe the income levels are part of the eligibility for who can initiate, not the circumstances). \n\nAlternatively, the circumstances could be the situations where the case can be dismissed/converted, which includes both the income-based scenarios and the grounds. But the user might be looking for the reasons (grounds) for dismissal, which are in S55. However, the initial statement in S52 says that even without presumption of abuse, it's possible. So the circumstances are the grounds in S55, and the initiators depend on income. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be: A Chapter 7 case can be dismissed or converted without a presumption of abuse if the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is below the median (initiated by court/trustee) or above the median (initiated by any party in interest), and also if the grounds under \u00a7707(b)(3) (bad faith or totality of circumstances) are met. \n\nBut the user might be looking for the specific circumstances beyond the presumption, which would be the grounds in S55. However, the passage also mentions that the initiators vary based on income. \n\nI think the correct approach is to split into two parts: the circumstances (grounds) and the initiators. The circumstances include the grounds in S55, and the initiators depend on income. So the answer would state that the circumstances are the grounds under \u00a7707(b)(3), and the initiators are court/trustee or any party in interest based on income. But the question is phrased as \"under what circumstances can... be dismissed or converted even if there's no presumption of abuse, and who can initiate this action?\" So the answer needs to address both parts.\n\nSo the final answer would have statements explaining the circumstances (grounds) and the initiators based on income. The citations would be S52 for the general statement, S53 and S54 for the initiators, and S55 for the grounds. However, the user might need to have separate statements for each part."

[S99] BAPCPA amended \u00a7 523(a)(8) to broaden the types of educational (\"student\") loans that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy absent proof of \"undue hardship.\" The nature of the lender is no longer relevant. [S100] Thus, even loans from \"for-profit\" or \"non-governmental\" entities are not dischargeable. [S101] ### Lien avoidance\n\nSome types of liens may be avoided through a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. [S102] However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. [S103] The definition of \"household goods\" was changed\u2014for example, by limiting \"electronic equipment\" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. [S104] The definition now excludes certain items such as works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500, with adjustment for inflation (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles. [S105] Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc. [S106] ### Limits to the homestead exemption\n\nUnder the new law, the homestead exemption, which allows bankruptcy filers in some states to exempt the value of their homes from creditors, is limited in various ways. [S107] If a filer acquired their home less than 1,215 days (40 months) before filing, or if they have been convicted of security law violations or been found guilty of certain crimes, they may only exempt up to $125,000 (adjusted periodically), regardless of a state's exemption allowance.(\u00a7 522(p)(1)). [S108] Filers must also wait 730 days before they are allowed to use their state's exemptions. [S109] (\u00a7 522(b)(3)(A)). [S110] There is an exception if the property is \"reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor.\"\n\nThese provisions were largely intended to prevent filers from forum shopping, i.e. [S111] moving assets and domiciles to a state with more favorable exemptions and filing. [S112] ### Exemptions\n\nBAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived \"forum shopping\" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. [S113] Exemptions define the amount of property debtors may protect from liquidation to pay creditors. [S114] Typically, every state has exemption laws that define the amount of property that can be protected from creditor collection action within the state. [S115] There is also a federal statute that defines exemptions in federal cases. [S116] In bankruptcy, Congress allowed states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme. [S117] Opt out states still controlled the amount of property that could be protected from creditors, or \"exempted\" from creditors, in bankruptcy cases. [S118] Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor's domicile for the majority of the 180-day time period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing [\u00a7 522(b)(3)]. [S119] If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions.",

        "[S52] Even in cases where there is no presumption of abuse, it is still possible for a Chapter 7 case to be dismissed or converted. [S53] If the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is below the median income, as discussed above, only the court or the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator) can seek dismissal or conversion of the debtor's case. [S54] If the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is above the median income, as discussed above, any party in interest may seek dismissal or conversion of the case. [S55] The grounds for dismissal under 11 U.S.C. [S56] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(3) are the filing of a petition in \"bad faith\", or when \"the totality of the circumstances (including whether the debtor seeks to reject a personal services contract and the financial need for such rejection as sought by the debtor) of the debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse.\"\n\n\n### Waiting period between filings\n\nAnother change that resulted from the BAPCPA was an extension of the time between multiple bankruptcy filings. [S57] 11 U.S.C. [S58] \u00a7\u00a0727(a)(8) was amended to provide that the debtor would be denied a discharge if a debtor had received a discharge in a prior Chapter 7 case filed within eight years of the filing of the present case. [S59] Prior to BAPCPA, the rule was six years between chapter 7 filings. [S60] BAPCPA did not change the rule for the waiting period if the debtor filed a chapter 13 previously. [S61] ### Credit counseling and debtor education requirements\n\nAnother major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. [S62] Section 109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either chapter 7 or chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing the debtor received an \"individual or group briefing\" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. [S63] The new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either chapter 7 or chapter 13 complete an \"instructional course concerning personal financial management.\" If a chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, it constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new 11 U.S.C. [S64] \u00a7\u00a0727(a)(11). [S65] The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months. [S66] Theoretically, if the educational courses prove to be ineffective, the requirement may disappear.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn 2006 more than half of all certified pre-filing counseling sessions were rendered by the three largest agencies: Money Management International, Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta and GreenPath Debt Solutions. [S67] A 2007 GAO report was inconclusive regarding the efficacy of the counseling provisions and concluded that there is no mechanism in place to evaluate it:\n\n> ... [S68] the value of the counseling requirement is not clear. [S69] The counseling was intended to help consumers make informed choices about bankruptcy and its alternatives. [S70] Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that by the time most clients receive the counseling, their financial situations are dire, leaving them with no viable alternative to bankruptcy. [S71] As a result, the requirement may often serve more as an administrative obstacle than as a timely presentation of meaningful options.

        "[S92] BAPCPA also provided more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge. [S93] The presumption of fraud in the use of credit cards was expanded. [S94] The amount that the debtor must charge for \"luxury goods\" to invoke the presumption is reduced from $1,225 to $500. [S95] The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750. [S96] The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days. [S97] Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 days of filing, the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how BAPCPA expands the types of debts that are non-dischargeable and specifically about the changes to the credit card fraud presumption.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts, Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me check each section.\n\nLooking at the \"Applicability of Automatic Stay\" section in Passage 2, there's a mention that BAPCPA expanded exceptions to discharge. Specifically, under \"Credit card fraud presumption,\" the text says the amount for luxury goods was reduced from $1,225 to $500, cash advances from $1,225 to $750, and the time period increased to 90 days. This seems to answer the second part about the credit card fraud changes.\n\nFor the first part about expanding non-dischargeable debts, there's a mention of \u00a7523(a)(8) being amended to include more educational loans, regardless of the lender type. Also, in the same section, the expansion of fraud presumption would make those debts non-dischargeable. Additionally, in Passage 1, there's a part about the waiting period between filings, but that's more about discharge eligibility rather than non-dischargeable debts. \n\nWait, the user is asking about types of debts that are non-dischargeable. The credit card fraud presumption is part of that. Also, the student loans under \u00a7523(a)(8) are another example. So I need to cite the relevant sentences. \n\nIn Passage 2, [S93] mentions the expansion of exceptions to discharge, and [S94]-[S97] detail the changes to credit card fraud presumption. Also, [S99] compares the prior law. For the student loans, [S99] and [S100] talk about \u00a7523(a)(8). \n\nSo the answer should state that BAPCPA expanded non-dischargeable debts by including more student loans and changing the credit card fraud presumption. The specific changes to credit card fraud are the lower thresholds and longer time period. The citations would be [S93], [S94]-[S97], [S99], [S100]. \n\nI need to structure each sentence with the correct citations. Let me check each part again to make sure I'm not missing anything. Also, ensure that each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the conditions under which the automatic stay in a bankruptcy case may terminate or not apply under BAPCPA, and how the law addresses the presumption of bad faith in repeat filings.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passage and pick out the relevant sections. Let me start by scanning the text for mentions of BAPCPA and automatic stay termination or exceptions.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a lot of information. Let me break it down. \n\nUnder BAPCPA, the automatic stay can terminate or not apply in certain situations. The passage mentions that BAPCPA limited protections in re-filed cases. Specifically, new \u00a7 362(c)(3) says if a debtor files a chapter 7, 11, or 13 case within one year of a previous dismissal, the stay terminates 30 days after filing unless a motion is filed showing good faith. Also, if it's a third filing within a year, the stay doesn't go into effect at all unless a motion is filed with proof of good faith. There's a presumption of bad faith in repeat filings, requiring clear and convincing evidence to rebut. \n\nThen there are exceptions for eviction proceedings. If the landlord had a judgment before bankruptcy, or if the eviction is due to endangerment or illegal substances, the stay doesn't apply. Also, certain family law cases like paternity or child support are excluded. \n\nThe user also asked about the presumption of bad faith in repeat filings. The passage states that the provision presumes repeat filings are not in good faith, so the debtor must rebut that with evidence. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the termination conditions, sentences [S77] and [S78] talk about the 30-day termination and third filing. [S79] mentions the presumption of bad faith. The eviction exceptions are in [S82]-[S85], and the family law exceptions in [S87]. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about the conditions for termination or non-application of the stay, and the presumption in repeat filings. So the eviction and family law exceptions are part of the conditions where the stay doesn't apply. Also, the notice requirements might be part of the dischargeability section, but the user didn't ask about that. \n\nSo structuring the answer: first, the conditions for termination (repeat filings, 30 days, third filing), then the exceptions where the stay doesn't apply (eviction, certain family cases). Then the presumption of bad faith in repeat filings and the burden to prove good faith. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. Let me check each part again. \n\nYes, [S77] and [S78] cover the termination after one year and third filing. [S79] is about the presumption. The eviction exceptions are [S82]-[S85], but each of those is a separate sentence. However, the user might want them grouped. But according to the format, each sentence is a separate statement. So maybe each exception is a separate statement. But the user might prefer grouping. However, the instructions say each sentence is inside <statement> tags. So I need to split them as per the original sentences. \n\nBut the user's question is about the conditions under which the stay may terminate or not apply. So the termination is in [S77] and [S78], and the non-application (exceptions) are in [S82]-[S85], [S87]. Also, the presumption is in [S79]. \n\nSo the answer should have statements citing these sentences. Let me draft each part step by step."

Let me go through each sentence.\n\nStarting with [S74] to [S81], it talks about the automatic stay under Section 362, exceptions, and BAPCPA's limitations on protections for re-filed cases. Specifically, [S77] and [S78] mention that if a debtor files again within a year, the stay terminates or doesn't apply unless a motion is filed. This seems like an extension of exceptions for repeat filings. Also, [S81] notes an exception where if the prior case was dismissed due to a debt repayment plan, the presumption of bad faith doesn't apply. \n\nThen, [S82] to [S85] discuss eviction proceedings. The stay doesn't stop eviction if the landlord had a judgment before bankruptcy, or if it's due to endangerment or illegal substances. The debtor can contest this, but the landlord must file a certificate. This is another scenario where exceptions apply beyond traditional bankruptcy, affecting the debtor's right to stay evictions.\n\nNext, [S86] mentions that BAPCPA extends exceptions to paternity, child custody, domestic violence, and support proceedings. That's a clear extension beyond traditional cases. \n\nAlso, the notice requirements in [S88] to [S91] about effective notice to creditors. If the debtor doesn't give proper notice, creditors aren't penalized. This affects the debtor's rights because they have to follow strict notice rules, or else the stay might not protect them.\n\nSo, the scenarios are: repeat filings within a year, eviction cases with specific exceptions, and certain family law proceedings. The effects on debtor's rights include needing to prove good faith for stays, facing quicker termination of stays, and stricter notice requirements which could lead to loss of stay protections if not followed.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each scenario and the corresponding citations.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S120] Also, there is a \"cap\" placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case added value to a homestead. [S121] The provision provides that \"any value in excess of $125,000\" added to a homestead can not be exempted. [S122] The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (\u00a7 522(p)). [S123] This \"cap\" would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his/her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition). [S124] ### Additional requirements for filers\n\nThe new law adds a number of new requirements for bankruptcy filers that attempt to make the filing process more difficult and costly. [S125] These additional requirements include:\n\n* *Additional filing requirements and fees*. [S126] The new law increases the amount of paperwork involved in filing and raises the filing fees. [S127] The law also allows filing fees to be waived for debtors earning below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. [S128] * *Increased attorney liability and costs.* Attorneys representing bankruptcy filers are now required to conduct an investigation of their clients' filings and can be held personally liable for inaccuracies. [S129] Most bankruptcy attorneys predicted that this will result in increased attorneys fees and will make attorneys less likely to take on some cases. [S130] In addition, bankruptcy filings are now subject to audit in a manner similar to tax returns. [S131] * *Increased compliance requirements for small businesses*. [S132] The new law increases the bureaucratic compliance obligations and shortens the deadline for Chapter 11 reorganizations involving small businesses, a series of new requirements not applicable to larger businesses. [S133] * *Increased amount of debt repayment under Chapter 13*. [S134] The new law made several changes that effectively increased the amount of debt that Chapter 13 filers will have to repay. [S135] ### Other changes\n\n* The new law allows creditors to pursue collection remedies without court permission in various circumstances such as offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation in all respects except the final turnover of assets from the estate, establishing wage assignments in domestic relations actions, repossessing vehicles and personal property subject to loans or leases 45 days after the first meeting of creditors in cases where no court action has been taken regarding that property, and allowing evictions that completed the court process prior to the filing of the petition or involve endangerment to property or drug use to proceed. [S136] The law also makes it easier for creditors who received preferential payments of less than $5,000 from the debtor before bankruptcy to avoid repaying such payments for the benefit of all creditors. [S137] * The law improves the ability of the bankruptcy estate to reclaim assets placed in asset protection trusts within ten years of filing or paid as employment bonuses to insiders within two years prior to filing. [S138] * The law makes Chapter 12 bankruptcy (farm reorganization) permanent while adding family fishermen, overhauls the treatment of complex financial contracts including many derivative contracts used by hedge funds, and overhauls the treatment of ancillary foreign bankruptcy proceedings. [S139] * The law extends protection to non-ERISA pension plans like private sector 403(b)s and some Individual Retirement Account that ERISA plans had enjoyed thereby making these plans more similar to ERISA plans. [S140] * The law raises the priority status for payment of domestic support obligations (such as alimony and child support) from seventh place to first, only behind the administrative expenses of the trustee. [S141] This means that domestic support claimants get paid before all other unsecured creditors. [S142] ## Legislative history\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n# Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n\nThe **Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005** (**BAPCPA**) (Pub. [S2] L. [S3] 109\u20138 (text) (PDF), 119\u00a0Stat. [S4] 23, enacted April 20, 2005) is a legislative act that made several significant changes to the United States Bankruptcy Code. [S5] Referred to colloquially as the \"New Bankruptcy Law\", the Act of Congress attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some of these consumers may instead utilize Chapter 13. [S6] It was passed by the 109th United States Congress on April 14, 2005, and signed into law by President George W. [S7] Bush on April 20, 2005. [S8] Provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005. [S9] ## Provisions\n\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. [S10] Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it \"more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy.\" The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\u2014under which most debts are forgiven (or discharged)\u2014and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\u2014under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts. [S11] Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following:\n\n\n### Presumption of abuse\n\nPrior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. [S12] BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. [S13] The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. [S14] If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a \"means test.\"\n\nThe most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within 11 U.S.C. [S15] \u00a7\u00a0707(b). [S16] Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"abuse\" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with \"primarily consumer debt\". [S17] The pre-BAPCPA language of \u00a7 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"substantial abuse\". [S18] Under the former \u00a7 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. [S19] The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions. [S20] Post-BAPCPA, \u00a7 707(b) provides two definitions of \"abuse\". [S21] \"Abuse\" may be found when there is an unrebutted \"presumption of abuse\" arising under a BAPCPA-created \"means test\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S22] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S23] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(3)]. [S24] #### Means test\n\nOnly debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under \u00a7 707(b)(2). [S25] Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under \u00a7 707(b)(2), [*see* 11 U.S.C.

        "[S1] Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n# Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n\nThe **Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005** (**BAPCPA**) (Pub. [S2] L. [S3] 109\u20138 (text) (PDF), 119\u00a0Stat. [S4] 23, enacted April 20, 2005) is a legislative act that made several significant changes to the United States Bankruptcy Code. [S5] Referred to colloquially as the \"New Bankruptcy Law\", the Act of Congress attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some of these consumers may instead utilize Chapter 13. [S6] It was passed by the 109th United States Congress on April 14, 2005, and signed into law by President George W. [S7] Bush on April 20, 2005. [S8] Provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005. [S9] ## Provisions\n\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. [S10] Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it \"more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy.\" The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\u2014under which most debts are forgiven (or discharged)\u2014and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\u2014under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts. [S11] Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following:\n\n\n### Presumption of abuse\n\nPrior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. [S12] BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. [S13] The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. [S14] If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a \"means test.\"\n\nThe most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within 11 U.S.C. [S15] \u00a7\u00a0707(b). [S16] Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"abuse\" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with \"primarily consumer debt\". [S17] The pre-BAPCPA language of \u00a7 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"substantial abuse\". [S18] Under the former \u00a7 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. [S19] The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions. [S20] Post-BAPCPA, \u00a7 707(b) provides two definitions of \"abuse\". [S21] \"Abuse\" may be found when there is an unrebutted \"presumption of abuse\" arising under a BAPCPA-created \"means test\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S22] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S23] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(3)]. [S24] #### Means test\n\nOnly debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under \u00a7 707(b)(2). [S25] Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under \u00a7 707(b)(2), [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S26] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(7)]. [S27] This creates a means test \"safe harbor\" for debtors below the state's median income figure."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the homestead exemption cap under BAPCPA interacts with the act's broader goal of increasing barriers to bankruptcy, and the specific exceptions that allow debtors to avoid this cap.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions the homestead exemption cap in sentences S120 to S123. The cap applies if the debtor added value to a homestead within 1215 days before bankruptcy, limiting the exemption to $125,000. The exceptions are transferring from another homestead in the same state or if it's a family farmer's principal residence.\n\nNow, the broader objective of BAPCPA is to make bankruptcy harder, as mentioned in Passage 2, like the presumption of abuse and means test. The homestead cap would be part of that, making it harder for debtors to protect their home equity. The exceptions, though, provide ways around this cap, which might be seen as balancing the barriers. \n\nI need to connect the cap to the overall goal. The cap increases barriers by limiting exemptions, thus forcing debtors to pay more or not qualify for Chapter 7. The exceptions (same state transfer or family farmer) are specific cases where the cap doesn't apply, allowing debtors to avoid it. \n\nCheck the citations: S120, S121, S122, S123 for the cap and exceptions. Also, the broader context of BAPCPA's goals are in Passage 2, like S10, S11, which mention making bankruptcy harder. \n\nSo the answer should state that the cap aligns with BAPCPA's goal by limiting exemptions, thus increasing barriers. The exceptions are transferring within the state or family farmer status. Citations would be S120-S123 for the cap and exceptions, and S10, S11 for the broader objective."

The passage mentions in [S132] that the new law increases bureaucratic compliance obligations and shortens deadlines for Chapter 11 reorganizations for small businesses, which aren't applicable to larger businesses. That's a direct comparison. So the compliance requirements for small businesses are more stringent.\n\nNext, the legislative intent. The passage under \"Provisions\" in [S10] states that many provisions were designed to make it more difficult for people to file bankruptcy. The intent here seems to be to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy system, especially by consumers, and to ensure that debtors can't easily discharge their debts without some repayment. The means test and other requirements are part of this. However, the specific mention of small businesses in [S132] might tie into the idea that small businesses are seen as having more capacity to comply or perhaps as needing stricter rules to prevent misuse. But the legislative history section doesn't explicitly state the intent for small businesses. The general intent is about making bankruptcy harder, but the disparity might be because small businesses are considered more capable of handling the requirements or maybe to protect creditors. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the intent behind the disparity, so I have to stick to what's there.\n\nSo the answer would note that small businesses face more compliance requirements (shorter deadlines, more bureaucracy) compared to larger businesses, as per [S132]. The legislative intent is inferred from the general goal of making bankruptcy harder, as mentioned in [S10], but there's no explicit statement on the disparity's intent.

[S142] ## Legislative history\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n# Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n\nThe **Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005** (**BAPCPA**) (Pub. [S2] L. [S3] 109\u20138 (text) (PDF), 119\u00a0Stat. [S4] 23, enacted April 20, 2005) is a legislative act that made several significant changes to the United States Bankruptcy Code. [S5] Referred to colloquially as the \"New Bankruptcy Law\", the Act of Congress attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some of these consumers may instead utilize Chapter 13. [S6] It was passed by the 109th United States Congress on April 14, 2005, and signed into law by President George W. [S7] Bush on April 20, 2005. [S8] Provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005. [S9] ## Provisions\n\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. [S10] Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it \"more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy.\" The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\u2014under which most debts are forgiven (or discharged)\u2014and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\u2014under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts. [S11] Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following:\n\n\n### Presumption of abuse\n\nPrior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. [S12] BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. [S13] The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. [S14] If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a \"means test.\"\n\nThe most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within 11 U.S.C. [S15] \u00a7\u00a0707(b). [S16] Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"abuse\" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with \"primarily consumer debt\". [S17] The pre-BAPCPA language of \u00a7 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"substantial abuse\". [S18] Under the former \u00a7 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. [S19] The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions. [S20] Post-BAPCPA, \u00a7 707(b) provides two definitions of \"abuse\". [S21] \"Abuse\" may be found when there is an unrebutted \"presumption of abuse\" arising under a BAPCPA-created \"means test\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S22] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S23] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(3)]. [S24] #### Means test\n\nOnly debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under \u00a7 707(b)(2). [S25] Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under \u00a7 707(b)(2), [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S26] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(7)]. [S27] This creates a means test \"safe harbor\" for debtors below the state's median income figure.",
      "chunk_list": [
        "[S120] Also, there is a \"cap\" placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case added value to a homestead. [S121] The provision provides that \"any value in excess of $125,000\" added to a homestead can not be exempted. [S122] The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (\u00a7 522(p)). [S123] This \"cap\" would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his/her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition). [S124] ### Additional requirements for filers\n\nThe new law adds a number of new requirements for bankruptcy filers that attempt to make the filing process more difficult and costly. [S125] These additional requirements include:\n\n* *Additional filing requirements and fees*. [S126] The new law increases the amount of paperwork involved in filing and raises the filing fees. [S127] The law also allows filing fees to be waived for debtors earning below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. [S128] * *Increased attorney liability and costs.* Attorneys representing bankruptcy filers are now required to conduct an investigation of their clients' filings and can be held personally liable for inaccuracies. [S129] Most bankruptcy attorneys predicted that this will result in increased attorneys fees and will make attorneys less likely to take on some cases.

[S135] ### Other changes\n\n* The new law allows creditors to pursue collection remedies without court permission in various circumstances such as offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation in all respects except the final turnover of assets from the estate, establishing wage assignments in domestic relations actions, repossessing vehicles and personal property subject to loans or leases 45 days after the first meeting of creditors in cases where no court action has been taken regarding that property, and allowing evictions that completed the court process prior to the filing of the petition or involve endangerment to property or drug use to proceed. [S136] The law also makes it easier for creditors who received preferential payments of less than $5,000 from the debtor before bankruptcy to avoid repaying such payments for the benefit of all creditors.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the provisions of BAPCPA that help creditors collect debts after a bankruptcy petition and how these align with the act's goal of limiting debtors' access to bankruptcy protections.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts. Passage 1 talks about various changes, including the \"cap\" on homestead exemptions, additional requirements for filers, and other changes. Passage 2 gives background on BAPCPA, its provisions, and the legislative history.\n\nThe question specifically mentions provisions that enhance creditors' ability to collect debts post-petition. Looking at Passage 1, there's a section under \"Other changes\" that mentions creditors can pursue collection remedies without court permission in several circumstances. For example, offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation, wage assignments, repossessing vehicles, and allowing evictions. Also, creditors can avoid repaying preferential payments under $5,000. These points are in sentences S136 and S137. \n\nAnother part in Passage 1 under \"Additional requirements for filers\" mentions increased compliance requirements and the Chapter 13 repayment amounts. However, those might be more about making it harder for debtors rather than directly aiding creditors post-petition. \n\nIn Passage 2, the focus is more on the means test and presumption of abuse, which relate to limiting debtors' access to Chapter 7, pushing them to Chapter 13. But the question is about creditors' ability to collect after the petition. \n\nSo the key sentences are S136 and S137. The user also asks how these provisions align with the act's goal of limiting debtors' access. The answer would link these creditor-friendly provisions to the overall goal of making bankruptcy less accessible by making it harder for debtors, thus forcing them into Chapter 13 or other repayment plans, which in turn might make creditors more likely to get paid. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly numbered. The sentences in Passage 1 under \"Other changes\" are S136 and S137. Also, the part about the homestead exemption cap (S120-S124) might be relevant, but that's more about exemptions rather than post-petition collection. \n\nWait, the question is about post-petition, so during or after the bankruptcy process. The homestead cap is about exemptions, which might affect how much debtors can protect, but not directly about collecting after the petition. The provisions in S136 and S137 are about creditors' actions post-petition without court permission, which directly relate to collecting debts. \n\nSo the answer should include those sentences. Also, the part about domestic support obligations getting priority (S141-S142) might be relevant as well, since higher priority payments could mean creditors (like those with domestic support) get paid first. But the question is about general creditors, not specifically domestic support. \n\nThe user might be looking for the specific provisions that allow creditors to act without court approval. So S136 and S137 are the main ones. Also, the part about the bankruptcy estate reclaiming assets from trusts (S138) could be another point. \n\nBut the question is about enhancing creditors' ability to collect debts post-petition. So the answer should list the provisions that allow creditors to take actions like repossessing, offsetting, etc., without needing court permission. \n\nTherefore, the relevant sentences are S136 and S137. The alignment with the act's goal is that by making it harder for debtors to discharge debts (through Chapter 13 requirements and means test), creditors have a better chance of collecting, as debtors are forced into repayment plans or face more stringent collection methods."

      "answer": "<statement>The provisions of the means test, including 'presumed expenses' and income thresholds, affect the likelihood of debtors being forced into Chapter 13 bankruptcy by creating a presumption of abuse if their income exceeds state median figures, which can disqualify them from Chapter 7 relief. This is determined by comparing the debtor's 'current monthly income' to the median income, with presumed expenses reducing the income to calculate available funds. If the remaining income meets specific thresholds (e.g., $182.50 monthly), a 'presumption of abuse' arises, often requiring Chapter 13 repayment plans instead of Chapter 7 liquidation.<cite>[S38][S40][S46][S47]</cite></statement><statement>The means test's use of 'presumed expenses' and rigid income thresholds drew broader criticisms for ignoring individual circumstances like job loss, medical debt, or predatory lending, which were identified as common causes of bankruptcy.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S28] Current monthly income is defined in 11 U.S.C. [S29] \u00a7\u00a0101(10A) as the monthly average of the income received by the debtor (and the debtor's spouse in a joint case) during a defined six-month time period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case. [S30] Some narrow classes of payments, for example, social security, are excluded from these figures. [S31] Notably, the average income may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. [S32] This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's \"current monthly income\" as \"presumed income\". [S33] If the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. [S34] The applicable median income figure is adjusted by family size. [S35] Generally, the larger the family, the greater the applicable median income figure and the more money the debtor must earn before a presumption of abuse arises. [S36] A chart of the most recent applicable median incomes by state can be found at the US Trustee's website. [S37] This code section then requires a comparison between the debtor's \"current monthly income\" and the median income for the debtor's state. [S38] If the debtor's income exceeds the median income, then the debtor must apply the means test. [S39] For debtors subject to the means test, the test is calculated as follows. [S40] The debtor's \"current monthly income\" is reduced by a set of allowed deductions specified by the IRS. [S41] These deductions are not necessarily the actual expenses the debtor incurs on a monthly basis. [S42] Some commentators have referred to these deductions as \"presumed expenses\". [S43] The deductions applicable in the \"means test\" are defined in 11 U.S.C. [S44] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)(A), (ii)-(iv) and include:\n\n* living expenses specified under the \"collection standards of the Internal Revenue Service\",\n* actual expenses not provided by the Internal Revenue Standards including \"reasonably necessary health insurance, disability insurance, and health savings account expenses\",\n* expenses for protection from family violence,\n* continued contributions to care of nondependent family members,\n* actual expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan,\n* expenses for grade and high school, up to $1,500 annually per minor child provided that the expenses are reasonable and necessary,\n* additional home energy costs in addition to those laid out in the IRS guidelines that are reasonable and necessary,\n* 1/60th of all secured debt that will become due in the five years after the filing of the bankruptcy case,\n* 1/60th of all priority debt, and\n* continued contributions to tax-exempt charities. [S45] An itemized list of the applicable IRS living standards can be found at the US Trustee's website. [S46] A \"presumption of abuse\" will arise if: (1) the debtor has at least $182.50 in current monthly income available after the allowed deductions (this equals $10,950 over five years) regardless of the amount of debt, or (2) the debtor has at least $109.59 of such income ($6,575 over five years) and this sum would be enough to pay general unsecured creditors more than 25% over five years. [S47] For example, if a debtor had exactly $109.59 of \"current monthly income\" left after deductions and owed less than $26,300 in general unsecured debt, then the presumption of abuse would arise, [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S48] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)(A)(i)]. [S49] If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of \"special circumstances\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S50] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)(B)]. [S51] #### Nonpresumed abuse\n\nPassage 2:\n[S171] The 2005 bankruptcy bill was opposed by a wide variety of groups, including consumer advocates, legal scholars, retired bankruptcy judges, and the editorial pages of many national and regional newspapers. [S172] While criticisms of the bill were wide-ranging, the central objections of its opponents focused on the bill's sponsors' contention that bankruptcy fraud was widespread, the strict means test that would force more debtors to file under Chapter 13 (under which a percentage of debts must be paid over a period of 3\u20135 years) as opposed to Chapter 7 (under which debts are paid only out of existing assets), the additional penalties and responsibilities the bill placed on debtors, and the bill's many provisions favorable to credit card companies. [S173] Opponents of the bill regularly pointed out that the credit card industry spent more than $100 million lobbying for the bill over the course of eight years. [S174] There has also been significant criticism of BAPCPA's changes to Chapter 11 business bankruptcies. [S175] Harvey Miller, one of the most-prominent bankruptcy attorneys in the country (particularly in terms of representing corporate debtors) has described BAPCPA as \"ill-conceived.\"\n\nOne of the primary stated purposes of the bankruptcy bill was to cut down on abusive or fraudulent uses of the bankruptcy system. [S176] As Congressman F. [S177] James Sensenbrenner Jr. [S178] (R-Wis), one of the bill's key supporters in the House, argued, \"This bill will help restore responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system by cracking down on fraudulent, abusive, and opportunistic bankruptcy claims.\" Opponents of the bill argued that claims of bankruptcy abuse and fraud were wildly overblown, and that the vast majority of bankruptcies were related to medical expenses and job losses. [S179] These arguments were bolstered by an in-depth study and survey of 1,771 bankruptcy cases by scholars at Harvard University, of whom 931 submitted to interviews. [S180] The study found that \"about half\" of bankruptcy filers in the year 2001 cited out-of-pocket medical bills in excess of $10,000 as a major contributor to bankruptcy (the average bankruptcy filer in this study was a 41-year-old woman with a median income of $25,000, slightly below the personal income average for that year). [S181] Perhaps the most controversial provisions of the bill was the strict means test it established to determine whether a debtor's filing under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code would be considered as an \"abuse\" and therefore subject to dismissal. [S182] This decision was previously made by a bankruptcy court judge, who would evaluate the particular circumstances that led to a bankruptcy. [S183] Critics of the means test, which is triggered if a debtor makes more than their state's median income, argued that it ignored the many causes of individual bankruptcies, including job loss, family illnesses, and predatory lending, and would force debtors seeking to challenge the test into costly litigation, driving them even further into debt. [S184] Besides the stricter means test, opponents of the bill also objected to the many other obstacles the bill creates for individuals seeking bankruptcy protection. [S185] These changes included more detailed reporting requirements, higher fees, mandated credit counseling, and the additional liability placed on bankruptcy attorneys, which critics argued would drive up attorneys' fees and decrease the number of lawyers willing to help consumers file. [S186] These criticisms were partly borne out in the months following the new law, as lawyers have reported that the bankruptcy process has become significantly more arduous, forcing them to charge higher fees and take fewer clients. [S187] One criticism of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult.",

        "[S171] The 2005 bankruptcy bill was opposed by a wide variety of groups, including consumer advocates, legal scholars, retired bankruptcy judges, and the editorial pages of many national and regional newspapers. [S172] While criticisms of the bill were wide-ranging, the central objections of its opponents focused on the bill's sponsors' contention that bankruptcy fraud was widespread, the strict means test that would force more debtors to file under Chapter 13 (under which a percentage of debts must be paid over a period of 3\u20135 years) as opposed to Chapter 7 (under which debts are paid only out of existing assets), the additional penalties and responsibilities the bill placed on debtors, and the bill's many provisions favorable to credit card companies. [S173] Opponents of the bill regularly pointed out that the credit card industry spent more than $100 million lobbying for the bill over the course of eight years. [S174] There has also been significant criticism of BAPCPA's changes to Chapter 11 business bankruptcies. [S175] Harvey Miller, one of the most-prominent bankruptcy attorneys in the country (particularly in terms of representing corporate debtors) has described BAPCPA as \"ill-conceived.\"\n\nOne of the primary stated purposes of the bankruptcy bill was to cut down on abusive or fraudulent uses of the bankruptcy system. [S176] As Congressman F. [S177] James Sensenbrenner Jr. [S178] (R-Wis), one of the bill's key supporters in the House, argued, \"This bill will help restore responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system by cracking down on fraudulent, abusive, and opportunistic bankruptcy claims.\" Opponents of the bill argued that claims of bankruptcy abuse and fraud were wildly overblown, and that the vast majority of bankruptcies were related to medical expenses and job losses. [S179] These arguments were bolstered by an in-depth study and survey of 1,771 bankruptcy cases by scholars at Harvard University, of whom 931 submitted to interviews. [S180] The study found that \"about half\" of bankruptcy filers in the year 2001 cited out-of-pocket medical bills in excess of $10,000 as a major contributor to bankruptcy (the average bankruptcy filer in this study was a 41-year-old woman with a median income of $25,000, slightly below the personal income average for that year). [S181] Perhaps the most controversial provisions of the bill was the strict means test it established to determine whether a debtor's filing under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code would be considered as an \"abuse\" and therefore subject to dismissal. [S182] This decision was previously made by a bankruptcy court judge, who would evaluate the particular circumstances that led to a bankruptcy. [S183] Critics of the means test, which is triggered if a debtor makes more than their state's median income, argued that it ignored the many causes of individual bankruptcies, including job loss, family illnesses, and predatory lending, and would force debtors seeking to challenge the test into costly litigation, driving them even further into debt. [S184] Besides the stricter means test, opponents of the bill also objected to the many other obstacles the bill creates for individuals seeking bankruptcy protection. [S185] These changes included more detailed reporting requirements, higher fees, mandated credit counseling, and the additional liability placed on bankruptcy attorneys, which critics argued would drive up attorneys' fees and decrease the number of lawyers willing to help consumers file. [S186] These criticisms were partly borne out in the months following the new law, as lawyers have reported that the bankruptcy process has become significantly more arduous, forcing them to charge higher fees and take fewer clients. [S187] One criticism of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the means test provisions, specifically 'presumed expenses' and income thresholds, affect the likelihood of debtors being forced into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and what criticisms this aspect of the bill faced.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning Passage 1. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a lot about the means test. For example, [S38] mentions that if the debtor's income exceeds the median, they must apply the means test. Then [S40] talks about reducing current monthly income by IRS deductions, which are called \"presumed expenses\" in [S42]. The deductions are not actual expenses but set amounts. \n\nThe means test leads to a \"presumption of abuse\" if certain income thresholds are met, as per [S46] and [S47]. If that happens, the debtor might be forced into Chapter 13. The passage also mentions that this presumption can only be rebutted under \"special circumstances\" [S49]. \n\nNow, looking at Passage 2, there are criticisms. [S172] states that the strict means test was a central objection, forcing more debtors into Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7. Opponents argued that the test ignored individual circumstances like job loss or medical issues [S183] and [S184]. Also, [S179] mentions that the study showed most bankruptcies were due to medical expenses and job losses, not fraud. \n\nSo, putting this together: The means test uses presumed expenses (fixed deductions) and income thresholds (comparing to median income). If a debtor's income exceeds the median, they face the means test, which could lead to a presumption of abuse, pushing them towards Chapter 13. Critics argued this was too rigid, didn't account for real expenses, and was based on overblown fraud claims.\n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. For example, the effect on Chapter 13 likelihood is in [S172] and [S38]-[S47]. The criticisms are in [S172], [S183], [S184], [S179], etc. I should structure the statements with the relevant citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the 'presumption of abuse' under the means test conflicts with the original intent of bankruptcy law to provide a fresh start, and the legal mechanisms to challenge this presumption.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the means test uses current monthly income after deductions to determine if there's a presumption of abuse. The original intent of bankruptcy law, as per the context, is to give debtors a fresh start. The conflict here is that the means test might prevent that by presuming abuse based on income thresholds, which might not reflect the debtor's actual financial situation.\n\nLooking at the passages, especially Passage 1, there's a mention that the current monthly income is an average and may not reflect actual income at filing. Also, the deductions are set by IRS and not necessarily actual expenses. This could mean that even if a debtor has high deductions, their actual available income might be lower, but the test still presumes abuse. That's a conflict with the fresh start intent because it might force debtors into Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7, making it harder to discharge debts.\n\nThe legal mechanisms for challenging the presumption are mentioned in Passage 1, S49, which says the presumption can only be rebutted with \"special circumstances\" under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7707(b)(2)(B). So the legal mechanism is proving special circumstances.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly referenced. The conflict is discussed in S28-S33, S37-S47, and the legal mechanisms in S49. Also, Passage 2 talks about the 2005 bill's intent and criticisms, which might support the conflict with original intent. For example, S176-178 mention the bill's purpose to cut abuse, while opponents argued it was overblown. The Harvard study in S180-181 shows that many bankruptcies are due to medical issues, not abuse, which ties into the conflict.\n\nSo the answer should state that the presumption conflicts by using average income and fixed deductions, not actual circumstances, thus hindering the fresh start. The legal challenge is through special circumstances. Citations would be from the relevant sections in Passage 1 and 2."

[S190] The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of credit card debt, forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid child support.

[S194] The United States Trustee program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina.

[S157] In the years since 2000, the bill was introduced in each Congress, but was repeatedly shelved due to threats of a filibuster from its opponents and because of disagreements over various amendments, including one backed by Senate Democrats that would have made it harder for anti-abortion groups to discharge court fines related to legal debts incurred from lawsuits filed by pro-abortion groups. [S158] The increase in Republican majorities in the Senate and House after the 2004 elections breathed new life into the bill, which was introduced in its current form by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. [S159] According to George Packer in his book *The Unwinding*, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and Hillary Clinton helped pass this bill. [S160] (Of the three, however, only Biden voted for the final bill.

[S170] ## Criticisms",
      "chunk_list": [
        "[S188] A major target of the bill's opponents were provisions they described as beneficial to credit card companies. [S189] In particular, critics objected to the extension to eight years from six to the time before which debtors could liquidate their debts through bankruptcy, and requirements that those who file for multiple bankruptcies pay previous credit card debt that would have been forgiven under the old law. [S190] The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of credit card debt, forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid child support. [S191] More broadly the bill's critics argued that the legislation did nothing to curtail what they characterize as predatory practices of credit card companies, such as exorbitant interest rates, rising and often hidden fees, and targeting minors and the recently bankrupt for new cards. [S192] The bill's critics argue that these practices are themselves significant contributors to the growth of consumer bankruptcies. [S193] ## Hurricane Katrina bankruptcies\n\nJim Sensenbrenner, Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claimed: \"If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply. [S194] The United States Trustee program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina. [S195] The Justice Department Trustees oversee the administration of bankruptcy law and are able to file the motions necessary to enforce the means test. [S196] Despite these assurances, bankruptcy judges are still able to enforce these rules *sua sponte*. [S197] The Department of Justice also indicated it would not oppose a debtor's eligibility to file bankruptcy because the debtor did not fulfill the credit counseling requirements before filing.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 U.S. [S198] Trustees have the discretion to grant waivers of the credit counseling requirements to debtors.

[S201] ## 2007\u20132008 financial crisis\n\nAs the *Financial Times* noted during the fall of 2008, \"the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company's assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors.\" This radically altered the historic process of paying off creditors and did so just a few years prior to trillions of dollars in assets going into liquidation as a consequence of bankruptcies following the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S202] Some observers have argued that this contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by removing the incentive that creditors would normally have to keep a borrower out of bankruptcy. [S203] Institutions who provided short-term funding to financial firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman through repo lending could abruptly withdraw that funding even if it risked pushing the firms into bankruptcy, because they did not have to worry about tying up their claims in bankruptcy court, due to the new safe harbor provisions of BAPCPA.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n## Case law interpreting the Act\n\n* *Ransom v.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary arguments of BAPCPA's opponents and supporters and how these influenced the bill's legislative history and outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections. Passage 1 talks about the opponents' arguments, like provisions benefiting credit card companies, extending the time to liquidate debts, and expanding exemptions. It also mentions critics' points about predatory practices and the impact on Hurricane Katrina victims. Then there's the part about the 2007-2008 financial crisis and how BAPCPA's changes affected derivatives and financial transactions.\n\nPassage 2 covers the legislative history: the bill's introduction in 1997, Clinton's pocket veto, the role of Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton in the veto, subsequent attempts, and eventual passage under Bush. Supporters were banks, credit companies, and creditors, who wanted to reduce their losses. The supporters argued that lower interest rates would result, but that didn't happen. Instead, profits increased.\n\nNow, the user wants the primary arguments from both sides. Opponents: criticized provisions helping credit card companies, longer debt liquidation time, forcing payment of previous debts, expanding exemptions leading to competition for alimony and child support, and not addressing predatory practices. Supporters: banks and creditors wanted reduced losses, which would lower interest rates (though this didn't materialize).\n\nInfluence on legislative history: The bill was initially vetoed by Clinton, then revived after the 2004 elections. Supporters like Bush and Tom DeLay pushed it through. The outcomes include the bill's passage, but the claimed benefits (lower rates) didn't happen, and there were unintended consequences like the 2008 crisis issues.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements, each citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>. Check for all the key points and ensure correct citations. Also, note the part about the financial crisis and how BAPCPA's provisions affected it, as that's part of the outcomes."

    "[S1] Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n# Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n\n\n\nThe **Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005** (**BAPCPA**) (Pub. [S2] L. [S3] 109\u20138 (text) (PDF), 119\u00a0Stat. [S4] 23, enacted April 20, 2005) is a legislative act that made several significant changes to the United States Bankruptcy Code. [S5] Referred to colloquially as the \"New Bankruptcy Law\", the Act of Congress attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some of these consumers may instead utilize Chapter 13. [S6] It was passed by the 109th United States Congress on April 14, 2005, and signed into law by President George W. [S7] Bush on April 20, 2005. [S8] Provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005. [S9] ## Provisions\n\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. [S10] Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it \"more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy.\" The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\u2014under which most debts are forgiven (or discharged)\u2014and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\u2014under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts. [S11] Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following:\n\n\n### Presumption of abuse\n\nPrior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. [S12] BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. [S13] The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. [S14] If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a \"means test.\"\n\nThe most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within 11 U.S.C. [S15] \u00a7\u00a0707(b). [S16] Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"abuse\" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with \"primarily consumer debt\". [S17] The pre-BAPCPA language of \u00a7 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"substantial abuse\". [S18] Under the former \u00a7 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. [S19] The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions. [S20] Post-BAPCPA, \u00a7 707(b) provides two definitions of \"abuse\". [S21] \"Abuse\" may be found when there is an unrebutted \"presumption of abuse\" arising under a BAPCPA-created \"means test\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S22] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S23] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(3)]. [S24] #### Means test\n\nOnly debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under \u00a7 707(b)(2). [S25] Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under \u00a7 707(b)(2), [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S26] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(7)]. [S27] This creates a means test \"safe harbor\" for debtors below the state's median income figure.",
    "[S28] Current monthly income is defined in 11 U.S.C. [S29] \u00a7\u00a0101(10A) as the monthly average of the income received by the debtor (and the debtor's spouse in a joint case) during a defined six-month time period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case. [S30] Some narrow classes of payments, for example, social security, are excluded from these figures. [S31] Notably, the average income may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. [S32] This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's \"current monthly income\" as \"presumed income\". [S33] If the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. [S34] The applicable median income figure is adjusted by family size. [S35] Generally, the larger the family, the greater the applicable median income figure and the more money the debtor must earn before a presumption of abuse arises. [S36] A chart of the most recent applicable median incomes by state can be found at the US Trustee's website. [S37] This code section then requires a comparison between the debtor's \"current monthly income\" and the median income for the debtor's state. [S38] If the debtor's income exceeds the median income, then the debtor must apply the means test. [S39] For debtors subject to the means test, the test is calculated as follows. [S40] The debtor's \"current monthly income\" is reduced by a set of allowed deductions specified by the IRS. [S41] These deductions are not necessarily the actual expenses the debtor incurs on a monthly basis. [S42] Some commentators have referred to these deductions as \"presumed expenses\". [S43] The deductions applicable in the \"means test\" are defined in 11 U.S.C. [S44] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)(A), (ii)-(iv) and include:\n\n* living expenses specified under the \"collection standards of the Internal Revenue Service\",\n* actual expenses not provided by the Internal Revenue Standards including \"reasonably necessary health insurance, disability insurance, and health savings account expenses\",\n* expenses for protection from family violence,\n* continued contributions to care of nondependent family members,\n* actual expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan,\n* expenses for grade and high school, up to $1,500 annually per minor child provided that the expenses are reasonable and necessary,\n* additional home energy costs in addition to those laid out in the IRS guidelines that are reasonable and necessary,\n* 1/60th of all secured debt that will become due in the five years after the filing of the bankruptcy case,\n* 1/60th of all priority debt, and\n* continued contributions to tax-exempt charities. [S45] An itemized list of the applicable IRS living standards can be found at the US Trustee's website. [S46] A \"presumption of abuse\" will arise if: (1) the debtor has at least $182.50 in current monthly income available after the allowed deductions (this equals $10,950 over five years) regardless of the amount of debt, or (2) the debtor has at least $109.59 of such income ($6,575 over five years) and this sum would be enough to pay general unsecured creditors more than 25% over five years. [S47] For example, if a debtor had exactly $109.59 of \"current monthly income\" left after deductions and owed less than $26,300 in general unsecured debt, then the presumption of abuse would arise, [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S48] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)(A)(i)]. [S49] If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of \"special circumstances\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S50] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(2)(B)]. [S51] #### Nonpresumed abuse",
    "[S52] Even in cases where there is no presumption of abuse, it is still possible for a Chapter 7 case to be dismissed or converted. [S53] If the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is below the median income, as discussed above, only the court or the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator) can seek dismissal or conversion of the debtor's case. [S54] If the debtor's \"current monthly income\" is above the median income, as discussed above, any party in interest may seek dismissal or conversion of the case. [S55] The grounds for dismissal under 11 U.S.C. [S56] \u00a7\u00a0707(b)(3) are the filing of a petition in \"bad faith\", or when \"the totality of the circumstances (including whether the debtor seeks to reject a personal services contract and the financial need for such rejection as sought by the debtor) of the debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse.\"\n\n\n### Waiting period between filings\n\nAnother change that resulted from the BAPCPA was an extension of the time between multiple bankruptcy filings. [S57] 11 U.S.C. [S58] \u00a7\u00a0727(a)(8) was amended to provide that the debtor would be denied a discharge if a debtor had received a discharge in a prior Chapter 7 case filed within eight years of the filing of the present case. [S59] Prior to BAPCPA, the rule was six years between chapter 7 filings. [S60] BAPCPA did not change the rule for the waiting period if the debtor filed a chapter 13 previously. [S61] ### Credit counseling and debtor education requirements\n\nAnother major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. [S62] Section 109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either chapter 7 or chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing the debtor received an \"individual or group briefing\" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. [S63] The new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either chapter 7 or chapter 13 complete an \"instructional course concerning personal financial management.\" If a chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, it constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new 11 U.S.C. [S64] \u00a7\u00a0727(a)(11). [S65] The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months. [S66] Theoretically, if the educational courses prove to be ineffective, the requirement may disappear.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn 2006 more than half of all certified pre-filing counseling sessions were rendered by the three largest agencies: Money Management International, Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta and GreenPath Debt Solutions. [S67] A 2007 GAO report was inconclusive regarding the efficacy of the counseling provisions and concluded that there is no mechanism in place to evaluate it:\n\n> ... [S68] the value of the counseling requirement is not clear. [S69] The counseling was intended to help consumers make informed choices about bankruptcy and its alternatives. [S70] Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that by the time most clients receive the counseling, their financial situations are dire, leaving them with no viable alternative to bankruptcy. [S71] As a result, the requirement may often serve more as an administrative obstacle than as a timely presentation of meaningful options. [S72] Because no mechanism currently exists to track the outcomes of the counseling, policymakers and program managers are unable to fully assess how well the requirement is serving its intended purpose. [S73] > \n> \u2014\u200aGovernment Accounting Office, Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear\n\n\n### Applicability of Automatic Stay",
    "[S74] The automatic stay in bankruptcy is the result of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code that requires all collection proceedings to stop. [S75] There are exceptions, of course, but generally this is the term for the \"relief\" from collection proceedings a debtor receives by filing the bankruptcy with the bankruptcy clerk's office. [S76] BAPCPA limited the protections the stay provides in some re-filed cases. [S77] New \u00a7 362(c)(3) provides that if the debtor files a chapter 7, 11 or 13 case within one year of the dismissal of an earlier case, the automatic stay in the present case terminates 30 days after the filing, unless the debtor or some other party in interest files a motion and demonstrates that the present case was filed in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed. [S78] If the present case is a third filing within one year, the automatic stay does not go into effect at all, unless the debtor or any other party in interest files a motion to impose the stay that demonstrates that the third filing is in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed. [S79] The provision presumes that the repeat filings are not in good faith and requires the party seeking to impose the stay (usually the debtor) to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. [S80] There are exceptions. [S81] Notably, \u00a7 362(i) provides that the presumption that the repeat filing was not in good faith would not arise in a \"subsequent\" case if a debtor's prior case was dismissed \"due to the creation of a debt repayment plan.\"\n\nBAPCPA also limited the applicability of the automatic stay in eviction proceedings. [S82] The stay does not stop an eviction proceeding if the landlord has already obtained a judgment of possession prior to the bankruptcy case being filed, \u00a7 362(b)(22). [S83] The stay also would not apply in a situation where the eviction is based on \"endangerment\" of the rented property or \"illegal use of controlled substances\" on the property, \u00a7 362(b)(23). [S84] In either situation the landlord must file with the court and serve on the debtor a certificate of non-applicability of the stay spelling out the facts giving rise to one of the exceptions. [S85] There is a process for the debtor to contest the assertions in the landlord's certificate or if state law gives the debtor an additional right to cure the default even after an order for possession is entered, \u00a7 362(l) & (m). [S86] In addition, BAPCPA extends the exceptions to automatic stay to certain paternity, child custody, domestic violence and domestic and child support proceedings. [S87] ### Stricter notice requirements\n\nBAPCPA enacts a provision that protects creditors from monetary penalties for violating the stay if the debtor did not give \"effective\" notice pursuant to \u00a7 342, [\u00a7 342(g)]. [S88] The new notice provisions require the debtor to give notice of the bankruptcy to the creditor at an \"address filed by the creditor with the court,\" or \"at an address stated in two communications from the creditor to the debtor within 90 days of the filing of the bankruptcy case. [S89] The notice must also include the account number used by the creditor in the two relevant communications [\u00a7 342(c)(2)(e) & (f)]. [S90] An ineffective notice can be cured if the notice is later \"brought to the attention of the creditor.\" This means that the notice must be received by a person designated by the creditor to receive bankruptcy notices. [S91] ### Dischargeability",
    "[S92] BAPCPA also provided more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge. [S93] The presumption of fraud in the use of credit cards was expanded. [S94] The amount that the debtor must charge for \"luxury goods\" to invoke the presumption is reduced from $1,225 to $500. [S95] The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750. [S96] The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days. [S97] Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 days of filing, the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises. [S98] Prior to BAPCPA, the presumption would not have arisen unless the purchase was for more than $1,225 and was made within 60 days of filing (\u00a7 523(a)(2)(C)). [S99] BAPCPA amended \u00a7 523(a)(8) to broaden the types of educational (\"student\") loans that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy absent proof of \"undue hardship.\" The nature of the lender is no longer relevant. [S100] Thus, even loans from \"for-profit\" or \"non-governmental\" entities are not dischargeable. [S101] ### Lien avoidance\n\nSome types of liens may be avoided through a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. [S102] However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. [S103] The definition of \"household goods\" was changed\u2014for example, by limiting \"electronic equipment\" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. [S104] The definition now excludes certain items such as works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500, with adjustment for inflation (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles. [S105] Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc. [S106] ### Limits to the homestead exemption\n\nUnder the new law, the homestead exemption, which allows bankruptcy filers in some states to exempt the value of their homes from creditors, is limited in various ways. [S107] If a filer acquired their home less than 1,215 days (40 months) before filing, or if they have been convicted of security law violations or been found guilty of certain crimes, they may only exempt up to $125,000 (adjusted periodically), regardless of a state's exemption allowance.(\u00a7 522(p)(1)). [S108] Filers must also wait 730 days before they are allowed to use their state's exemptions. [S109] (\u00a7 522(b)(3)(A)). [S110] There is an exception if the property is \"reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor.\"\n\nThese provisions were largely intended to prevent filers from forum shopping, i.e. [S111] moving assets and domiciles to a state with more favorable exemptions and filing. [S112] ### Exemptions\n\nBAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived \"forum shopping\" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. [S113] Exemptions define the amount of property debtors may protect from liquidation to pay creditors. [S114] Typically, every state has exemption laws that define the amount of property that can be protected from creditor collection action within the state. [S115] There is also a federal statute that defines exemptions in federal cases. [S116] In bankruptcy, Congress allowed states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme. [S117] Opt out states still controlled the amount of property that could be protected from creditors, or \"exempted\" from creditors, in bankruptcy cases. [S118] Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor's domicile for the majority of the 180-day time period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing [\u00a7 522(b)(3)]. [S119] If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions.",
    "[S120] Also, there is a \"cap\" placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case added value to a homestead. [S121] The provision provides that \"any value in excess of $125,000\" added to a homestead can not be exempted. [S122] The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (\u00a7 522(p)). [S123] This \"cap\" would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his/her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition). [S124] ### Additional requirements for filers\n\nThe new law adds a number of new requirements for bankruptcy filers that attempt to make the filing process more difficult and costly. [S125] These additional requirements include:\n\n* *Additional filing requirements and fees*. [S126] The new law increases the amount of paperwork involved in filing and raises the filing fees. [S127] The law also allows filing fees to be waived for debtors earning below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. [S128] * *Increased attorney liability and costs.* Attorneys representing bankruptcy filers are now required to conduct an investigation of their clients' filings and can be held personally liable for inaccuracies. [S129] Most bankruptcy attorneys predicted that this will result in increased attorneys fees and will make attorneys less likely to take on some cases. [S130] In addition, bankruptcy filings are now subject to audit in a manner similar to tax returns. [S131] * *Increased compliance requirements for small businesses*. [S132] The new law increases the bureaucratic compliance obligations and shortens the deadline for Chapter 11 reorganizations involving small businesses, a series of new requirements not applicable to larger businesses. [S133] * *Increased amount of debt repayment under Chapter 13*. [S134] The new law made several changes that effectively increased the amount of debt that Chapter 13 filers will have to repay. [S135] ### Other changes\n\n* The new law allows creditors to pursue collection remedies without court permission in various circumstances such as offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation in all respects except the final turnover of assets from the estate, establishing wage assignments in domestic relations actions, repossessing vehicles and personal property subject to loans or leases 45 days after the first meeting of creditors in cases where no court action has been taken regarding that property, and allowing evictions that completed the court process prior to the filing of the petition or involve endangerment to property or drug use to proceed. [S136] The law also makes it easier for creditors who received preferential payments of less than $5,000 from the debtor before bankruptcy to avoid repaying such payments for the benefit of all creditors. [S137] * The law improves the ability of the bankruptcy estate to reclaim assets placed in asset protection trusts within ten years of filing or paid as employment bonuses to insiders within two years prior to filing. [S138] * The law makes Chapter 12 bankruptcy (farm reorganization) permanent while adding family fishermen, overhauls the treatment of complex financial contracts including many derivative contracts used by hedge funds, and overhauls the treatment of ancillary foreign bankruptcy proceedings. [S139] * The law extends protection to non-ERISA pension plans like private sector 403(b)s and some Individual Retirement Account that ERISA plans had enjoyed thereby making these plans more similar to ERISA plans. [S140] * The law raises the priority status for payment of domestic support obligations (such as alimony and child support) from seventh place to first, only behind the administrative expenses of the trustee. [S141] This means that domestic support claimants get paid before all other unsecured creditors. [S142] ## Legislative history",
    "[S143] The 2005 bankruptcy bill was actually first drafted in 1997 and first introduced in 1998. [S144] The United States House of Representatives approved a version titled the \"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999\" and the Senate approved a slightly different version in 2000. [S145] After the differences in the bills were reconciled, Congress passed the \"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000\". [S146] President Clinton, however, employed what is known as a \"pocket veto\" by waiting for the lame duck congressional session to adjourn without signing the bill, a legislative maneuver tantamount to a veto. [S147] Professor Elizabeth Warren, a member of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission at that time, briefed First Lady Clinton on negative effects of the bill; according to Warren, after the briefing:\n\n> President Clinton had been showing that this is another way that he could be helpful to business. [S148] It wasn't a very high visibility bill. [S149] And when Mrs. [S150] Clinton came back with a little better understanding of how it all worked, they reversed course, and they reversed course fast. [S151] And indeed, the proof is in the pudding. [S152] > The last bill that came before President Clinton was that bankruptcy bill that was passed by the House and the Senate in 2000 and he vetoed it. [S153] And in her autobiography, Mrs. [S154] Clinton took credit for that veto and she rightly should. [S155] She turned around a whole administration on the subject of bankruptcy. [S156] She got it. [S157] In the years since 2000, the bill was introduced in each Congress, but was repeatedly shelved due to threats of a filibuster from its opponents and because of disagreements over various amendments, including one backed by Senate Democrats that would have made it harder for anti-abortion groups to discharge court fines related to legal debts incurred from lawsuits filed by pro-abortion groups. [S158] The increase in Republican majorities in the Senate and House after the 2004 elections breathed new life into the bill, which was introduced in its current form by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. [S159] According to George Packer in his book *The Unwinding*, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and Hillary Clinton helped pass this bill. [S160] (Of the three, however, only Biden voted for the final bill. [S161] Dodd voted against, and Clinton did not vote.) The bill was supported by President George W. [S162] Bush. [S163] Tom DeLay also championed the legislation. [S164] The bill passed by large margins, 302\u2013126 in the House and 74\u201325 in the Senate, and was signed into law by President Bush. [S165] ## Support\n\nSupport for the act mostly came from banks, credit card companies, and other creditors. [S166] Since banks, credit companies and other creditors are the ones who must bear the losses for debts discharged through bankruptcy, their lobby power was a great supporting factor to eventually prevailing and getting Congress to pass the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. [S167] It was widely claimed by advocates of BAPCPA that its passage would reduce losses to creditors such as credit card companies, and that those creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers in the form of lower interest rates. [S168] These claims turned out to be false. [S169] After BAPCPA passed, although credit card company losses decreased, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared. [S170] ## Criticisms",
    "[S171] The 2005 bankruptcy bill was opposed by a wide variety of groups, including consumer advocates, legal scholars, retired bankruptcy judges, and the editorial pages of many national and regional newspapers. [S172] While criticisms of the bill were wide-ranging, the central objections of its opponents focused on the bill's sponsors' contention that bankruptcy fraud was widespread, the strict means test that would force more debtors to file under Chapter 13 (under which a percentage of debts must be paid over a period of 3\u20135 years) as opposed to Chapter 7 (under which debts are paid only out of existing assets), the additional penalties and responsibilities the bill placed on debtors, and the bill's many provisions favorable to credit card companies. [S173] Opponents of the bill regularly pointed out that the credit card industry spent more than $100 million lobbying for the bill over the course of eight years. [S174] There has also been significant criticism of BAPCPA's changes to Chapter 11 business bankruptcies. [S175] Harvey Miller, one of the most-prominent bankruptcy attorneys in the country (particularly in terms of representing corporate debtors) has described BAPCPA as \"ill-conceived.\"\n\nOne of the primary stated purposes of the bankruptcy bill was to cut down on abusive or fraudulent uses of the bankruptcy system. [S176] As Congressman F. [S177] James Sensenbrenner Jr. [S178] (R-Wis), one of the bill's key supporters in the House, argued, \"This bill will help restore responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system by cracking down on fraudulent, abusive, and opportunistic bankruptcy claims.\" Opponents of the bill argued that claims of bankruptcy abuse and fraud were wildly overblown, and that the vast majority of bankruptcies were related to medical expenses and job losses. [S179] These arguments were bolstered by an in-depth study and survey of 1,771 bankruptcy cases by scholars at Harvard University, of whom 931 submitted to interviews. [S180] The study found that \"about half\" of bankruptcy filers in the year 2001 cited out-of-pocket medical bills in excess of $10,000 as a major contributor to bankruptcy (the average bankruptcy filer in this study was a 41-year-old woman with a median income of $25,000, slightly below the personal income average for that year). [S181] Perhaps the most controversial provisions of the bill was the strict means test it established to determine whether a debtor's filing under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code would be considered as an \"abuse\" and therefore subject to dismissal. [S182] This decision was previously made by a bankruptcy court judge, who would evaluate the particular circumstances that led to a bankruptcy. [S183] Critics of the means test, which is triggered if a debtor makes more than their state's median income, argued that it ignored the many causes of individual bankruptcies, including job loss, family illnesses, and predatory lending, and would force debtors seeking to challenge the test into costly litigation, driving them even further into debt. [S184] Besides the stricter means test, opponents of the bill also objected to the many other obstacles the bill creates for individuals seeking bankruptcy protection. [S185] These changes included more detailed reporting requirements, higher fees, mandated credit counseling, and the additional liability placed on bankruptcy attorneys, which critics argued would drive up attorneys' fees and decrease the number of lawyers willing to help consumers file. [S186] These criticisms were partly borne out in the months following the new law, as lawyers have reported that the bankruptcy process has become significantly more arduous, forcing them to charge higher fees and take fewer clients. [S187] One criticism of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult.",
    "[S188] A major target of the bill's opponents were provisions they described as beneficial to credit card companies. [S189] In particular, critics objected to the extension to eight years from six to the time before which debtors could liquidate their debts through bankruptcy, and requirements that those who file for multiple bankruptcies pay previous credit card debt that would have been forgiven under the old law. [S190] The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of credit card debt, forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid child support. [S191] More broadly the bill's critics argued that the legislation did nothing to curtail what they characterize as predatory practices of credit card companies, such as exorbitant interest rates, rising and often hidden fees, and targeting minors and the recently bankrupt for new cards. [S192] The bill's critics argue that these practices are themselves significant contributors to the growth of consumer bankruptcies. [S193] ## Hurricane Katrina bankruptcies\n\nJim Sensenbrenner, Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claimed: \"If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply. [S194] The United States Trustee program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina. [S195] The Justice Department Trustees oversee the administration of bankruptcy law and are able to file the motions necessary to enforce the means test. [S196] Despite these assurances, bankruptcy judges are still able to enforce these rules *sua sponte*. [S197] The Department of Justice also indicated it would not oppose a debtor's eligibility to file bankruptcy because the debtor did not fulfill the credit counseling requirements before filing.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 U.S. [S198] Trustees have the discretion to grant waivers of the credit counseling requirements to debtors. [S199] *See* 11 U.S.C. [S200] \u00a7\u00a0109(h)(2). [S201] ## 2007\u20132008 financial crisis\n\nAs the *Financial Times* noted during the fall of 2008, \"the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company's assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors.\" This radically altered the historic process of paying off creditors and did so just a few years prior to trillions of dollars in assets going into liquidation as a consequence of bankruptcies following the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S202] Some observers have argued that this contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by removing the incentive that creditors would normally have to keep a borrower out of bankruptcy. [S203] Institutions who provided short-term funding to financial firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman through repo lending could abruptly withdraw that funding even if it risked pushing the firms into bankruptcy, because they did not have to worry about tying up their claims in bankruptcy court, due to the new safe harbor provisions of BAPCPA.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n## Case law interpreting the Act\n\n* *Ransom v. [S204] FIA Card Services, N. [S205] A.*, 562 U.S. [S206] \\_\\_\\_ (2011), involving the Chapter 13 means test"
