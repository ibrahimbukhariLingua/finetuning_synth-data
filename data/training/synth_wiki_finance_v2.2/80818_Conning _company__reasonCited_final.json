      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Conning (company)\n\n\n# Conning (company)\n\n\n\n**Conning** is a global investment management firm serving the insurance industry. [S2] Conning supports institutional investors, including pension plans, with investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, and industry research. [S3] Founded in 1912, Conning has offices in Boston, Cologne, Hartford, Hong Kong, London, New York and Tokyo. [S4] ## Company history\n\nConning & Company was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1912 by William Smith Conning. [S5] Conning was born in Slingerlands, New York, just outside of Albany on September 16, 1877, and moved to Hartford in 1904 to serve as office manager for investment firm Hornblower & Weeks. [S6] He founded the firm together with William C. [S7] Goeben, a colleague of Conning's at Hornblower & Weeks. [S8] The firm embraced the technology of the day, providing election returns to clients by wire from New York during President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s t narrow, re-election victory in 1916 over Charles Evans Hughes. [S9] In 1920, Conning & Company installed a bond ticker and moved into a newly constructed building on Lewis Street in Hartford. [S10] In January 1923, Conning Realty Company was incorporated for $50,000 by Conning, Goeben, Mitchell and Charles T. [S11] Treadway. [S12] In 1935, a year shy of celebrating its 60th anniversary, the Hartford Stock Exchange closed after failing to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the firm was no longer registered with the exchange. [S13] Two of the oldest investment firms in Hartford joined forces when Conning & Company merged with Ballard & Company on December 4, 1942, to become Conning & Company and Ballard. [S14] In late 1948, William S. [S15] Conning\u2019s wife, Carolyn Dermott Conning, died. [S16] Four months later, the widowed Conning died at the age of 71, leaving behind the couple\u2019s daughter, Katharine S. [S17] Conning, who died in 1996. [S18] ### Early activities\n\nIn 1950, Conning & Company began offering insurance stock research and advice to institutional investors. [S19] After Conning & Company celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1962, the firm continued to emphasize research and education. [S20] In 1968, the firm became a Registered Investment Advisor with the SEC. [S21] During 1970, the firm branched out into consulting and strategic industry research for senior insurance executives. [S22] By 1974, the firm had 13 Partners and 60 employees operating in Hartford with a subsidiary, Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc., headquartered in London. [S23] The subsidiary provided research on U.S. [S24] insurance companies and banks to institutional investors throughout Europe. [S25] ### Mergers and acquisitions (1985\u20131999)\n\nIn the mid- to late-1980s, the firm formed two new groups: a venture capital unit to raise private equity for insurance investments and an asset management group to manage insurance companies\u2019 assets. [S26] In 1995, Conning Corp. [S27] and its subsidiary Conning & Company. [S28] were acquired by General American Life Insurance Company (GALIC). [S29] Conning Corp.\u2019s asset management business was merged with General American Investment Management Company (GAIMCO) to form Conning Asset Management Company (now known as Conning, Inc.). [S30] In 1997, GALIC took Conning Corp. [S31] public and completed an initial public offering of 2.875 million shares in 1997. [S32] The company began trading on NASDAQ as CNNG. [S33] In August 1998, Conning Asset Management acquired Schroeder Mortgage Associates LP, a small real estate investment company in Manhattan. [S34] Four months later, Conning Corp. [S35] and Conning Asset Management acquired Noddings Investment Group, a small convertible bond asset manager and broker-dealer located near Chicago. [S36] Conning Corp. [S37] also acquired the insurance company and high-grade fixed income management business of TCW Group, based in Los Angeles. [S38] In 1999, Forbes ranked Conning Corp. [S39] 82nd on its list of 200 Best Small Companies. [S40] ### Expansion (2000\u20132003)\n\nPassage 2:\n[S41] In 2000, MetLife acquired Conning Corp. [S42] and took it private, paying $12.50 a share in cash. [S43] Later that year, Conning acquired Charter Oak Asset Management of Hartford, and also spun out its MarketStance business in an MBO. [S44] Swiss Reinsurance Company acquired Conning Corp. [S45] in July 2001 to build the third-party asset management business. [S46] As part of these changes, Conning & Company\u2019s broker-dealer business was shut down and the remnants were combined with Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc.\u2019s similar business; also, its insurance industry research and publications business was transferred to Fox-Pitt Kelton management. [S47] In 2002, Swiss Re Asset Management's Americas\u2019 asset liability management unit came under Conning's control with 20 employees relocating to Hartford.

[S51] Although Swiss Re continued to own the entities, they were renamed Conning Asset Management (Europe) Limited located in Dublin and Conning Asset Management Limited located in London. [S52] In 2004, Conning Corp. [S53] and Conning, Inc. [S54] merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc.

[S57] ### New ownership (2009\u2013present)\n\nIn October 2009, Aquiline Capital Partners acquired Conning & Company from Swiss Reinsurance Company. [S58] In 2010, Conning launched its High-Dividend Equity Fund strategy and acquired the assets of DFA Capital Management, a market leader in economic, capital markets and risk modeling software. [S59] The deal included some of DFA's management team, staff, and ADVISE and GEMS software suites. [S60] On September 20, 2011, Conning and Cathay Financial Holdings received regulatory approval for their previously announced joint venture to form a new Hong Kong-headquartered asset management company, now known as Conning Asia Pacific Limited. [S61] Later that year, Conning and The Phoenix Companies entered into a multiyear investment agreement under which Conning acquired Goodwin Capital Advisers, Inc. [S62] and took management control of the Phoenix's publicly traded fixed income general accounts insurance assets totaling approximately $8 billion. [S63] In June 2014, Conning completed the acquisition of certain assets of Brookfield Investment Management Inc.\u2019s Core Fixed Income Insurance Business. [S64] The investment team managing these assets joined Conning in its newly formed midtown Manhattan investment office. [S65] On September 18, 2015, Cathay Financial Holding Co., Ltd. [S66] (TWSE: 2882), completed its acquisition of Conning through its subsidiary, Cathay Life Insurance Co, Ltd. [S67] This transaction provided complete continuity for Conning and its clients. [S68] On January 31, 2016, Conning acquired Octagon Credit Investors, LLC (\"Octagon\"), a U.S.-based investment manager with expertise in collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans and high yield bonds. [S69] In June 2020, Conning Holdings Limited completed the acquisition of a majority interest in the Danish asset management firm Global Evolution. [S70] In July 2023, Italian insurance group Assicurazioni Generali agreed to acquire Conning as part of a partnership with Taiwan's Cathay Financial Holding unit Cathay Life Insurance.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the major ownership changes and mergers that shaped Conning's structure from the 1990s to the 2010s and how these influenced its current operational framework.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage is divided into sections, so I'll start by scanning each part for relevant information. \n\nLooking at the \"Mergers and acquisitions (1985\u20131999)\" section, there's mention of Conning Corp. and its subsidiary being acquired by General American Life Insurance Company (GALIC) in 1995. Then, in 1997, GALIC took Conning public with an IPO. Also, in 1998 and 1999, there are acquisitions of Schroeder Mortgage Associates and Noddings Investment Group, plus the TCW Group's business. These events probably expanded Conning's asset management capabilities.\n\nNext, the \"Expansion (2000\u20132003)\" section mentions MetLife acquiring Conning Corp. in 2000, taking it private. Then Swiss Reinsurance acquired Conning in 2001. There's also the spin-off of MarketStance and the merging of broker-dealer businesses. In 2004, there's a merger of Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. into Conning & Company, leading to the name change to Conning, Inc. These steps likely restructured the company's divisions and operations.\n\nMoving to the \"New ownership (2009\u2013present)\" section, Aquiline Capital Partners bought Conning from Swiss Re in 2009. Then in 2010, they acquired DFA Capital Management, which added software and expertise. The 2011 joint venture with Cathay Financial in Hong Kong and the 2014 acquisition of Brookfield's business expanded their geographic and product offerings. The 2015 acquisition by Cathay Financial Holding and the 2016 purchase of Octagon Credit Investors further diversified their services. The 2020 acquisition of Global Evolution and the 2023 completion of the Generali acquisition are recent changes, but the question is up to the 2010s, so maybe focus on up to 2015.\n\nNow, I need to structure these events into major ownership changes and mergers. Each event should be cited with the relevant sentence numbers. Also, the influence on the current operational framework would involve things like expanded services, geographic presence, product diversification, and strategic partnerships.\n\nI should check each event and note the citations. For example, the 1995 acquisition by GALIC is [S29], the 1997 IPO [S31], 1998 and 1999 acquisitions [S34][S36][S38]. Then MetLife's 2000 acquisition [S41], Swiss Re in 2001 [S45], the 2004 merger [S54], 2009 Aquiline [S58], 2010 DFA [S59], 2011 joint venture [S61], 2014 Brookfield [S64], 2015 Cathay acquisition [S66], and 2016 Octagon [S69]. \n\nThe influence would include becoming a larger player through acquisitions, expanding into different markets (like Hong Kong, Europe), enhancing their asset management capabilities, integrating advanced software, and forming strategic alliances. These changes likely made Conning more diversified and globally present, which is part of their current operational framework.\n\nI need to make sure each statement in the answer is properly cited and that the sentences are structured correctly. Also, check if all relevant events are covered and that the citations are accurate. Avoid including events outside the 1990s to 2010s, so the 2020 and 2023 events might be out of scope. But the user said up to the 2010s, so maybe up to 2015 is okay. The 2015 acquisition is within the 2010s."

        "[S1] Conning (company)\n\n\n# Conning (company)\n\n\n\n**Conning** is a global investment management firm serving the insurance industry. [S2] Conning supports institutional investors, including pension plans, with investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, and industry research. [S3] Founded in 1912, Conning has offices in Boston, Cologne, Hartford, Hong Kong, London, New York and Tokyo. [S4] ## Company history\n\nConning & Company was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1912 by William Smith Conning. [S5] Conning was born in Slingerlands, New York, just outside of Albany on September 16, 1877, and moved to Hartford in 1904 to serve as office manager for investment firm Hornblower & Weeks. [S6] He founded the firm together with William C. [S7] Goeben, a colleague of Conning's at Hornblower & Weeks. [S8] The firm embraced the technology of the day, providing election returns to clients by wire from New York during President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s t narrow, re-election victory in 1916 over Charles Evans Hughes. [S9] In 1920, Conning & Company installed a bond ticker and moved into a newly constructed building on Lewis Street in Hartford. [S10] In January 1923, Conning Realty Company was incorporated for $50,000 by Conning, Goeben, Mitchell and Charles T. [S11] Treadway. [S12] In 1935, a year shy of celebrating its 60th anniversary, the Hartford Stock Exchange closed after failing to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the firm was no longer registered with the exchange. [S13] Two of the oldest investment firms in Hartford joined forces when Conning & Company merged with Ballard & Company on December 4, 1942, to become Conning & Company and Ballard. [S14] In late 1948, William S. [S15] Conning\u2019s wife, Carolyn Dermott Conning, died. [S16] Four months later, the widowed Conning died at the age of 71, leaving behind the couple\u2019s daughter, Katharine S. [S17] Conning, who died in 1996.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Conning's expansion into international markets like the UK and Hong Kong aligned with its strategic business objectives and which subsidiaries or offices were established.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, and I need to check both. Let me start by scanning for mentions of international expansion, specifically the UK and Hong Kong.\n\nLooking at the first passage, under the \"Early activities\" section, there's a mention of a subsidiary, Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc., headquartered in London in 1974. That's the UK. The citation here is [S22] and [S23]. Then, in the \"New ownership (2009\u2013present)\" section, there's a part about a joint venture in Hong Kong: \"Conning Asia Pacific Limited\" mentioned in [S61]. Also, in the first passage, [S3] mentions offices in London and Hong Kong, but that's part of the general offices list. \n\nWait, the question is about expansion into international markets and how it aligns with strategic objectives. The strategic objectives might relate to serving institutional investors, expanding their asset management, and research services. The subsidiaries established would be Fox-Pitt Kelton in London and Conning Asia Pacific Limited in Hong Kong. Also, there's a mention of Conning Asset Management (Europe) Limited in Dublin and Conning Asset Management Limited in London in [S51], but that's under the 2003 section. \n\nBut the user specifically asked about the UK and Hong Kong. So for the UK, Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc. in London, and later Conning Asset Management Limited in London. For Hong Kong, the joint venture in [S61] leading to Conning Asia Pacific Limited. Also, the initial offices in [S3] include Hong Kong and London, but that's from 1912? Wait, [S3] says \"Founded in 1912, Conning has offices in Boston, Cologne, Hartford, Hong Kong, London, New York and Tokyo.\" So that's early on. But the expansion into these markets might have been part of their strategy to serve international clients, especially in asset management and research.\n\nThe strategic objectives would be to expand their services, increase market presence, and offer investment products globally. The subsidiaries established would be Fox-Pitt Kelton in London (1974), Conning Asia Pacific Limited in Hong Kong (2011), and possibly others mentioned later like Conning Asset Management Limited in London. However, the user might be looking for the specific ones mentioned in the context. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. For the UK, [S22][S23][S51], and for Hong Kong [S61]. Also, [S3] mentions the offices, but that's part of the general info. The answer should tie the expansion to their objectives of serving institutional investors, providing research, and asset management. So the alignment is that by establishing these subsidiaries, Conning could better serve international clients, expand their asset management services, and conduct research in those regions."

[S54] merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about key acquisitions in the 2000s and 2010s that enhanced Conning's capabilities in risk modeling and asset management, along with the outcomes.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage is divided into two parts, with references from S1 to S71. The user is specifically interested in the 2000s and 2010s, so I should focus on those time frames.\n\nLooking at the \"Mergers and acquisitions (1985\u20131999)\" section, but that's before 2000. Then there's \"Expansion (2000\u20132003)\" which is early 2000s. Let me check there. \n\nIn S41, MetLife acquired Conning Corp. in 2000. But the question is about acquisitions that enhanced their capabilities. Then in S43, Conning acquired Charter Oak Asset Management. But I need to see if these acquisitions relate to risk modeling or asset management. \n\nNext, under \"New ownership (2009\u2013present)\" there's more info. In S59, in 2010, Conning acquired DFA Capital Management, which is mentioned as a market leader in economic, capital markets, and risk modeling software. That's a key point. The deal included software suites like ADVISE and GEMS, which would enhance their risk modeling. \n\nThen in S62, in 2011, Conning acquired Goodwin Capital Advisers, Inc., which relates to fixed income general accounts. That's asset management. Also, in S64, 2014, they acquired Brookfield's Core Fixed Income Insurance Business. That's asset management again. \n\nAnother one is S69, 2016, acquiring Octagon Credit Investors for CLOs, bank loans, and high yield bonds. That's part of asset management. \n\nThe outcomes would include enhanced software capabilities from DFA, expanded asset management services through the acquisitions, and entering new markets or product lines. \n\nI need to make sure each acquisition is cited correctly. For example, the DFA acquisition is S59, S60. The Goodwin Capital is S62, S63. Brookfield is S64, S65. Octagon is S69. \n\nAlso, check if there are other acquisitions in the 2000s. In 2000, MetLife acquisition, but that's a takeover, not an acquisition by Conning. The user is asking about acquisitions that enhanced their capabilities, so the ones they made, not the ones they were part of. \n\nSo the key ones are DFA in 2010, Goodwin in 2011, Brookfield in 2014, Octagon in 2016. Also, in the 2000s, maybe the 2003 spin-offs, but the question is about acquisitions. \n\nWait, in the 2000s, there's S43: Conning acquired Charter Oak Asset Management in 2000. But does that relate to risk modeling or asset management? It's an asset management company, so that's relevant. But the user might be looking for more specific ones. \n\nAlso, in S45, Swiss Re acquired Conning in 2001, but again, that's a takeover. The user wants acquisitions made by Conning. \n\nSo the main acquisitions are:\n\n- DFA Capital Management (2010): risk modeling software\n- Goodwin Capital Advisers (2011): fixed income asset management\n- Brookfield's Core Fixed Income Business (2014): asset management\n- Octagon Credit Investors (2016): CLOs, bank loans, high yield bonds\n\nOutcomes: Enhanced risk modeling capabilities via DFA's software, expanded asset management services, access to new investment strategies, and strengthened market position.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each acquisition, the year, the company, and the outcome, citing the relevant sentences."
