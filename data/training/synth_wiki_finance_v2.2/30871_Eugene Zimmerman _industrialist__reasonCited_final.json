The user is asking about Eugene Zimmerman's role in the acquisition and financial challenges of the P\u00e8re Marquette system and how that relates to his dealings with J.P.

Let me scan each sentence.\n\nStarting with [S31], it mentions that Zimmerman succeeded in gaining control of the P\u00e8re Marquette system. That's part of the acquisition. Then, in [S47], it says he was preparing to testify about the sale of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad and the P\u00e8re Marquette to J.P. Morgan & Co., and he made a profit of over $1 million. That connects him to J.P. Morgan. \n\nLooking at [S48], it references the testimony where J.P. Morgan had a loss when acquiring Zimmerman's Great Central system, which failed to sell to the Erie Railroad. Also, [S50] mentions Stevens testifying that Zimmerman and associates loaded $24 million in obligations on the railroad and took a 999-year lease on the P\u00e8re Marquette, guaranteeing bonds. This shows financial dealings and challenges. \n\nThe DT&I went bankrupt in 1908, leading to the sale of Ann Arbor to Zimmerman, who then sold it in 1909. But the P\u00e8re Marquette is mentioned in the context of the sale to J.P. Morgan. The financial challenges might be tied to the bankruptcy and the obligations mentioned. \n\nSo, putting it together: Zimmerman acquired the P\u00e8re Marquette, then sold it to J.P. Morgan, but there were financial issues with the acquisition, leading to Morgan's loss. The citations would be [S31], [S47], [S48], [S50]. Need to check if these sentences are correctly cited.

      "answer": "<statement>Zimmerman played a role in the financial affairs of his son-in-law, the Duke of Manchester, by paying off the Duke's debts in 1908.

[S69] ### Descendants\n\nThrough his daughter Helena, he was the grandfather of four, including Lady Mary Alice Montagu (1901\u20131962); Alexander Montagu, 10th Duke of Manchester (1902\u20131977); Lord Edward Eugene Fernando Montagu (1906\u20131954); and Lady Ellen Millicent Louise Montagu (1908\u20131948).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n# Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n\n**Eugene Zimmerman** (December 17, 1845 \u2013 December 20, 1914) was an American industrialist and railroad owner. [S2] He amassed great wealth as a stockholder or shareholder in John D. [S3] Rockefeller's Standard Oil. [S4] He used the income from his Standard Oil holdings to invest in railroads. [S5] ## Early life\n\nZimmerman was born in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, on December 17, 1845. [S6] He was son of Solomon Zimmerman (Kingston, Ross County, Ohio, 1807 \u2013 Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 13 May 1859) and wife (Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, 27 February 1845) Hannah J. [S7] Biggs (Pennsylvania, 1824 \u2013 Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 14 July 1861) and paternal grandson of Martin Zimmerman and wife Barbara Pontius. [S8] His younger brother was Martin Zimmerman and his younger sister was Ellen (n\u00e9e Zimmerman) Laird. [S9] After his father's death, his mother remarried to Andrew Jackson LaBoiteaux in November 1859 in Hamilton County, Ohio, before her death in 1861. [S10] His grandfather was an officer in the Dutch Army. [S11] His father had moved to Mississippi from Ohio to inherit a foundry and several slaves. [S12] Eugene grew up at the family's business and was sent to Cincinnati in 1859 to attend Farmer's College. [S13] In the spring of 1861, he began attending the preparatory school Gambier Academy with the intention of attending Kenyon College. [S14] ## Career\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War, Zimmerman left the academy and tried to join the Union Navy, but was refused because he was too young. [S15] After some modifications, he was accepted, becoming a Master's mate and was assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron. [S16] While in the Navy, his ship was struck by torpedo which killed several seamen and threw him into the Yazoo River. [S17] He participated in the Battle of Saint Charles and Duvall's Bluffs and served with distinction during the capture of Arkansas Post in 1863, after which he was promoted to Ensign. [S18] During the Vicksburg campaign in his hometown, Zimmerman was placed in charge of a mortar boat and sent up the Yazoo River, making a successful run against the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg in April 1863. [S19] During the campaign, he was involved in several missions and was promoted to acting Master and Officer of the side wheel steamer USS Ouachita after the surrender of Vicksburg which he held until the end of the War. [S20] During the siege, his former home and his father's business were destroyed. [S21] During the remainder of the war, he was eventually made a Lieutenant and a ship commander at the age of nineteen (the youngest officer at his rank in the entire U.S. [S22] Navy). [S23] After the War, he resigned his commission, was honorably discharged, and returned to Ohio. [S24] ### Business career\n\nAfter the war, he went into the oil business, acquiring extensive holdings which he sold to John D. [S25] Rockefeller in exchange for shares in Standard Oil where he became a substantial stockholder and gained seat on the company's board. [S26] In 1875, Zimmerman purchased more than 13,000 acres of timberland in what is now Yosemite in Casey County, Kentucky. [S27] He ran a lumber mill there and built a wooden train track from Kings Mountain to Staffordsville in 1884, later organizing the Green River Railway Co. [S28] He used his income to invest in railroads and was president of the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad, and the Kentucky and South Atlantic Railroad, which later became a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway after he sold it to Collis P. [S29] Huntington which led to a long partnership with Huntington, including looking after his interests in the Midwest. [S30] In 1882, he became president of the Chesapeake and Nashville Railway (and constructed the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge at Cincinnati for Huntington), and in 1888 he was elected president of Dayton, Forth Wayne and Chicago Railway.",

        "[S1] Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n# Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n\n**Eugene Zimmerman** (December 17, 1845 \u2013 December 20, 1914) was an American industrialist and railroad owner. [S2] He amassed great wealth as a stockholder or shareholder in John D. [S3] Rockefeller's Standard Oil. [S4] He used the income from his Standard Oil holdings to invest in railroads. [S5] ## Early life\n\nZimmerman was born in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, on December 17, 1845. [S6] He was son of Solomon Zimmerman (Kingston, Ross County, Ohio, 1807 \u2013 Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 13 May 1859) and wife (Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, 27 February 1845) Hannah J. [S7] Biggs (Pennsylvania, 1824 \u2013 Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 14 July 1861) and paternal grandson of Martin Zimmerman and wife Barbara Pontius. [S8] His younger brother was Martin Zimmerman and his younger sister was Ellen (n\u00e9e Zimmerman) Laird. [S9] After his father's death, his mother remarried to Andrew Jackson LaBoiteaux in November 1859 in Hamilton County, Ohio, before her death in 1861. [S10] His grandfather was an officer in the Dutch Army. [S11] His father had moved to Mississippi from Ohio to inherit a foundry and several slaves. [S12] Eugene grew up at the family's business and was sent to Cincinnati in 1859 to attend Farmer's College. [S13] In the spring of 1861, he began attending the preparatory school Gambier Academy with the intention of attending Kenyon College. [S14] ## Career\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War, Zimmerman left the academy and tried to join the Union Navy, but was refused because he was too young. [S15] After some modifications, he was accepted, becoming a Master's mate and was assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron. [S16] While in the Navy, his ship was struck by torpedo which killed several seamen and threw him into the Yazoo River. [S17] He participated in the Battle of Saint Charles and Duvall's Bluffs and served with distinction during the capture of Arkansas Post in 1863, after which he was promoted to Ensign. [S18] During the Vicksburg campaign in his hometown, Zimmerman was placed in charge of a mortar boat and sent up the Yazoo River, making a successful run against the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg in April 1863. [S19] During the campaign, he was involved in several missions and was promoted to acting Master and Officer of the side wheel steamer USS Ouachita after the surrender of Vicksburg which he held until the end of the War. [S20] During the siege, his former home and his father's business were destroyed. [S21] During the remainder of the war, he was eventually made a Lieutenant and a ship commander at the age of nineteen (the youngest officer at his rank in the entire U.S. [S22] Navy). [S23] After the War, he resigned his commission, was honorably discharged, and returned to Ohio. [S24] ### Business career\n\nAfter the war, he went into the oil business, acquiring extensive holdings which he sold to John D. [S25] Rockefeller in exchange for shares in Standard Oil where he became a substantial stockholder and gained seat on the company's board. [S26] In 1875, Zimmerman purchased more than 13,000 acres of timberland in what is now Yosemite in Casey County, Kentucky. [S27] He ran a lumber mill there and built a wooden train track from Kings Mountain to Staffordsville in 1884, later organizing the Green River Railway Co. [S28] He used his income to invest in railroads and was president of the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad, and the Kentucky and South Atlantic Railroad, which later became a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway after he sold it to Collis P. [S29] Huntington which led to a long partnership with Huntington, including looking after his interests in the Midwest. [S30] In 1882, he became president of the Chesapeake and Nashville Railway (and constructed the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge at Cincinnati for Huntington), and in 1888 he was elected president of Dayton, Forth Wayne and Chicago Railway."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role Zimmerman played in the financial affairs of his son-in-law, the Duke of Manchester, and how that intersected with his business ventures.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions several points. Let me scan through the sentences again. \n\nIn Passage 1, sentence S65 says that in 1908, Zimmerman paid off the Duke's debts but made them in the form of payments for the purchase of various Manchester estates, including Kimbolton Castle, Kylemore Castle, and Tandragee Castle, which were held for his grandson, Viscount Mandeville. That seems directly relevant. So Zimmerman financially supported the Duke by settling his debts, but instead of giving him money directly, he used it to buy estates for the grandson. \n\nAnother point is in S64, which states that from the beginning of his daughter's marriage, the Duke had financial difficulties and was a profligate gambler. So the Duke was already in trouble, and Zimmerman stepped in. Also, S66 mentions that by 1918, there were 66 bankruptcy petitions against the Duke. But how does this tie into Zimmerman's business ventures?\n\nLooking at the other parts of the context, like Passage 2, there's info about Zimmerman's business activities, like his involvement with Standard Oil, railroads, and other investments. However, the direct connection between his financial support of the Duke and his own business ventures isn't explicitly stated. The estates purchased for the grandson might be part of his business interests, but the context doesn't specify that. \n\nSo the main points are that Zimmerman paid off the Duke's debts by purchasing estates for his grandson. The intersection with his business ventures isn't clearly detailed beyond that. The answer should focus on the financial support and the method of settling debts through estate purchases. There's no mention of how this directly affected his business ventures, unless the estates were part of his investments. But the context doesn't explicitly state that. Therefore, the answer should be based on the given sentences."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Zimmerman's military service during the Civil War impacted his later career and what evidence from the source connects these experiences to his business acumen.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find mentions of his military service and then see if there's a link to his business career. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Career\" under which it mentions that upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Zimmerman left the academy to join the Union Navy but was too young. After some modifications, he was accepted as a Master's mate on the Mississippi River Squadron. His experiences include participating in battles, being promoted, and serving with distinction. After the war, he resigned and returned to Ohio. \n\nThen, in the \"Business career\" section, it says he went into the oil business, sold holdings to Rockefeller, became a stockholder, and later invested in railroads. The key here is to find if there's a direct connection between his military service and his business acumen. \n\nThe passage mentions that during the war, he was involved in missions, promoted to Lieutenant, and commanded a ship at a young age. These experiences might have given him leadership skills, strategic thinking, or organizational abilities that translated into his business ventures. However, the source doesn't explicitly state this connection. But the fact that he was able to rise quickly in the Navy and later manage large business ventures could imply that his military service contributed to his skills.\n\nLooking for specific citations, the military service is covered in S15 to S23. The business career starts at S24. The passage doesn't explicitly link the two, but the user is asking for evidence that connects them. Since the source doesn't have an explicit statement, maybe the implication is that his military experience provided him with the discipline and leadership necessary for his business successes. However, without an explicit citation, I can't cite specific sentences. But the user might expect that the fact that he was promoted and gained experience in the military is evidence of his capabilities, which then helped his business career. \n\nWait, the question is asking for evidence from the source that connects his military experiences to his business acumen. The source doesn't explicitly state this, but maybe the fact that he was able to lead and manage during the war and then later lead railroad companies is inferred. However, the user might expect that the answer should only use the citations provided. Since there's no direct statement, perhaps the answer is that the source doesn't explicitly state the impact, but the military service provided him with leadership experience which contributed to his business acumen. But according to the instructions, I need to use the supporting context. \n\nLooking again, the passage says he was promoted to Lieutenant at 19, commanded a ship, and after the war, he went into the oil business and became a stockholder. The connection is implied but not stated. Since the user wants citations, maybe the answer is that the source doesn't provide direct evidence, but the military service (S15-S23) and subsequent business roles (S24-S30) are mentioned, so the impact is inferred. However, the user might expect that the answer should only include what's in the text. \n\nIn the absence of explicit connections, the answer might be that the source doesn't provide direct evidence, but the military experience (S15-S23) and business career (S24-S30) are mentioned. However, the user might want the answer to note that while the source doesn't explicitly state the impact, the military service (citations) and business acumen (citations) are present. \n\nBut the user's question is about how the military service impacted his later career and what evidence connects them. Since the source doesn't explicitly state the impact, maybe the answer is that the source doesn't provide direct evidence, but the military service (S15-S23) and business career (S24-S30) are mentioned. However, the user might expect that the answer should be based on the given text. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that he was able to lead and manage during the war (S15-S23) and then later lead railroad companies (S24-S30) is considered evidence.

However, the exact connection isn't made in the text, so the answer should be cautious. But according to the instructions, I need to answer based on the supporting context. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that his military service (S15-S23) gave him leadership experience, which likely contributed to his business acumen (S24-S30), even if not explicitly stated. But since the user wants citations, I need to include the relevant sentences."

[S44] He continued to be a director of Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Western Railway, the Birmingham and Atlantic Railway and the North Alabama Coal and Iron Company. [S45] Henry Ford later bought DT&I in 1920.

[S47] Morgan & Co., for which Zimmerman made a profit of more than $1,000,000. [S48] Testimony given before the Commission told how J. [S49] Pierpont Morgan suffered a $12,00,000 loss when he acquired the Zimmerman's Great Central system, then failed to sell it to the Erie Railroad, and \"was forced to throw the system into the hands of a receiver.\" Frederick W. [S50] Stevens testified that Zimmerman and his associates loaded $24,000,000 worth of obligations on the railroad and took a 999-year lease on the P\u00e8re Marquette system and guaranteed the road's bonds. [S51] In his later years, he traveled through Europe and Africa. [S52] In 1901, he sailed aboard the Cunard *Umbria* with Miss B. [S53] Evans, his late wife's sister, for a month in Ireland with his daughter at Tandragee Castle in Northern Ireland. [S54] ## Personal life\n\nIn 1878, Zimmerman was married to Marietta A. [S55] \"Etta\" Evans (Urbana, Champaign County, Ohio, 1848 \u2013 23 December 1882), a daughter of Abraham Evans of West Liberty, and wife (Champaign County, Ohio, 17 March 1845) Elizabeth Igou, daughter of Peter Igou, farmer, and wife Susan McKenzie. [S56] Before her death in December 1882 from peritonitis, they were the parents of one child together: Helena Zimmerman (1878\u20131971), who married William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester in 1900. [S57] They divorced in 1931 and, in 1937, she married Arthur Keith-Falconer, 10th Earl of Kintore and remained married until his death in 1966."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Eugene Zimmerman's key business strategies and financial outcomes with the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway and the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railway, including J.P. Morgan & Co.'s role.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passage and pick out relevant sentences. Let me start by scanning the passage for mentions of Zimmerman's roles and the railways mentioned.\n\nLooking at the passage, S31 mentions he became president of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway in 1904, and he got the Queen and Crescent as a tributary and control of the P\u00e8re Marquette system and the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad. That's a key business strategy\u2014expanding control through acquisitions. Then S32 talks about George M. Cumming being elected vice president to represent New York capital. Maybe that's about securing financial backing, but not sure if that's Zimmerman's strategy directly.\n\nS36-38 mention Cumming being president of DT&I for a month, then Zimmerman taking over. S39 says DT&I took control of Ann Arbor Railroad from Rudolph Kleybolte & Co. in 1905. S41 adds that this acquisition connected Toledo with Frankfort, doubling the DT&I system. So that's another strategy of expanding through acquisitions. But then S42 says DT&I went bankrupt in 1908, leading to Zimmerman selling Ann Arbor in 1909. Financial outcome here is bankruptcy and subsequent sale.\n\nS47 mentions Zimmerman making a profit of over $1M from the sale to J.P. Morgan & Co. Also, S48 says he testified about the sale of Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton and P\u00e8re Marquette to J.P. Morgan. Then S49 mentions J.P. Morgan had a $12M loss when acquiring Zimmerman's Great Central system, which failed to sell to Erie Railroad. S51 states that Zimmerman and associates loaded $24M in obligations on the railroad and took a 999-year lease on P\u00e8re Marquette, guaranteeing bonds. That seems like a financial strategy, maybe leveraging debt.\n\nSo key strategies: acquiring other railroads (Queen and Crescent, P\u00e8re Marquette, Ann Arbor), expanding systems, and leveraging debt with leases and bond guarantees. Financial outcomes include profit from selling to J.P. Morgan, but also the bankruptcy of DT&I. J.P. Morgan's role was both as a buyer (for profit) and a buyer who later faced losses, and also in the testimony regarding the sale.\n\nI need to structure this into statements with citations. Each sentence should have its own citations. Let me check each part again to make sure I'm not missing anything. Also, the user wants the role of J.P. Morgan in the transactions. The passage mentions the sale to J.P. Morgan, Zimmerman's profit, and Morgan's loss with the Great Central system. Also, the testimony about obligations and leases.\n\nSo the answer should include:\n\n1. Zimmerman's strategies: expanding through acquisitions (Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton, P\u00e8re Marquette, Ann Arbor), taking leases, guaranteeing bonds.\n2. Financial outcomes: profit from sale to J.P. Morgan, DT&I bankruptcy, sale of Ann Arbor.\n3. J.P. Morgan's role: buying the railroads, facing losses, involvement in the sale and testimony.\n\nNow, I need to format each of these points into statements with the correct citations. Let me make sure each citation is correctly numbered as per the passage."

Then, in [S43], it says Zimmerman sold the line in 1909 to Joseph Ramsey, Jr. and Newman Erb, and retired from active business while keeping his coal and iron lands. \n\nSo the consequences of the bankruptcy include the divestiture of the Ann Arbor Railroad to Zimmerman and his subsequent sale of that line.

    "[S1] Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n# Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n\n**Eugene Zimmerman** (December 17, 1845 \u2013 December 20, 1914) was an American industrialist and railroad owner. [S2] He amassed great wealth as a stockholder or shareholder in John D. [S3] Rockefeller's Standard Oil. [S4] He used the income from his Standard Oil holdings to invest in railroads. [S5] ## Early life\n\nZimmerman was born in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, on December 17, 1845. [S6] He was son of Solomon Zimmerman (Kingston, Ross County, Ohio, 1807 \u2013 Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 13 May 1859) and wife (Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, 27 February 1845) Hannah J. [S7] Biggs (Pennsylvania, 1824 \u2013 Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 14 July 1861) and paternal grandson of Martin Zimmerman and wife Barbara Pontius. [S8] His younger brother was Martin Zimmerman and his younger sister was Ellen (n\u00e9e Zimmerman) Laird. [S9] After his father's death, his mother remarried to Andrew Jackson LaBoiteaux in November 1859 in Hamilton County, Ohio, before her death in 1861. [S10] His grandfather was an officer in the Dutch Army. [S11] His father had moved to Mississippi from Ohio to inherit a foundry and several slaves. [S12] Eugene grew up at the family's business and was sent to Cincinnati in 1859 to attend Farmer's College. [S13] In the spring of 1861, he began attending the preparatory school Gambier Academy with the intention of attending Kenyon College. [S14] ## Career\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War, Zimmerman left the academy and tried to join the Union Navy, but was refused because he was too young. [S15] After some modifications, he was accepted, becoming a Master's mate and was assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron. [S16] While in the Navy, his ship was struck by torpedo which killed several seamen and threw him into the Yazoo River. [S17] He participated in the Battle of Saint Charles and Duvall's Bluffs and served with distinction during the capture of Arkansas Post in 1863, after which he was promoted to Ensign. [S18] During the Vicksburg campaign in his hometown, Zimmerman was placed in charge of a mortar boat and sent up the Yazoo River, making a successful run against the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg in April 1863. [S19] During the campaign, he was involved in several missions and was promoted to acting Master and Officer of the side wheel steamer USS Ouachita after the surrender of Vicksburg which he held until the end of the War. [S20] During the siege, his former home and his father's business were destroyed. [S21] During the remainder of the war, he was eventually made a Lieutenant and a ship commander at the age of nineteen (the youngest officer at his rank in the entire U.S. [S22] Navy). [S23] After the War, he resigned his commission, was honorably discharged, and returned to Ohio. [S24] ### Business career\n\nAfter the war, he went into the oil business, acquiring extensive holdings which he sold to John D. [S25] Rockefeller in exchange for shares in Standard Oil where he became a substantial stockholder and gained seat on the company's board. [S26] In 1875, Zimmerman purchased more than 13,000 acres of timberland in what is now Yosemite in Casey County, Kentucky. [S27] He ran a lumber mill there and built a wooden train track from Kings Mountain to Staffordsville in 1884, later organizing the Green River Railway Co. [S28] He used his income to invest in railroads and was president of the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad, and the Kentucky and South Atlantic Railroad, which later became a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway after he sold it to Collis P. [S29] Huntington which led to a long partnership with Huntington, including looking after his interests in the Midwest. [S30] In 1882, he became president of the Chesapeake and Nashville Railway (and constructed the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge at Cincinnati for Huntington), and in 1888 he was elected president of Dayton, Forth Wayne and Chicago Railway.",
    "[S31] In 1904, he was made president of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway, and succeeded in getting the Queen and Crescent as its tributary and gaining control of the P\u00e8re Marquette system, and the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. [S32] Louis Railroad. [S33] George M. [S34] Cumming, a lawyer with the United States Mortgage and Trust Company of New York, was elected vice president to represent the interest of New York capital. [S35] In 1906, along with his son-in-law, he toured the route of the proposed Newry, Keady Tynan Railway in Ireland to see whether to build a railway there. [S36] In June 1905, Cumming was elected president of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad and served for one month; he was succeeded by F. [S37] A.

[S55] \"Etta\" Evans (Urbana, Champaign County, Ohio, 1848 \u2013 23 December 1882), a daughter of Abraham Evans of West Liberty, and wife (Champaign County, Ohio, 17 March 1845) Elizabeth Igou, daughter of Peter Igou, farmer, and wife Susan McKenzie. [S56] Before her death in December 1882 from peritonitis, they were the parents of one child together: Helena Zimmerman (1878\u20131971), who married William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester in 1900. [S57] They divorced in 1931 and, in 1937, she married Arthur Keith-Falconer, 10th Earl of Kintore and remained married until his death in 1966.",
    "[S58] Zimmerman lived at 2448 Auburn Avenue, the southeast corner of Auburn and McMillan in Mount Auburn, an affluent neighborhood in Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, and was a member of the Loyal Legion, the Lotos Club, the American Yacht Club, and the Queen City Club of Cincinnati. [S59] He died at the Queen City Club on December 20, 1914. [S60] A few minutes before his death, he had been laughing over a $100,000 breach of promise suit filed against him in New York by Icy Wareham the previous June. [S61] Reportedly, Wareham, a dog fancier from Elmhurst on Long Island, alleged Zimmerman promised to marry her on December 30, 1913, and she was ready to marry him still. [S62] After his daughter returned to Ohio from Europe, he was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati. [S63] He left an estate valued at $10,000,000 in trust. [S64] From the beginning of his daughter's marriage, the Duke had financial difficulties and was known as a profligate gambler who spent lavishly on other women. [S65] In 1908, Zimmerman paid off the Duke's debts but made them in the form of payments for the purchase of various Manchester estates (including Kimbolton Castle, Kylemore Castle and Tandragee Castle), which were held for his grandson, Viscount Mandeville. [S66] By 1918, sixty-six petitions of bankruptcy had been filed against his son-in-law in the English courts. [S67] After becoming estranged in 1914, the Duke and Duchess eventually divorced in 1931. [S68] His only child, the Dowager Countess of Kintore, died at Keith Hall in Inverurie on 15 December 1971 and was buried alongside her second husband at the Keith Hall Burial Ground in Inverurie. [S69] ### Descendants\n\nThrough his daughter Helena, he was the grandfather of four, including Lady Mary Alice Montagu (1901\u20131962); Alexander Montagu, 10th Duke of Manchester (1902\u20131977); Lord Edward Eugene Fernando Montagu (1906\u20131954); and Lady Ellen Millicent Louise Montagu (1908\u20131948)."
