The user is asking about the programs offered at SFU Beedie's different campuses and how they align with the school's historical development and international partnerships. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Let me start by identifying the programs at each campus. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, under the \"Campuses\" section, there's Burnaby, Surrey, and Downtown Vancouver (Segal Graduate School). \n\nBurnaby has the BBA undergraduate program. That's mentioned in S16. \n\nSurrey has the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program and the Part-Time MBA, according to S19. Also, S17 mentions the Surrey campus is a 30,000 sq m building. \n\nDowntown Vancouver's Segal Graduate School has graduate programs. S20 and S21 talk about the Segal Graduate School. Then, in Passage 2, S24 lists the graduate programs there: Executive MBA, MBA, Indigenous Business Leadership Executive MBA, Management of Technology MBA, Master of Science in Finance, Graduate Diploma in Business Administration, and PhD. \n\nAlso, in Passage 1, S4 mentions over 800 MBA and grad students in Segal Graduate School and SFU Surrey. So the MBA programs are at both Surrey and downtown Vancouver. \n\nNow, the historical development part. The school was founded in 1965, became a faculty in 1982 with BBA. In 2022, 40th anniversary. The EMBA was established in 1968 (S5), which was the first in Canada. Then in 2000, they launched several programs (S6). The 2011 programs include the Executive MBA for the Americas with partners in the US, Mexico, Brazil (S7). Also, the Indigenous MBA in 2011 (S8). \n\nInternational partnerships: The 2011 Executive MBA for the Americas with Vanderbilt, ITAM, and IMFB (S7). Also, the Jack Austin Centre (S24-27) is a joint venture with the Asia Pacific Foundation. \n\nCitations needed for each part. For the programs at each campus, cite S16 (Burnaby BBA), S19 (Surrey Entrepreneurship and Part-Time MBA), S24 (Downtown grad programs). For historical development, S2 (founded 1965), S3 (40th anniversary 2022), S5 (EMBA 1968), S6 (2000 programs), S7 (2011 international EMBA), S8 (Indigenous MBA 2011). For international partnerships, S7 and S24-27 (Jack Austin Centre). \n\nNeed to structure the answer with each statement and citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. Check if all info is covered and citations are accurate."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the $22 million donation from Ryan Beedie in 2011 impacted the school's programs and international initiatives. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the donation in sentence S9: \"In 2011, the school received a donation in the amount of $22 million from alumnus Ryan Beedie and his father Keith, establishing SFU's Beedie School of Business.\" So that's the direct mention of the donation.\n\nNow, the question is about the impact on programs and international initiatives. The next step is to see if there are any sentences that link this donation to specific changes or developments. \n\nLooking at the sentences after S9, there's S7 and S8 which talk about initiatives in 2011. S7 mentions the launch of the world's first Executive MBA for the Americas in partnership with universities in the US, Mexico, and Brazil. S8 mentions the Canada's first Indigenous Business Leadership Executive MBA. Both of these were launched in 2011, the same year as the donation. \n\nBut does the passage explicitly state that the donation funded these initiatives? The text doesn't directly connect the donation to these specific programs. It just states that the donation established the school. However, since the initiatives were launched in the same year, it's possible that the donation contributed to them. But without explicit wording, I can't assume that. \n\nThe user might be expecting that the donation led to these programs, but the supporting context doesn't make that connection. So I need to be careful not to infer beyond what's written. The only direct impact mentioned is the establishment of the school. However, the question is about programs and international initiatives. \n\nLooking again, maybe the donation allowed for the expansion or new programs. But since the passage doesn't explicitly state that, I can't cite S7 and S8 as being due to the donation. The answer should only include information that is directly supported by the context. \n\nTherefore, the only citation would be S9 for the donation itself. But the question is about the impact. If the passage doesn't mention the impact, then perhaps the answer is that the donation established the school, but there's no specific info on programs or international initiatives. However, the user might expect that the initiatives mentioned in S7 and S8 are related. \n\nBut since the passage doesn't explicitly say the donation caused those initiatives, I can't cite them. So the answer would be that the donation established the school, but there's no direct info on the impact on programs and initiatives. However, the user might want the answer to include the initiatives as part of the impact, even if not explicitly stated. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The instructions say to use the supporting context to answer as accurately as possible. If the context doesn't link the donation to the initiatives, then the answer should not include those citations. So the only citation is S9. But the user might think that the initiatives are part of the impact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the establishment of the school allowed for those programs. But again, the passage doesn't specify. So the safest answer is to cite S9 and mention that the donation established the school, but there's no direct info on the programs. However, the question is about the impact, so maybe the answer is that the donation led to the establishment, which might have enabled future programs, but that's speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, based on the given context, the only direct impact is the establishment of the school. The initiatives in 2011 (S7 and S8) are mentioned, but without explicit connection to the donation. Therefore, the answer should only cite S9."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the Jack Austin Centre in SFU Beedie's mission and how it relates to the school's focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. In Passage 1, there's a lot of information about SFU Beedie's history, programs, campuses, and partnerships. But the Jack Austin Centre is mentioned in Passage 2. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Jack Austin Centre for Asia-Pacific Business Studies.\" The relevant sentences are [S25] and [S26]. Sentence [S25] says the centre is a joint venture between SFU Beedie and the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, focusing on research, outreach, and training related to Canada's interests in the Asia Pacific region with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. Sentence [S26] mentions the centre was named after Jack Austin for his work in Asia-Canada relations.\n\nSo, the role of the Jack Austin Centre is to facilitate research, outreach, and training on business issues relevant to Canada's Asia-Pacific interests, specifically emphasizing innovation and entrepreneurship. The connection to SFU Beedie's mission would be through supporting these areas, which are part of the school's focus. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of the centre elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the passages, I don't see any other references. The citations would be [S25] and [S26]. \n\nNow, structuring the answer. The first part of the question is about the role, which is covered in [S25]. The second part about relating to innovation and entrepreneurship is also in [S25], as it mentions the focus on those areas. So both parts are in the same sentence. Therefore, the citations would be [S25][S26]. Wait, [S26] is about the naming, but the focus on innovation and entrepreneurship is in [S25]. Let me check again.\n\nYes, [S25] states the centre's focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. [S26] is about the naming. So the answer should cite [S25] for the role and the relation to innovation and entrepreneurship. But the user might need both sentences. Wait, the question is two parts: role in the mission and how it relates to the focus. The role is the joint venture providing research, etc., and the relation is the focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. So the first part of the answer is from [S25], and the second part is also from [S25]. So the citation is [S25]. But maybe [S26] is not needed here. Let me confirm.\n\nThe exact wording in [S25]: \"provide research, outreach and training activities on business issues that are relevant to Canada's interests in the Asia Pacific region with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\" So that sentence covers both the role (research, outreach, training) and the focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. Therefore, the citation is [S25]. The naming in [S26] isn't directly relevant to the role or the focus, so it's not needed here. \n\nSo the answer would be a statement citing [S25], explaining the role and the relation to innovation and entrepreneurship."

The accreditations (AACSB and EQUIS) are indicators of quality, as they set standards for business schools. Being ranked in the top ten by Maclean's suggests that the school is recognized as a leading institution in Canada. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. Let me check again. There's also [S24] which talks about graduate programs, but that's more about programs than accreditations. The rest of the sentences mention history, campuses, alumni, etc., which aren't directly relevant here. \n\nSo the key points are the accreditations and the Maclean's ranking. The answer should cite [S13] and [S14]. I need to structure the answer with statements that include these citations. Also, ensure each sentence is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer to have each sentence with its own citations. So I need to form two sentences: one about accreditation and another about the ranking, each with their respective citations. Let me check the exact wording. \n\nThe answer should be concise, stating the accreditations and the ranking, then explaining how they reflect standards and recognition. But since the user wants the answer to use the supporting context, I need to paraphrase the info from the context. \n\nSo the first statement would be about the accreditations, citing [S13], and the second about the ranking, citing [S14]. Then, maybe a third statement combining them to show how they reflect standards. But the example given in the response format has two statements. Let me check the example again. \n\nThe example has two sentences, each with their own citations. So maybe two statements: one for accreditation and one for ranking. But the question is asking for both accreditation and rankings. So perhaps two sentences. \n\nAlternatively, one sentence combining both. But the user's example shows separate sentences. Let me structure it as two statements. \n\nSo:\n\n<statement> SFU Beedie is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS). <cite>[S13]</cite></statement>\n<statement> It is ranked among the top ten business schools in Canada by Maclean's, reflecting its academic standards and recognition. <cite>[S14]</cite></statement>\n\nThat should cover both aspects. I need to make sure the citations are correctly placed. Also, check if there's any other info in the context that might be relevant. For example, the mention of the Indigenous Business Leadership Executive MBA in [S8] might relate to recognition, but the question is about accreditation and rankings. So probably not needed here. \n\nYes, I think that's all. The answer should be these two statements with the correct citations."
