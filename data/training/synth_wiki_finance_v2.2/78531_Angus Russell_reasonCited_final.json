The passage mentions Angus Russell as the CEO from 2008 to 2013. Then, in sentence S9, it says that on 30 April 2013, Flemming \u00d8rnskov of Bayer took over as CEO. That seems to answer both parts of the question. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any other information.

The date given is 30 April 2013. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other name mentioned. The supporting context only mentions Flemming \u00d8rnskov as the successor.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Angus Russell's tenure as CEO of Shire plc and the roles he held before becoming CEO.\n\nFirst, I need to find the duration of his CEO tenure. Looking at the passage, sentence S3 says he was the CEO from 2008 to 2013. Then, sentence S9 mentions that on 30 April 2013, Flemming \u00d8rnskov took over. So his tenure was from 2008 to 2013. The exact start date is given in S6 as 18 June 2008. But the question asks for the duration, so maybe just the years are needed unless the exact dates are required. The answer should probably state 2008 to 2013.\n\nNext, the roles before CEO. Sentence S6 mentions he was the chief financial officer from 1999 to 2008, and also principal accounting officer and executive vice president of global finance. Additionally, S8 says he worked at ICI, Zeneca, and AstraZeneca for 19 years, with a role as vice president of corporate finance at AstraZeneca. So the roles at Shire before CEO were CFO, principal accounting officer, and EVP of global finance. The prior roles at other companies are also mentioned but might not be necessary unless the question includes \"at the company\" which refers to Shire. The question says \"roles did he hold at the company before becoming CEO,\" so \"the company\" is Shire. Therefore, the answer should focus on his roles at Shire, not the previous companies. So the answer would be CFO, principal accounting officer, and executive vice president of global finance.\n\nNow, check the citations. For the tenure, S3 and S9. For the roles, S6 and S7. Wait, S6 says he was appointed CEO in 2008, and S7 says he was CFO from 1999-2008. So the roles before CEO at Shire are listed in S7. The sentence about prior companies (S8) might not be relevant here since the question is about roles at Shire. So the citations for the roles would be S6 and S7. The duration is S3 and S9.\n\nSo the answer should be structured with two sentences. The first stating the duration with citations [S3][S9], and the second stating the roles with [S6][S7]. Wait, S6 mentions the appointment date, but the roles are in S7. Let me check again.\n\nThe question is asking for the duration of his tenure as CEO. The answer is from 2008 to 2013. The sentences S3 and S9 both mention these dates. S3 says he was CEO from 2008 to 2013. S9 says he stepped down in 2013. So both are relevant. For the roles before CEO, S6 says he was appointed CEO in 2008, taking over from Emmens. Then S7 says he was CFO from 1999-2008, and other roles. So the roles at Shire before CEO are in S7. Therefore, the citations for the roles would be [S7]. But S6 also mentions that he was the CEO, but the roles before CEO are in S7. So the answer would be: \"He held the roles of chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, and executive vice president of global finance at Shire plc before becoming CEO.\" With citation [S7]. But wait, S6 says he was appointed CEO in 2008, taking over from Emmens. Does that sentence mention his previous roles? No, S6 is about his appointment. The previous roles are in S7. So the answer for the roles is S7. But maybe S6 and S7 together? Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe question is \"what roles did he hold at the company before becoming CEO?\" So the answer is the roles at Shire before CEO. S7 says he was CFO from 1999-2008, and principal accounting officer and EVP of global finance. So that's the info. So the citation is S7. But the sentence about his appointment (S6) might not be needed here. So the answer would have two sentences: one about the duration with [S3][S9], and another about the roles with [S7]. But the user's example has multiple citations in one sentence. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Angus Russell's tenure as CEO of Shire plc lasted from 2008 to 2013.<cite>[S3][S9]</cite></statement> <statement>Before becoming CEO, he held the roles of chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, and executive vice president of global finance at Shire plc.<cite>[S7]</cite></statement>\n\nWait, but S7 says \"He was the chief financial officer of Shire from 1999 to 2008, and its principal accounting officer and executive vice president of global finance.\" So that's all in one sentence. So the second statement would cite S7. That's correct. The user's example has two sentences with citations. So that's the structure."
