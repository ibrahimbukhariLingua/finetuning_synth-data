[S21] Jeremy Lent's assumptions also proved to have flaws; the acquisition cost per-customer was higher than expected because Internet users tended to ignore NextCard's online ads (which were also very costly), and the customers were people with little creditworthiness looking for a \"lender of last resort\".

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key factors that led to NextCard's financial collapse and how their initial business assumptions interacted with accounting and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Passage 1 talks about the lawsuits, the auditors' issues, the stock price drop, takeover by FDIC, and the liquidation. Passage 2 gives background on the company's founding, business plan, operations, and downfall.\n\nStarting with the key factors contributing to the collapse. From Passage 1, there's mention of insider trading lawsuits, auditors altering documents, the stock price plummeting, FDIC takeover, and the company being liquidated with huge liabilities. Also, fraud charges against executives. But I need to connect these to the business assumptions.\n\nIn Passage 2, the business assumptions were that online acquisition costs would be lower and that internet users were more affluent and better credit risks. However, the reality was that acquisition costs were higher because people ignored the ads, and the customers had poor creditworthiness. This led to higher bad debt losses than expected. The company didn't account for these losses properly, leading to accounting issues. The Comptroller of the Currency forced them to increase bad debt allowances, and they tried to blame fraud instead of their own miscalculations.\n\nSo the key factors are the flawed business assumptions (high acquisition costs, poor credit quality of customers), poor accounting practices (underestimating bad debts, misclassifying losses as fraud), and legal issues (lawsuits, fraud charges, auditor misconduct). The interaction between these factors is that the initial assumptions led to aggressive growth and underestimating risks, which when combined with accounting manipulations and legal troubles, caused the collapse.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with citations. Each statement should have the relevant sentence numbers. Let me check each part:\n\n1. Flawed business assumptions: S10, S11, S22. These talk about the assumptions and their failure.\n2. Accounting issues: S23 (understating bad debts), S24 (OCC forcing increase), S25 (blaming fraud).\n3. Legal issues: S30 (lawsuit), S31 (auditor issues), S38 (fraud charges), S39-S40 (settled suits).\n4. Interaction: The assumptions led to higher costs and bad debts, which the company tried to hide through accounting, leading to legal problems.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S27 and S28 mention misclassifying losses as fraud, which ties into accounting issues. Also, the stock price drop (S33) and FDIC takeover (S34) are results of these factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should list the key factors with their citations and explain how the assumptions interacted with accounting and legal issues."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the sequence of events after NextCard's stock price collapse and how the FDIC's involvement led to its liquidation. I need to go through the provided passages and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the supporting context. There are two passages. Passage 1 seems to have more details about the events after the stock price drop. Let me check each sentence in Passage 1.\n\nStarting with [S30], it mentions the class-action lawsuit and the auditors' issues. But the question is about the sequence after the stock price collapse. The stock price fell from $53.12 to $.14, which is mentioned in [S33]. Then in February 2002, the FDIC took over. So that's the first event after the collapse.\n\nNext, [S34] says the bank tried to find a buyer, negotiating with CompuCredit but no one bought. Then [S35] in July 2002, most accounts were closed. [S36] mentions selling a portfolio to Merrick Bank, which increased APRs and fees. Then [S37] states the liquidation in 2003 with liabilities and assets. Also, [S38] mentions fraud charges against executives, and [S39]-[S40] about the SEC dismissing charges and settlements.\n\nNow, the FDIC's role: [S33] says the FDIC took over in Feb 2002. The FDIC's involvement would be part of the takeover, leading to the attempts to sell the company, which failed, resulting in liquidation. The FDIC's involvement here is crucial as they took control, tried to find a buyer, and when that failed, the company was liquidated.\n\nI need to structure the sequence: stock price collapse -> FDIC takeover -> attempts to sell (CompuCredit) -> accounts closed -> sale of portfolio -> liquidation. Also, the FDIC's role in the takeover and subsequent actions leading to liquidation.\n\nCheck if all these points are covered in the citations. The FDIC's involvement is directly mentioned in [S33]. The subsequent steps are in [S34]-[S37]. The liquidation is in [S37]. The fraud charges and settlements are part of the aftermath but maybe not directly related to the FDIC's role in liquidation. However, the question asks how FDIC's involvement shaped the liquidation. So the FDIC taking over and trying to find a buyer, failing, leading to liquidation.\n\nSo the answer should list the sequence with the relevant citations. Each event should be a separate statement with citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>."

[S3] The issuing bank was known as **NextBank** and was fully owned by NextCard, Inc. [S4] NextCard, Inc. [S5] was started during the Internet boom of the late 1990s. [S6] Jeremy and Molly Lent, a married couple, founded the company in 1996 as Internet Access Financial Corporation, later changing the name to NextCard in 1997. [S7] During the early 1990s, Jeremy Lent had served as CFO for Providian Financial Corporation which had relied heavily on direct mail marketing methods \"to identify and recruit customers who made extensive use of credit cards\". [S8] Convinced that he could adapt this marketing strategy for the Internet, Lent left Providian to form NextCard. [S9] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n## Operations\n\nThe Lents' business plan was based on two assumptions:\n\n1. [S10] Since a key metric in the credit card industry is acquisition cost of a new customer, he felt that he could \"use the internet to undercut the average acquisition cost\" of its \"brick-and-mortar\" competitors and\n2. [S11] He believed his company would have \"significantly lower bad debt losses than conventional credit card issuers since marketing research had found that internet users were generally more affluent and, thus, better credit risks, than individuals drawn from the general population of consumers\". [S12] Because of these assumptions, NextCard, Inc. [S13] offered credit cards at interest rates lower than its competitors'. [S14] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nNextCard issued MasterCard and Visa cards under its own brand, and co-branded cards with MyPoints.com, PlanetOut.com, and Amazon.com. [S15] NextCard also issued secured credit cards. [S16] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 NextCard was a major online advertiser at the time, as they only accepted applications online. [S17] Its website was \"regularly named one of the top 50 financial websites by *Money* magazine and by 2000 attracted more online 'hits' than any other website in the financial services industry\". [S18] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nThe company set aggressive growth targets and went public in 1999. [S19] Following its initial public offering, the internet 'bubble' in the stock market had burst. [S20] This \"effectively shut off the access of NextCard and thousands of other struggling Internet companies to the debt and equity markets\" . [S21] Jeremy Lent's assumptions also proved to have flaws; the acquisition cost per-customer was higher than expected because Internet users tended to ignore NextCard's online ads (which were also very costly), and the customers were people with little creditworthiness looking for a \"lender of last resort\". [S22] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n## Downfall\n\nTo understate its credit losses NextCard refused to \"provide sufficient allowances each period for expected bad debts\" . [S23] The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reviewed the company's accounting records and operating policies and procedures and forced NextCard to \"significantly increase its allowance for bad debts\". [S24] In response to this, NextCard stated that its high bad debts were due to fraudulent schemes perpetrated by hackers and the like. [S25] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nOn October 31, 2001, it was announced that NextCard was under-capitalized and was then investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. [S26] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 The reason, as stated to employees, was that the company had been categorizing as \"fraud losses\" what should have been categorized as \"credit losses\"... [S27] meaning the company was trying to categorize as fraud some of the money lost due to issuing cards to people with very poor credit. [S28] The Amazon.com Visa issued by NextCard was subsequently issued by Chase following NextCard's demise. [S29] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the misclassification of bad debt losses in NextCard's regulatory scrutiny and how the company tried to deflect blame.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections: Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me scan through each part.\n\nIn Passage 2, under the \"Downfall\" section, there's a mention that NextCard refused to provide sufficient allowances for expected bad debts. That's probably related to the misclassification. Then, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reviewed their records and forced them to increase the allowance. So that's part of the regulatory scrutiny. \n\nNext, the passage says that NextCard attributed their high bad debts to fraudulent schemes by hackers. That seems like an attempt to deflect blame. The company was categorizing credit losses as fraud losses, which is a misclassification. The citation for that is [S25]. Also, [S27] and [S28] explain that they were trying to categorize money lost from poor credit as fraud. \n\nSo the misclassification led to regulatory actions by the OCC and FDIC. The company tried to deflect by blaming fraud. I need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The sentence about refusing to provide allowances is [S23], the OCC's action is [S24], and the deflection via fraud is [S25]. The explanation of categorizing as fraud is [S27] and [S28]. \n\nWait, the user also asked how the company attempted to deflect blame. The answer would be that they blamed fraudulent schemes. So the relevant sentences are [S25], [S27], and [S28]. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with citations in <cite>. Let me check the exact sentences again.\n\nThe first part: \"To understate its credit losses NextCard refused to 'provide sufficient allowances each period for expected bad debts'.\" That's [S23]. Then, the OCC forced them to increase allowances [S24]. Then, NextCard stated high bad debts were due to fraud [S25]. The explanation of categorizing as fraud is in [S27] and [S28]. \n\nSo the answer would have multiple statements. Let me make sure each part is correctly cited. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. The FDIC investigation is mentioned in [S26], but that's more about the reason for the investigation, which is the misclassification. \n\nSo the role of misclassification is that it led to regulatory scrutiny (OCC and FDIC) and the company tried to deflect by blaming fraud. The citations would be [S23][S24][S25][S27][S28]. \n\nI need to split this into separate statements. For example, the first statement about refusing to provide allowances, then the OCC's action, then the deflection via fraud, and the explanation of the categorization. Each with their respective citations."
