      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the positions Martin Jacomb held in the financial sector and how his views on university independence relate to his belief in private funding for academic freedom.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find the relevant information. Let me scan each sentence.\n\nStarting with the first part: positions in the financial sector. Sentence [S2] mentions he was a vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson Ltd from 1976 to 1985 and a deputy chairman of Barclays Bank between 1985 and 1993. That's two positions. Then, in [S1], he's noted as Chairman of Canary Wharf Group. Wait, [S1] says \"Chancellor of the University of Buckingham and Chairman of Canary Wharf Group.\" So that's another position. So three positions: Vice-chairman at Kleinwort Benson, Deputy chairman at Barclays, and Chairman at Canary Wharf Group. \n\nNext, the second part: his views on university independence and private funding. Looking through the sentences, [S9] states he believed universities need to be independent of government. [S10] says he argued that universities must be independent of government funding to nurture free research and be guardians of liberty. [S11] mentions he thought Oxford should become private to avoid government restrictions. [S12] adds that academics need independence from government funding to challenge opinions. [S13] notes he believed government funding had bad effects on European higher education. \n\nSo his views on university independence are tied to needing private funding to ensure academic freedom, as government funding leads to restrictions and authoritarian control. The citations for the positions would be [S1][S2], and for the views, [S9][S10][S11][S12][S13]. \n\nWait, the question asks how his views on university independence relate to his belief in private funding. The passage directly connects his belief in independence (from government) to the necessity of private funding. So the answer should link those points. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the relevant citations. For example, the positions would be in one sentence with [S1][S2], and the views in another with the relevant citations. Need to make sure each statement is properly cited."

    "[S1] Martin Jacomb\n\n\n# Martin Jacomb\n\n\n\n**Sir Martin Wakefield Jacomb** (11 November 1929 \u2013 8 June 2024) was a Chancellor of the University of Buckingham and Chairman of Canary Wharf Group. [S2] He was a vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson Ltd, from 1976 to 1985, and a deputy chairman of Barclays Bank between 1985 and 1993. [S3] ## Life and career\n\nJacomb was born on 11 November 1929, and was educated at Eton College and Worcester College, Oxford. [S4] He was called to the Bar at Inner Temple in 1955 and practised as a barrister until 1968 before embarking upon a successful career in business. [S5] In 1985, he was appointed Knight Bachelor by HM The Queen. [S6] In 1986, he described insider trading as a \"victimless crime.\"\n\nIn 1998, he was appointed the third Chancellor of the University of Buckingham in succession to Baroness Thatcher, who in turn succeeded Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone. [S7] He was installed in 1999. [S8] According to the University of Buckingham, which is one of the two British private universities, \"He [Jacomb] is a strong believer in the need for universities to be independent of the government\". [S9] He has written that if universities are \"to nurture genuinely free and creative academic research\" and \"be the guardians of liberty which a free society needs\" they must be independent of government funding. [S10] Jacomb wrote that the University of Oxford should become private in order to avoid an authoritarian government imposing restrictions on admissions. [S11] Further, the university's academics will only be able to challenge prevailing opinion if they are independent of government funding. [S12] Dependence on government funding, he argued, has had disastrous effects on the higher education sector in continental Europe. [S13] Jacomb retired from the chancellorship in March 2010. [S14] He was succeeded by Lord Tanlaw.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nJacomb died on 8 June 2024, at the age of 94.
