[S2] For a brief time in 1939 and again in 1993, it was also the currency of both the separate Czech Republic and Slovakia. [S3] On 8 February 1993, it was replaced by the Czech koruna and the Slovak koruna, both at par. [S4] The (last) ISO 4217 code and the local abbreviations for the koruna were *CSK* and *K\u010ds*. [S5] One koruna equalled 100 *hal\u00e9\u0159\u016f* (Czech, singular: *hal\u00e9\u0159*) or *halierov* (Slovak, singular: *halier*). [S6] In both languages, the abbreviation *h* was used. [S7] The abbreviation was placed behind the numeric value. [S8] ## First koruna\n\nA currency called the *krone* in German and *koruna* in Czech was introduced in Austria-Hungary on 11 September 1892, as the first modern gold-based currency in the area. [S9] After the creation of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, an urgent need emerged for the establishment of a new currency system that would distinguish itself from the currencies of the other newly born countries suffering from inflation. [S10] The next year, on 10 April 1919, a currency reform took place, defining the new *koruna* as equal in value to the Austro-Hungarian krone. [S11] The first banknotes came into circulation the same year, the coins three years later, in 1922. [S12] This first koruna circulated until 1939, when separate currencies for Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia were introduced, at par with the Czechoslovak koruna. [S13] These were the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna. [S14] ### Coins\n\n\n### Banknotes\n\n\n## Second koruna\n\nThe Czechoslovak koruna was re-established in 1945, replacing the two previous currencies at par.

[S23] They decided to declare a currency reform effective from 1 June 1953 and to distribute new banknotes printed in the Soviet Union. [S24] The reform had been prepared very quickly and was confidential up to the last minute, but some information leaked anyway, causing a lot of panic. [S25] The night before the deadline, the president of Czechoslovakia, Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, made a radio speech, in which he lied to the nation that there was no possibility of a reform and quietened down the inhabitants. [S26] The next day, people (those lucky enough not to fit into the category of \"capitalistic elements\", a pejorative category which the intelligence agency used to blacklist certain individuals) were allowed to change up to 1,500 old korunas for new korunas at the rate of 5 old to 1 new koruna and the rest at the rate of 50 to 1.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of the 1953 currency reform in Czechoslovakia on the population and the role of the president's radio speech in mitigating public reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage mentions the 1953 reform in several sentences. Let me scan through the sentences to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at the passage, sentence S22 states that a drastic reform was undertaken in 1953. Then, S23 explains the context of the double market. The reform was announced to take effect on 1 June 1953, and new banknotes were printed in the Soviet Union (S24). The reform was kept secret until the last minute, leading to panic (S25). \n\nThen, there's S26 about the president, Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, making a radio speech where he lied about the reform not happening, which calmed people down. The next day, people could exchange old korunas for new ones, but the exchange rates were harsh: 5:1 for up to 1,500 old korunas and 50:1 for the rest (S27). Also, S28 mentions that insurance stock, state obligations, and commercial papers were nullified, leading to worse economic situations for many. \n\nThe impact on the population is mentioned in S28, stating that many people's economic situations worsened, leading to petitions and demonstrations, including the large one in Plze\u0148 where 472 were arrested (S28). \n\nSo, the president's speech (S26) played a role in mitigating immediate panic by lying about the reform, but the actual implementation had negative effects. The citations needed would be S22, S23, S24, S25, S26, S27, S28. \n\nWait, the question asks for the impact on the population and the role of the speech. The impact includes economic worsening and protests. The speech's role was to calm people down initially, but the reform's effects were negative. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Each sentence in the answer should have its citations. Let me check each part:\n\n1. The 1953 reform involved a double market and quick preparation (S22, S23, S24, S25).\n2. The president's speech (S26) lied about the reform to calm people.\n3. The exchange rates and nullification of assets (S27, S28) led to economic issues and protests.\n\nSo, the answer should have statements citing these sentences. Make sure each statement is a separate <statement> with appropriate citations."
