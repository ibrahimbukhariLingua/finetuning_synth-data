[S3] In 2017, Mercedes-Benz Group invested in Momenta, which was the automaker's first-ever investment into a Chinese startup. [S4] Momenta became the first Chinese unicorn in the field of self-driving cars after investors valued the company at more than $1 billion in 2021. [S5] The investors included, in addition to those already mentioned, General Motors (GM), IDG Capital, GGV Capital, Blue Lake Capital, Shunwei Capital, and Cathay Capital. [S6] General Motors invested $300 million in Momenta, as was announced in 2021, with the aim to accelerate the development of self-driving cars in China. [S7] By that time, Momenta struck partnerships with SAIC Motor, Toyota, auto parts supplier Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Temasek, Yunfeng Capital, and Tencent. [S8] Since 2021, SAIC Motors and Momenta have worked together on robotaxi operations in Shanghai and Suzhou. [S9] In addition, Momenta is also supplying autonomous driving technology to SAIC's IM. [S10] In December 2021, Momenta and BYD established a joint venture, called DiPi Intelligent Mobility Co, located in Shenzhen, to deploy autonomous driving capabilities across certain BYD car model lines. [S11] In 2023, General Motors China received approval to conduct road tests in Shanghai for its autonomous vehicles developed in collaboration with Momenta. [S12] In 2024, additional partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm followed. [S13] In August 2024, Audi and SAIC Motor announced a joint venture in which Momenta is contributing a system for autonomous driving.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about General Motors' role in Momenta's development and the key milestones in their collaboration. First, I need to go through the provided passage and pick out all the relevant information related to GM and Momenta's partnership.\n\nStarting with the passage, I'll scan each sentence. Sentence S3 mentions Mercedes-Benz investing in Momenta, but that's not GM. Then S5 lists investors including GM, so that's a point. S6 specifically states that GM invested $300 million in 2021 to accelerate self-driving car development in China. That's a key milestone. \n\nLooking further, S11 talks about a joint venture with BYD, but that's not GM. Then S12 mentions GM China getting approval for road tests in Shanghai with Momenta in 2023. That's another milestone. Are there others? Let me check again. S7 mentions partnerships including GM, but it's more about the partnerships rather than specific milestones. \n\nSo the main points are the $300 million investment in 2021 (S6) and the road test approval in 2023 (S12). Also, S5 mentions GM as an investor, but the specific role is covered in S6. The key milestones would be the investment and the road tests. I need to make sure there are no other sentences. S13 mentions partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm, not GM. So the answer should highlight GM's investment and the road test approval. Now, structuring the statements with citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the strategic collaborations Momenta established in 2024 and the purpose of those partnerships. First, I need to go through the supporting context provided and find any mentions of 2024.\n\nLooking at the passage, I see a few sentences. Let me scan through each one. \n\nStarting from the beginning, S1 introduces Momenta, S2 talks about the history, S3 mentions Mercedes-Benz investment in 2017. Then S12 says in 2023, GM China got approval for road tests. Then S13 states that in 2024, additional partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm followed. That's one collaboration. \n\nThen S14 mentions August 2024, Audi and SAIC Motor announced a joint venture where Momenta contributes autonomous driving systems. So that's another partnership. \n\nThe question is about 2024, so S13 and S14 are the key points here. The purpose of these partnerships would be related to autonomous driving, as per the context. For example, the joint venture with Audi and SAIC in S14 is about contributing a system for autonomous driving. The partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm in S13 would likely be for enhancing their autonomous driving technologies, though the exact purpose isn't specified beyond the collaborations themselves. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. The rest of the sentences either talk about earlier years or other details. So the answer should include the partnerships with Nvidia, Qualcomm, and the Audi-SAIC joint venture. The purposes would be related to autonomous driving, as per the context. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with the statements and citations. Each sentence should be in <statement> tags with the appropriate citations. The user wants each sentence to have its own citations. So the first statement about Nvidia and Qualcomm would cite S13, and the second about Audi and SAIC would cite S14. \n\nI need to check if there's any other info. The user might also want the purpose, so maybe the purpose is mentioned in the context. For example, the joint venture with Audi and SAIC is to deploy autonomous driving systems. The partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm might be for developing autonomous driving tech, but since the context doesn't specify, maybe just state the collaborations and note the purpose as per the given info. \n\nSo the answer would be two statements: one about the 2024 partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm (S13), and another about the Audi-SAIC joint venture (S14). The purposes would be inferred from the context, like advancing autonomous driving technologies."
