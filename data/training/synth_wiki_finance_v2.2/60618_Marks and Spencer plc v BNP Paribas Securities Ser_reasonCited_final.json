[S2] ## Facts\n\nMarks & Spencer, which was subleasing \u2018The Point\u2019 in Paddington Basin, W2 from BNP Paribas, claimed there should be an implied right to recover money that it had paid under its lease when it exercised the right to terminate. [S3] The basic rent was \u00a31.23m a year, plus a premium of \u00a3919,800 plus VAT, service charge, and a car park licence fee. [S4] The rent had to be paid by the quarter. [S5] The landlord could recover by rent a \u2018fair proportion\u2019 of building insurance costs and building service charges. [S6] Clause 8 allowed M&S to end the lease on 24 January 2012 with 6 months advance notice if there were no arrears in rent, and this meant the rent needed to be paid up to the end of the quarter, which was longer than the time M&S occupied the property. [S7] M&S did so, and then claimed it should get back the rent from 25 January to 24 March 2012. [S8] The default law on apportionability would have suggested the rent could not be recovered, under the Apportionment Act 1870, but it was argued that it was an implication of the contract that it should be. [S9] ## Judgment\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the term in the lease to recover the extra portion of the rent should not be implied.

[S15] Sir Thomas then explained that it was \"difficult to infer with confidence what the parties must have intended when they have entered into a lengthy and carefully-drafted contract but have omitted to make provision for the matter in issue\", because \"it may well be doubtful whether the omission was the result of the parties' oversight or of their deliberate decision\", or indeed the parties might suspect that \"they are unlikely to agree on what is to happen in a certain ... [S16] eventuality\" and \"may well choose to leave the matter uncovered in their contract in the hope that the eventuality will not occur\". [S17] Sir Thomas went on to say this at p 482:\n> \n> > \"The question of whether a term should be implied, and if so what, almost inevitably arises after a crisis has been reached in the performance of the contract.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the criteria the court used for implying terms in a contract and how these criteria interacted with the iterative process of contractual interpretation mentioned in the case.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several key points. In Passage 1, there's a reference to the Belize case and Lord Hoffmann's approach. Then, in Passage 2, there's a detailed discussion of the criteria for implying terms. \n\nLooking at the sentences, [S13] and [S14] in Passage 2 discuss Lord Simon's conditions for implying terms. The criteria listed are: (1) reasonable and equitable, (2) necessary for business efficacy, (3) obvious, (4) capable of clear expression, and (5) not contradicting express terms. These are the criteria the court referenced.\n\nNext, the interaction with the iterative process. In Passage 1, sentence [S129] mentions that the case illustrates an \"iterative\" process rather than a sequential one. The iterative process involves considering different interpretative techniques and comparing results based on language and business context to reflect the parties' intentions. The criteria from the Belize case (like business efficacy and reasonableness) would guide this iterative process, ensuring that the implied terms are both necessary and align with the contract's overall purpose.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The criteria are in [S13] and [S14], and the iterative process is mentioned in [S129]. Also, [S130] references the iterative process paper by Lord Grabiner. However, the question is about how the criteria interact with the iterative process. The answer should connect the criteria to the iterative approach, explaining that the criteria inform the iterative evaluation of terms.\n\nSo, the first statement would cite the criteria from [S13] and [S14], and the second statement would cite [S129] and [S130] for the iterative process. The interaction is explained by how the criteria are applied during the iterative analysis."

      "question": "How did the court address the distinction between interpretation and implication in contractual disputes, and what role did the *Belize* case play in this analysis?",
      "answer": "<statement>The court addressed the distinction between interpretation and implication in contractual disputes by rejecting a strict separation, instead viewing them as interconnected processes. It emphasized that implied terms are part of the broader exercise of interpreting the contract\u2019s meaning, rather than a distinct step.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the court addressed the distinction between interpretation and implication in contractual disputes and the role of the Belize case. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages. The main context is from Passage 1, which mentions the Belize case multiple times. In sentence S118, the court refers to the Belize case as the most modern treatment. Then, in S123, it talks about the distinction between interpretation and implication, noting that the Belize case wasn't referenced. \n\nLooking at S123 to S131, there's a discussion that the Belize case didn't support a sharp distinction between interpretation and implication. Instead, they were seen as part of a single exercise. The court mentions that Lord Hope considered the implied term as the product of interpretation. Also, there's a reference to an iterative process rather than a sequential one. \n\nIn S132, the court says Lord Neuberger's approach is consistent with Belize. The Belize case's approach is tied to the \"reasonable addressee\" concept. \n\nSo, the court seems to have blurred the lines between interpretation and implication, viewing them as interconnected. The Belize case provided a framework where implication is part of the interpretation process, emphasizing business efficacy and the reasonable addressee. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The relevant sentences are S118, S123, S124, S127, S128, S129, S132, S133. Wait, the user's question also mentions the role of Belize. So, the Belize case's role was to provide a modern approach that integrates implication into interpretation, rejecting a strict sequential approach. \n\nI should structure the answer with statements citing these sentences. For example, the first part about the court addressing the distinction would cite S123, S127, S128, S129. The role of Belize would cite S118, S132, S133.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S20] [He then quoted the observations of Scrutton LJ in Reigate, and continued] [I]t is not enough to show that had the parties foreseen the eventuality which in fact occurred they would have wished to make provision for it, unless it can also be shown either that there was only one contractual solution or that one of several possible solutions would without doubt have been preferred ...\"\n> \n> 20. [S21] Sir Thomas's approach in Philips was consistent with his reasoning, as Bingham LJ in the earlier case The APJ Priti [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 37, 42, where he rejected the argument that a warranty, to the effect that the port declared was prospectively safe, could be implied into a voyage charter-party. [S22] His reasons for rejecting the implication were \"because the omission of an express warranty may well have been deliberate, because such an implied term is not necessary for the business efficacy of the charter and because such an implied term would at best lie uneasily beside the express terms of the charter\". [S23] > \n> 21. [S24] In my judgment, the judicial observations so far considered represent a clear, consistent and principled approach. [S25] It could be dangerous to reformulate the principles, but I would add six comments on the summary given by Lord Simon in BP Refinery as extended by Sir Thomas Bingham in Philips and exemplified in The APJ Priti. [S26] First, in *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* [2002] 1 AC 408, 459, Lord Steyn rightly observed that the implication of a term was \"not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties\" when negotiating the contract. [S27] If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting. [S28] Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. [S29] Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. [S30] However, and thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon's first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable. [S31] Fourthly, as Lord Hoffmann I think suggested in *Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd* [2009] 1 WLR 1988, para 27, although Lord Simon's requirements are otherwise cumulative, I would accept that business necessity and obviousness, his second and third requirements, can be alternatives in the sense that only one of them needs to be satisfied, although I suspect that in practice it would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied. [S32] Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is \"vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care\", to quote from Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts 5th ed (2011), para 6.09. [S33] Sixthly, necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment. [S34] It is rightly common ground on this appeal that the test is not one of \"absolute necessity\", not least because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. [S35] It may well be that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon's second requirement is, as suggested by Lord Sumption in argument, that a term can only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence. [S36] > \n> 22. [S37] Before leaving this issue of general principle, it is appropriate to refer a little further to *Belize Telecom*, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the process of implying terms into a contract was part of the exercise of the construction, or interpretation, of the contract.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S83] It is true that *Belize Telecom* was a unanimous decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that the judgment was given by Lord Hoffmann, whose contributions in so many areas of law have been outstanding. [S84] However, it is apparent that Lord Hoffmann's observations in *Belize Telecom*, paras 17-27 are open to more than one interpretation on the two points identified in paras 23-24 and 25-30 above, and that some of those interpretations are wrong in law. [S85] In those circumstances, the right course for us to take is to say that those observations should henceforth be treated as a characteristically inspired discussion rather than authoritative guidance on the law of implied terms. [S86] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 43. [S87] It has long been well established that rent, whether payable in arrear or advance, is not apportionable in time in common law. [S88] Accordingly, if a lease under which the rent is payable in arrear was forfeited or came to an end prematurely for some other reason, the landlord loses the right to recover the rent due on the rent day following that determination, at least according to the common law - see eg *William Clun's Case* (1613) 10 Co Rep 127a . [S89] Parliament sought to remedy this initially in a limited way through the now repealed section 15 of the Distress for Rent Act 1737 and the Apportionment Act 1834, and then more comprehensively through the Apportionment Act 1870, which is still in force. [S90] Section 2 of the 1870 Act prospectively provides that \"All rents, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in the nature of income\" should \"like interest on money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day, and shall be apportionable in respect of time accordingly\". [S91] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 46. [S92] It follows from this conclusion that neither the common law nor statute apportions rent in advance on a time basis. [S93] And this was, correctly, generally understood to be the position when the Deed and the Lease were negotiated and executed. [S94] The claimant's argument, by contrast, is that a term should be implied into the Lease that the Basic Rent payable in advance on 25 December 2011 should effectively be apportioned on a time basis. [S95] The fact that the Lease was negotiated against the background of a clear, general (and correct) understanding that rent payable in advance was not apportionable in time, raises a real problem for the argument that a term can be implied into the Lease that it should be effectively apportionable if the Lease is prematurely determined in accordance with its terms. [S96] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 49. [S97] If one concentrates on the factors identified in paras 33-35 above, there appears to be a strong case for the implied term for which Mr Fetherstonhaugh QC powerfully argued on behalf of the claimant. [S98] The point made in para 33 supports the contention that, not merely would an implied term be fair, but that clause 8 could be said to work rather unfairly without the implied term. [S99] The point made in para 35, supported by what is said in para 34, provides real support for the proposition that, without the implied term, clause 8 would operate in a rather capricious way. [S100] On the other hand, as Mr Dowding QC rightly said on behalf of the defendants, the factors identified in paras 38-40 above chime with the warnings given by Sir Thomas Bingham in *Philips* and his reasons for rejecting an implied warranty in *APJ Priti*. [S101] The Lease is a very full and carefully considered contract, which includes express obligations of the same nature as the proposed implied term, namely financial liabilities in connection with the tenant's right to break, and that term would lie somewhat uneasily with some of those provisions. [S102] > \n> 50.

[S21] Sir Thomas's approach in Philips was consistent with his reasoning, as Bingham LJ in the earlier case The APJ Priti [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 37, 42, where he rejected the argument that a warranty, to the effect that the port declared was prospectively safe, could be implied into a voyage charter-party. [S22] His reasons for rejecting the implication were \"because the omission of an express warranty may well have been deliberate, because such an implied term is not necessary for the business efficacy of the charter and because such an implied term would at best lie uneasily beside the express terms of the charter\". [S23] > \n> 21. [S24] In my judgment, the judicial observations so far considered represent a clear, consistent and principled approach. [S25] It could be dangerous to reformulate the principles, but I would add six comments on the summary given by Lord Simon in BP Refinery as extended by Sir Thomas Bingham in Philips and exemplified in The APJ Priti. [S26] First, in *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* [2002] 1 AC 408, 459, Lord Steyn rightly observed that the implication of a term was \"not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties\" when negotiating the contract. [S27] If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting. [S28] Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. [S29] Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. [S30] However, and thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon's first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable. [S31] Fourthly, as Lord Hoffmann I think suggested in *Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd* [2009] 1 WLR 1988, para 27, although Lord Simon's requirements are otherwise cumulative, I would accept that business necessity and obviousness, his second and third requirements, can be alternatives in the sense that only one of them needs to be satisfied, although I suspect that in practice it would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied. [S32] Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is \"vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care\", to quote from Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts 5th ed (2011), para 6.09. [S33] Sixthly, necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment. [S34] It is rightly common ground on this appeal that the test is not one of \"absolute necessity\", not least because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. [S35] It may well be that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon's second requirement is, as suggested by Lord Sumption in argument, that a term can only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence. [S36] > \n> 22. [S37] Before leaving this issue of general principle, it is appropriate to refer a little further to *Belize Telecom*, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the process of implying terms into a contract was part of the exercise of the construction, or interpretation, of the contract.",
        "[S83] It is true that *Belize Telecom* was a unanimous decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that the judgment was given by Lord Hoffmann, whose contributions in so many areas of law have been outstanding. [S84] However, it is apparent that Lord Hoffmann's observations in *Belize Telecom*, paras 17-27 are open to more than one interpretation on the two points identified in paras 23-24 and 25-30 above, and that some of those interpretations are wrong in law.

[S86] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 43. [S87] It has long been well established that rent, whether payable in arrear or advance, is not apportionable in time in common law. [S88] Accordingly, if a lease under which the rent is payable in arrear was forfeited or came to an end prematurely for some other reason, the landlord loses the right to recover the rent due on the rent day following that determination, at least according to the common law - see eg *William Clun's Case* (1613) 10 Co Rep 127a . [S89] Parliament sought to remedy this initially in a limited way through the now repealed section 15 of the Distress for Rent Act 1737 and the Apportionment Act 1834, and then more comprehensively through the Apportionment Act 1870, which is still in force. [S90] Section 2 of the 1870 Act prospectively provides that \"All rents, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in the nature of income\" should \"like interest on money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day, and shall be apportionable in respect of time accordingly\". [S91] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 46. [S92] It follows from this conclusion that neither the common law nor statute apportions rent in advance on a time basis. [S93] And this was, correctly, generally understood to be the position when the Deed and the Lease were negotiated and executed. [S94] The claimant's argument, by contrast, is that a term should be implied into the Lease that the Basic Rent payable in advance on 25 December 2011 should effectively be apportioned on a time basis. [S95] The fact that the Lease was negotiated against the background of a clear, general (and correct) understanding that rent payable in advance was not apportionable in time, raises a real problem for the argument that a term can be implied into the Lease that it should be effectively apportionable if the Lease is prematurely determined in accordance with its terms.

[S97] If one concentrates on the factors identified in paras 33-35 above, there appears to be a strong case for the implied term for which Mr Fetherstonhaugh QC powerfully argued on behalf of the claimant. [S98] The point made in para 33 supports the contention that, not merely would an implied term be fair, but that clause 8 could be said to work rather unfairly without the implied term. [S99] The point made in para 35, supported by what is said in para 34, provides real support for the proposition that, without the implied term, clause 8 would operate in a rather capricious way. [S100] On the other hand, as Mr Dowding QC rightly said on behalf of the defendants, the factors identified in paras 38-40 above chime with the warnings given by Sir Thomas Bingham in *Philips* and his reasons for rejecting an implied warranty in *APJ Priti*. [S101] The Lease is a very full and carefully considered contract, which includes express obligations of the same nature as the proposed implied term, namely financial liabilities in connection with the tenant's right to break, and that term would lie somewhat uneasily with some of those provisions.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the principles that govern the implication of terms into a contract according to judicial observations in the passages, and how the rejection of *Belize Telecom*'s guidance affects this process.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passages mention several cases and judicial opinions. Let me start by identifying the key principles from the text.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a lot about the principles from cases like Reigate, Philips, The APJ Priti, and others. The user mentioned *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* and *Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd*. From the text, the principles include things like the term not being critically dependent on actual intention of the parties, but rather on what reasonable people would agree. Also, terms shouldn't be implied just because they seem fair or if the parties would have agreed if suggested. There's mention of business necessity and obviousness, and the officious bystander test. The idea that a term can be implied if the contract would lack commercial coherence without it.\n\nThen, in Passage 2, there's a discussion about *Belize Telecom*. The text says that the observations in *Belize Telecom* are not authoritative guidance anymore. Specifically, the passage states that the observations should be treated as a discussion rather than authoritative. This rejection affects the process by moving away from relying on *Belize Telecom*'s approach, which might have suggested a different method for implying terms. The judicial approach now seems to stick more to the principles from earlier cases like Philips and APJ Priti, emphasizing business efficacy and the officious bystander test.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer. The first part is the principles. The second part is how rejecting *Belize Telecom* affects the process.\n\nLooking at the citations: The principles are mentioned in S26-S36, S31, S32, S33, S34, S35, S36. The rejection of *Belize Telecom* is in S84, S85, S86. Also, S22 and S23 from Passage 1 talk about the rejection of a warranty in APJ Priti, which relates to the principles.\n\nWait, the user's question is about the principles according to judicial observations. So the answer should list the principles from the passages. Then, the effect of rejecting *Belize Telecom*.\n\nSo, the first statement would outline the principles. For example, the principles include that terms are not based on actual intention but on reasonable people's view, not just fairness, business necessity, and the officious bystander test. Then, the rejection of *Belize Telecom* means that their guidance isn't followed, so the focus is on earlier principles.\n\nI need to make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Let me check each part.\n\nFor the principles: \n\n- \"the implication of a term was not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties\" [S26]\n- \"a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair\" [S28]\n- \"business necessity and obviousness... can be alternatives\" [S31]\n- \"officious bystander... formulate the question with utmost care\" [S32]\n- \"necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment\" [S33]\n- \"term can only be implied if... contract would lack commercial or practical coherence\" [S35]\n\nThen, the rejection of *Belize Telecom* is in S84, S85, S86. The passage says that the observations in *Belize Telecom* are not authoritative, so the process now relies on other principles.\n\nSo the answer would have statements citing these sentences. Need to make sure each statement is a separate <statement> with the correct citations."

Precedent supporting this tension includes *The APJ Priti* case, where Bingham LJ rejected an implied warranty in a voyage charter-party, stating that such terms would \"lie uneasily beside the express terms of the charter.\" This reflects a judicial principle that implied terms must align with the contract's express language and not contradict it, especially in detailed agreements.<cite>[S22][S21]</cite></statement><statement>In the lease dispute context, the conflict is further illustrated by the argument that a term implying rent apportionment would clash with the lease's express provisions and the parties' shared understanding that rent payable in advance was not apportionable.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the conflict between implied terms and express contractual provisions arises in the lease dispute context and what precedent supports this tension.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several cases and legal principles. Let me scan through the sentences to find relevant parts.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a reference to the case The APJ Priti [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 37, where Bingham LJ rejected an implied warranty in a voyage charter-party. The reasons given were that the omission was deliberate, the term wasn't necessary for business efficacy, and it would conflict with express terms. That seems like a key point about the conflict between implied and express terms.\n\nAnother part mentions Sir Thomas Bingham's approach in Philips, which aligns with The APJ Priti case. The passage also discusses the test for implying terms, like business efficacy and the officious bystander test. There's a mention of Lord Hoffmann's observations in Belize Telecom, but the passage notes that those might not be authoritative anymore.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a discussion about rent not being apportionable under common law, but statutes like the Apportionment Act 1870 changed that. However, the lease in question was negotiated under the understanding that rent in advance isn't apportionable. The claimant wants to imply a term for apportionment, but the lease already has express provisions. The conflict here is between the implied term and the existing express terms, especially since the lease is detailed and includes similar obligations.\n\nThe user also asked about precedents. The APJ Priti case is mentioned as a precedent where implied terms were rejected. Also, the BP Refinery case and Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman are referenced, where the implication of terms was discussed. The Belize Telecom case is mentioned, but the passage notes that its observations aren't authoritative now.\n\nSo, the conflict arises when there's a tension between what the parties explicitly stated in the contract and what might be implied based on fairness or business needs. Precedents like APJ Priti and Philips show that courts are cautious about implying terms that conflict with express provisions, especially if the contract is detailed. The lease dispute here involves a term that would conflict with the existing express terms, making the implication problematic.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. For example, the conflict is explained in S22 (APJ Priti case), S24 (judicial approach), and S101 (lease being detailed with express obligations). The precedents would be S21 (APJ Priti), S22, and S101. Also, the part about the lease being negotiated under the understanding of non-apportionability is in S94 and S96."

[S25] It could be dangerous to reformulate the principles, but I would add six comments on the summary given by Lord Simon in BP Refinery as extended by Sir Thomas Bingham in Philips and exemplified in The APJ Priti. [S26] First, in *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* [2002] 1 AC 408, 459, Lord Steyn rightly observed that the implication of a term was \"not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties\" when negotiating the contract. [S27] If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting. [S28] Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. [S29] Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. [S30] However, and thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon's first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable. [S31] Fourthly, as Lord Hoffmann I think suggested in *Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd* [2009] 1 WLR 1988, para 27, although Lord Simon's requirements are otherwise cumulative, I would accept that business necessity and obviousness, his second and third requirements, can be alternatives in the sense that only one of them needs to be satisfied, although I suspect that in practice it would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied. [S32] Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is \"vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care\", to quote from Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts 5th ed (2011), para 6.09. [S33] Sixthly, necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment. [S34] It is rightly common ground on this appeal that the test is not one of \"absolute necessity\", not least because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. [S35] It may well be that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon's second requirement is, as suggested by Lord Sumption in argument, that a term can only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence. [S36] > \n> 22. [S37] Before leaving this issue of general principle, it is appropriate to refer a little further to *Belize Telecom*, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the process of implying terms into a contract was part of the exercise of the construction, or interpretation, of the contract.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S83] It is true that *Belize Telecom* was a unanimous decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that the judgment was given by Lord Hoffmann, whose contributions in so many areas of law have been outstanding. [S84] However, it is apparent that Lord Hoffmann's observations in *Belize Telecom*, paras 17-27 are open to more than one interpretation on the two points identified in paras 23-24 and 25-30 above, and that some of those interpretations are wrong in law.

[S88] Accordingly, if a lease under which the rent is payable in arrear was forfeited or came to an end prematurely for some other reason, the landlord loses the right to recover the rent due on the rent day following that determination, at least according to the common law - see eg *William Clun's Case* (1613) 10 Co Rep 127a . [S89] Parliament sought to remedy this initially in a limited way through the now repealed section 15 of the Distress for Rent Act 1737 and the Apportionment Act 1834, and then more comprehensively through the Apportionment Act 1870, which is still in force. [S90] Section 2 of the 1870 Act prospectively provides that \"All rents, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in the nature of income\" should \"like interest on money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day, and shall be apportionable in respect of time accordingly\".

[S94] The claimant's argument, by contrast, is that a term should be implied into the Lease that the Basic Rent payable in advance on 25 December 2011 should effectively be apportioned on a time basis. [S95] The fact that the Lease was negotiated against the background of a clear, general (and correct) understanding that rent payable in advance was not apportionable in time, raises a real problem for the argument that a term can be implied into the Lease that it should be effectively apportionable if the Lease is prematurely determined in accordance with its terms.

[S99] The point made in para 35, supported by what is said in para 34, provides real support for the proposition that, without the implied term, clause 8 would operate in a rather capricious way. [S100] On the other hand, as Mr Dowding QC rightly said on behalf of the defendants, the factors identified in paras 38-40 above chime with the warnings given by Sir Thomas Bingham in *Philips* and his reasons for rejecting an implied warranty in *APJ Priti*. [S101] The Lease is a very full and carefully considered contract, which includes express obligations of the same nature as the proposed implied term, namely financial liabilities in connection with the tenant's right to break, and that term would lie somewhat uneasily with some of those provisions.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the 'officious bystander' test in determining implied terms and why its application is considered critical according to the source material.\n\nFirst, I need to locate where the 'officious bystander' test is mentioned in the provided passages. Scanning through the text, I see in Passage 1, sentence [S32] mentions the officious bystander. The exact quote is: \"if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is 'vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care', to quote from Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts 5th ed (2011), para 6.09.\"\n\nSo, the role of the officious bystander test is to help determine if a term should be implied by considering what a hypothetical reasonable person (the officious bystander) would think the parties would agree to. The key point here is that the question posed to this bystander must be carefully formulated. This suggests that the test is a method to assess the reasonableness and necessity of an implied term.\n\nNow, why is its application critical? The source material emphasizes that formulating the question correctly is vital. If the question isn't properly framed, the test might not accurately reflect the parties' intentions. This careful formulation ensures that the implied term is not just based on fairness but is necessary for the contract's business efficacy. The mention in [S32] also ties into the broader principles discussed, like business necessity and obviousness, which are part of the criteria for implying terms. \n\nAdditionally, in [S35], there's a reference to Lord Sumption's suggestion that a term can only be implied if without it, the contract lacks commercial or practical coherence. This ties back to the officious bystander test's role in ensuring that the term is necessary for the contract's functionality. \n\nSo, the critical aspect is that the test requires precise question formulation to avoid misinterpretation and ensure the term is genuinely necessary, not just fair. This precision is crucial to maintain the integrity of the contract's terms and prevent arbitrary implications."

      "answer": "<statement>The Apportionment Act 1870 differs from common law in that it allows rent to be apportioned in time, whereas common law traditionally held that rent payable in arrear was not apportionable. Under common law, if a lease ended prematurely, the landlord lost the right to recover rent due after the termination, as noted in *William Clun's Case* (1613). The 1870 Act explicitly states that \"All rents... should... be apportionable in respect of time accordingly,\" overriding this common law restriction.<cite>[S88][S90]</cite></statement><statement>This distinction has implications for lease disputes, as the common law and statute do not apportion rent in advance on a time basis. The lease in question was negotiated under the understanding that rent payable in advance was not subject to time-based apportionment, creating challenges for arguments seeking to imply a term for such apportionment. This background undermines claims that a term should be implied to apportion rent in advance, as it would conflict with the lease's express terms and established legal principles.<cite>[S92][S93][S95][S96]</cite></statement>",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the Apportionment Act 1870 differs from common law in terms of rent apportionment and the implications for lease disputes. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The relevant parts are in Passage 2, specifically sentences S83 to S91. \n\nLooking at S83, it mentions that rent in common law isn't apportionable in time. Then S88 references \"William Clun's Case\" (1613) where the common law says the landlord can't recover rent after a lease ends prematurely. \n\nThen S89 talks about the Apportionment Act 1834 and 1870. The key part is S90, which states that the 1870 Act's Section 2 makes rents \"apportionable in respect of time accordingly.\" So the Act changes the common law by allowing apportionment, unlike the common law which didn't.\n\nThe user also asks about implications for lease disputes. From S92 and S93, it's clear that common law and statute don't apportion rent in advance. The claimant's argument is about implying a term for apportionment, but the Lease's background understanding was that rent in advance wasn't apportionable. This creates a problem for the claimant's argument, as per S95 and S96. \n\nSo the differentiation is that common law doesn't allow apportionment, while the 1870 Act does. The implication is that lease disputes might involve challenges to implied terms, but the existing lease terms and common understanding might prevent such implications, as seen in the discussion around S95-S102.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check for any other relevant sentences. For example, S90 directly mentions the 1870 Act's provision, and S88 and S89 explain the common law stance. Also, S92 and S93 clarify that statute doesn't apportion in advance, which ties into the implications for lease disputes."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that weigh against implying a term for rent apportionment in a lease and how these align with broader contractual interpretation principles.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several key points. Starting with Passage 1, there's a lot about the principles of implying terms in contracts. For example, in [S22], there's a reference to rejecting an implied term because the omission might have been deliberate, it's not necessary for business efficacy, and it would conflict with express terms. That seems relevant. Also, [S28] states that a term shouldn't be implied just because it's fair or the parties might have agreed if suggested, which are necessary but not sufficient grounds. \n\nThen in Passage 2, there's discussion about rent not being apportionable under common law [S88], and the Apportionment Act 1870. But the key part here is [S95] and [S96], which mention that the lease was negotiated with the understanding that rent in advance isn't apportionable, which creates a problem for implying such a term. Also, [S101] references Sir Thomas Bingham's reasons in Philips and APJ Priti, where he rejected implied terms due to potential conflict with existing express terms and the contract's completeness.\n\nSo the factors against implying the term would include: the lease being a detailed contract with express terms that might conflict, the historical understanding that rent in advance isn't apportionable, and the principle that implied terms shouldn't be added just based on fairness or hypothetical agreement. These align with the broader principles of contractual interpretation that emphasize the importance of express terms, business efficacy, and avoiding adding terms that conflict with the existing contract structure.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. For example, the part about the lease being detailed and conflicting terms would cite [S101]. The common law stance on rent apportionment would cite [S88] and [S96]. The principles from Philips and APJ Priti would be [S22] and [S101]. Also, the idea that implied terms shouldn't be based solely on fairness is from [S28]. \n\nI should structure the answer with each relevant factor as a separate statement, each citing the appropriate sentences. Need to check that all citations are correctly numbered and that each statement is concise."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S59] Whether or not one agrees with that approach as a matter of principle must depend on what precisely one understands by the word \"construction\". [S60] > \n> 26. [S61] I accept that both (i) construing the words which the parties have used in their contract and (ii) implying terms into the contract, involve determining the scope and meaning of the contract. [S62] However, Lord Hoffmann's analysis in Belize Telecom could obscure the fact that construing the words used and implying additional words are different processes governed by different rules. [S63] > \n> 27. [S64] Of course, it is fair to say that the factors to be taken into account on an issue of construction, namely the words used in the contract, the surrounding circumstances known to both parties at the time of the contract, commercial common sense, and the reasonable reader or reasonable parties, are also taken into account on an issue of implication. [S65] However, that does not mean that the exercise of implication should be properly classified as part of the exercise of interpretation, let alone that it should be carried out at the same time as interpretation. [S66] When one is implying a term or a phrase, one is not construing words, as the words to be implied are ex hypothesi not there to be construed; and to speak of construing the contract as a whole, including the implied terms, is not helpful, not least because it begs the question as to what construction actually means in this context. [S67] > \n> 28. [S68] In most, possibly all, disputes about whether a term should be implied into a contract, it is only after the process of construing the express words is complete that the issue of an implied term falls to be considered. [S69] Until one has decided what the parties have expressly agreed, it is difficult to see how one can set about deciding whether a term should be implied and if so what term. [S70] This appeal is just such a case. [S71] Further, given that it is a cardinal rule that no term can be implied into a contract if it contradicts an express term, it would seem logically to follow that, until the express terms of a contract have been construed, it is, at least normally, not sensibly possible to decide whether a further term should be implied. [S72] Having said that, I accept Lord Carnwath's point in para 71 to the extent that in some cases it could conceivably be appropriate to reconsider the interpretation of the express terms of a contract once one has decided whether to imply a term, but, even if that is right, it does not alter the fact that the express terms of a contract must be interpreted before one can consider any question of implication. [S73] > \n> 29. [S74] In any event, the process of implication involves a rather different exercise from that of construction. [S75] As Sir Thomas Bingham trenchantly explained in Philips at p 481:\n> \n> > \"The courts' usual role in contractual interpretation is, by resolving ambiguities or reconciling apparent inconsistencies, to attribute the true meaning to the language in which the parties themselves have expressed their contract. [S76] The implication of contract terms involves a different and altogether more ambitious undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal with matters for which, ex hypothesi, the parties themselves have made no provision. [S77] It is because the implication of terms is so potentially intrusive that the law imposes strict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary power.\"\n> \n> 30. [S78] It is of some interest to see how implication was dealt with in the recent case in this court of *Aberdeen City Council v Stewart Milne Group Ltd* 2012 SLT 205. [S79] At para 20, Lord Hope described the implication of a term into the contract in that case as \"the product of the way I would interpret this contract\". [S80] And at para 33, Lord Clarke said that the point at issue should be resolved \"by holding that such a term should be implied rather than by a process of interpretation\". [S81] He added that \"[t]he result is of course the same\". [S82] > \n> 31.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S104] Even if I would have reached that conclusion, I consider that it could not have stood once one faced up to the clear and consistent line of judicial decisions which formed the backcloth against which the terms of the Lease, and in particular the provisions of clause 8, were agreed. [S105] Save in a very clear case indeed, it would be wrong to attribute to a landlord and a tenant, particularly when they have entered into a full and professionally drafted lease, an intention that the tenant should receive an apportioned part of the rent payable and paid in advance, when the non-apportionability of such rent has been so long and clearly established. [S106] Given that it is so clear that the effect of the case-law is that rent payable and paid in advance can be retained by the landlord, save in very exceptional circumstances (eg where the contract could not work or would lead to an absurdity) express words would be needed before it would be right to imply a term to the contrary. [S107] > \n> 51. [S108] I accept that refusing to accede to the proposed implied term in this case can lead to the operation of clause 8 having the somewhat curious effect discussed in para 35 above.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors cited in the passage that support the argument that implying terms into a contract is a distinct and more intrusive exercise compared to contractual construction, and how this relates to judicial constraints on implication.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passages and identify the relevant sentences. The passage mentions several points. Let me start by breaking down the question into parts. \n\nThe first part is about the factors supporting the idea that implying terms is distinct and more intrusive. The second part is how this relates to judicial constraints.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a lot here. Let me check each sentence. \n\nIn [S61], it says that both construing the words and implying terms involve determining the scope and meaning. But then [S62] mentions that Lord Hoffmann's analysis might obscure that they are different processes with different rules. That's a key point. \n\nThen [S64] talks about factors for construction like words used, surrounding circumstances, commercial common sense, etc., which are also considered in implication. However, [S65] states that this doesn't mean implication is part of interpretation. [S66] explains that when implying a term, you're not construing existing words, as they aren't there. [S67] adds that speaking of construing the contract as a whole including implied terms is not helpful because it begs the question. \n\n[S68] mentions that implication is considered after construing express words. [S74] directly states that implication involves a different exercise from construction. Then [S76] and [S77] from Sir Thomas Bingham's quote: the courts' role is to resolve ambiguities, while implication is more ambitious, inserting terms where parties didn't provide. [S77] also notes that implication is potentially intrusive, leading to strict constraints. \n\nIn Passage 2, [S106] mentions that express words are needed to imply a term contrary to established case law, indicating judicial constraints. [S107] reinforces that strict constraints apply unless in very clear cases. \n\nSo the factors supporting the distinctness are the different processes (construing vs. implying), the need for different rules, the fact that implication adds terms not present, and the judicial constraints due to its intrusiveness. The relation to judicial constraints is that because implication is more intrusive, the law imposes strict constraints to prevent overreach.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the relevant citations. Let me check each point again to ensure I'm citing the right sentences.\n\nFor example, the distinct processes are mentioned in [S62], [S64]-[S66], [S74], [S76]-[S77]. The judicial constraints are in [S77], [S106], [S107]. \n\nI need to make sure each statement in the answer is backed by the correct citations. Also, avoid combining multiple points into one sentence unless they are directly related. Let me draft the answer step by step."

There are two passages here, Passage 1 and Passage 2.

Sentence [S108] mentions that refusing the implied term could lead to a \"somewhat curious effect\" discussed earlier.

This shows that courts are cautious about implying terms, only doing so in very clear cases. They prioritize the express terms and the established case law, even if it leads to some unfairness. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's discussion about implication vs. construction, emphasizing that implication is a separate process and requires strict constraints. This supports the idea that courts are hesitant to imply terms unless necessary, which aligns with the reasoning in Passage 2.\n\nSo the answer should mention that the passage acknowledges potential anomalies but maintains the principle due to strict constraints on implication.

[S110] Indeed, the result cannot be said to be commercially or otherwise absurd, particularly as it is entirely up to the tenant as to when that sum is paid.

        "[S59] Whether or not one agrees with that approach as a matter of principle must depend on what precisely one understands by the word \"construction\". [S60] > \n> 26. [S61] I accept that both (i) construing the words which the parties have used in their contract and (ii) implying terms into the contract, involve determining the scope and meaning of the contract. [S62] However, Lord Hoffmann's analysis in Belize Telecom could obscure the fact that construing the words used and implying additional words are different processes governed by different rules. [S63] > \n> 27. [S64] Of course, it is fair to say that the factors to be taken into account on an issue of construction, namely the words used in the contract, the surrounding circumstances known to both parties at the time of the contract, commercial common sense, and the reasonable reader or reasonable parties, are also taken into account on an issue of implication. [S65] However, that does not mean that the exercise of implication should be properly classified as part of the exercise of interpretation, let alone that it should be carried out at the same time as interpretation. [S66] When one is implying a term or a phrase, one is not construing words, as the words to be implied are ex hypothesi not there to be construed; and to speak of construing the contract as a whole, including the implied terms, is not helpful, not least because it begs the question as to what construction actually means in this context. [S67] > \n> 28. [S68] In most, possibly all, disputes about whether a term should be implied into a contract, it is only after the process of construing the express words is complete that the issue of an implied term falls to be considered. [S69] Until one has decided what the parties have expressly agreed, it is difficult to see how one can set about deciding whether a term should be implied and if so what term. [S70] This appeal is just such a case. [S71] Further, given that it is a cardinal rule that no term can be implied into a contract if it contradicts an express term, it would seem logically to follow that, until the express terms of a contract have been construed, it is, at least normally, not sensibly possible to decide whether a further term should be implied. [S72] Having said that, I accept Lord Carnwath's point in para 71 to the extent that in some cases it could conceivably be appropriate to reconsider the interpretation of the express terms of a contract once one has decided whether to imply a term, but, even if that is right, it does not alter the fact that the express terms of a contract must be interpreted before one can consider any question of implication. [S73] > \n> 29. [S74] In any event, the process of implication involves a rather different exercise from that of construction. [S75] As Sir Thomas Bingham trenchantly explained in Philips at p 481:\n> \n> > \"The courts' usual role in contractual interpretation is, by resolving ambiguities or reconciling apparent inconsistencies, to attribute the true meaning to the language in which the parties themselves have expressed their contract. [S76] The implication of contract terms involves a different and altogether more ambitious undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal with matters for which, ex hypothesi, the parties themselves have made no provision. [S77] It is because the implication of terms is so potentially intrusive that the law imposes strict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary power.\"\n> \n> 30. [S78] It is of some interest to see how implication was dealt with in the recent case in this court of *Aberdeen City Council v Stewart Milne Group Ltd* 2012 SLT 205. [S79] At para 20, Lord Hope described the implication of a term into the contract in that case as \"the product of the way I would interpret this contract\". [S80] And at para 33, Lord Clarke said that the point at issue should be resolved \"by holding that such a term should be implied rather than by a process of interpretation\". [S81] He added that \"[t]he result is of course the same\". [S82] > \n> 31.",
        "[S104] Even if I would have reached that conclusion, I consider that it could not have stood once one faced up to the clear and consistent line of judicial decisions which formed the backcloth against which the terms of the Lease, and in particular the provisions of clause 8, were agreed. [S105] Save in a very clear case indeed, it would be wrong to attribute to a landlord and a tenant, particularly when they have entered into a full and professionally drafted lease, an intention that the tenant should receive an apportioned part of the rent payable and paid in advance, when the non-apportionability of such rent has been so long and clearly established. [S106] Given that it is so clear that the effect of the case-law is that rent payable and paid in advance can be retained by the landlord, save in very exceptional circumstances (eg where the contract could not work or would lead to an absurdity) express words would be needed before it would be right to imply a term to the contrary. [S107] > \n> 51. [S108] I accept that refusing to accede to the proposed implied term in this case can lead to the operation of clause 8 having the somewhat curious effect discussed in para 35 above. [S109] However, while the difference in result between the tenant paying the \u00a3919,800 plus VAT before or after 25 December 2011 can fairly be said to be capricious or anomalous, it does not begin to justify a suggestion that the contract is unworkable.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the references to Belize Telecom and Aberdeen City Council v Stewart Milne Group Ltd illustrate tensions between interpretation and implication in contractual analysis, and how these cases inform the passage's conclusions.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nStarting with Belize Telecom. In the passage, sentence [S62] mentions Lord Hoffmann's analysis in Belize Telecom, stating that construing words and implying terms are different processes with different rules. That seems to highlight the distinction between interpretation (construing words) and implication (adding terms). Then, in [S74], it says the process of implication is different from construction, citing Philips. Also, in [S78], the case Aberdeen City Council v Stewart Milne Group Ltd is mentioned where Lord Hope and Lord Clarke discuss implication versus interpretation. \n\nThe user wants to know how these cases show tensions between interpretation and implication. From the context, the passage argues that interpretation involves understanding existing words, while implication adds terms not present. The cases are used to show that courts sometimes blur these lines, but the passage emphasizes they are distinct. For example, in [S62], Belize Telecom is cited to show that these are separate processes. In [S78]-[S82], Aberdeen City Council is discussed where the court's approach might mix interpretation and implication, but the passage points out that implication is a separate exercise.\n\nThe passage's conclusion seems to be that interpretation must come before implication, as per [S68] and [S72], where it's stated that express terms must be construed first. The cases are used to support this by showing that even though there might be overlap, the processes are distinct and should be handled separately.\n\nSo, the answer should connect the cases to the distinction between interpretation and implication, citing the relevant sentences. The tension arises because courts might conflate the two, but the passage argues they are separate. The citations would be [S62], [S74], [S78]-[S82], and maybe [S76]-[S77] from Philips. Also, [S104]-[S107] in Passage 2 might relate to the strict constraints on implication, but the main cases are Belize Telecom and Aberdeen."

The user is asking how the passage addresses the distinction between 'reasonableness' and 'necessity' in implied contractual terms and what examples are provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections, Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me start by scanning through each part for mentions of 'reasonableness' and 'necessity'.\n\nIn Passage 1, starting at [S40], there's a discussion about the reasonable reader understanding a term. It says that the reasonable reader would consider the term obvious or necessary for business efficacy. Then, there's a note that the difference between what a reasonable reader understands and what the parties would agree might be a notional distinction without practical difference. \n\nFurther down, [S43] mentions that the first proviso emphasizes the term is judged at the contract's creation date. [S44] talks about Lord Hoffmann's formulation possibly being seen as reasonableness being sufficient, but the passage argues against that, stating that necessity is still required. There's a citation to Lord Steyn's statement in *Equitable Life* where he mentions \"essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations\" but clarifies that the legal test is strict necessity. \n\nIn [S45], it's stated that Lord Steyn's earlier statement on \"strict necessity\" is a \"stringent test,\" reinforcing that necessity is key. Then, in Passage 2, [S136] and [S137] discuss Lord Hoffmann's view that implication is part of construction, but [S138] mentions that construing existing words vs. implying terms are different. However, both are part of construction in a broad sense. [S142] reiterates that Belize didn't water down the necessity test, and [S143] refers to Lord Wilberforce's discussion on necessity for the contract to work.\n\nExamples given include the cases like *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman*, *Liverpool City Council v Irwin*, and academic articles. Also, the Singapore Court of Appeal cases (*Foo Jong Peng v Phua Kiah Mai* and *Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd*) are mentioned as examples where the law wasn't diluted.\n\nSo, the passage distinguishes between reasonableness (which is not sufficient on its own) and necessity (which is required). The examples include specific cases and academic references. I need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences and include the examples as per the citations."

[S58] in detaching the phrase 'necessary to give business efficacy' from the basic process of construction\".\n\nPassage 2:\n[S135] > 76. [S136] As Lord Carnwath says at para 62, I did not doubt Lord Hoffmann's observation that \"the implication of a term is an exercise in the construction of the contract as a whole\". [S137] I recognise, however, in the light of Lord Neuberger's judgment, especially at paras 22 to 31, that Lord Hoffmann's view involves giving a wide meaning to \"construction\" because, as Lord Neuberger says at para 27, when one is implying a word or phrase, one is not construing words in the contract because the words to be implied are *ex hypothesi* and not there to be construed. [S138] However, like Lord Neuberger (at para 26) I accept that both (i) construing the words which the parties have used in their contract and (ii) implying terms into the contract, involve determining the scope and meaning of the contract. [S139] On that basis it can properly be said that both processes are part of construction of the contract in a broad sense. [S140] > 77. [S141] I agree with Lord Neuberger and Lord Carnwath that the critical point is that in Belize the Judicial Committee was not watering down the traditional test of necessity. [S142] I adhere to the view I expressed at para 15 of my judgment in the *Mediterranean Salvage & Towage case* (which is quoted by Lord Carnwath at para 62) that in *Belize*, although Lord Hoffmann emphasised that the process of implication was part of the process of construction of the contract, he was not resiling from the often stated proposition that it must be necessary to imply the term and that it is not sufficient that it would be reasonable to do so. [S143] Another way of putting the test of necessity is to ask whether it is necessary to do so in order to make the contract work: see the detailed discussion by Lord Wilberforce in *Liverpool City Council v Irwin* [1977] AC 239, 253-254.",

        "[S38] In summary, he said at para 21 that \"[t]here is only one question: is that what the instrument, read as a whole against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean?\". [S39] There are two points to be made about that observation. [S40] > \n> 23. [S41] First, the notion that a term will be implied if a reasonable reader of the contract, knowing all its provisions and the surrounding circumstances, would understand it to be implied is quite acceptable, provided that (i) the reasonable reader is treated as reading the contract at the time it was made and (ii) he would consider the term to be so obvious as to go without saying or to be necessary for business efficacy. [S42] (The difference between what the reasonable reader would understand and what the parties, acting reasonably, would agree, appears to me to be a notional distinction without a practical difference.) The first proviso emphasises that the question whether a term is implied is to be judged at the date the contract is made. [S43] The second proviso is important because otherwise Lord Hoffmann's formulation may be interpreted as suggesting that reasonableness is a sufficient ground for implying a term. [S44] (For the same reason, it would be wrong to treat Lord Steyn's statement in *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* [2002] 1 AC 408, 459 that a term will be implied if it is \"essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties\" as diluting the test of necessity. [S45] That is clear from what Lord Steyn said earlier on the same page, namely that \"[t]he legal test for the implication of ... [S46] a term is ... [S47] strict necessity\", which he described as a \"stringent test\".)\n> \n> 24. [S48] It is necessary to emphasise that there has been no dilution of the requirements which have to be satisfied before a term will be implied, because it is apparent that Belize Telecom has been interpreted by both academic lawyers and judges as having changed the law. [S49] Examples of academic articles include C Peters The implication of terms in fact [2009] CLJ 513, P Davies, Recent developments in the Law of Implied Terms [2010] LMCLQ 140, J McCaughran Implied terms: the journey of the man on the Clapham Omnibus [2011] CLJ 607, and JW Carter and W Courtney, Belize Telecom: a reply to Professor McLauchlan [2015] LMCLQ 245). [S50] And in *Foo Jong Peng v Phua Kiah Mai* [2012] 4 SLR 1267, paras 34-36, the Singapore Court of Appeal refused to follow the reasoning in Belize at least in so far as \"it suggest[ed] that the traditional 'business efficacy' and 'officious bystander' tests are not central to the implication of terms\" (reasoning which was followed in *Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd* [2013] SGCA 43). [S51] The Singapore Court of Appeal were in my view right to hold that the law governing the circumstances in which a term will be implied into a contract remains unchanged following *Belize Telecom*. [S52] > \n> 25. [S53] The second point to be made about what was said in *Belize Telecom* concerns the suggestion that the process of implying a term is part of the exercise of interpretation. [S54] Although some support may arguably be found for such a view in Trollope at p 609, the first clear expression of that view to which we were referred was in *Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd* [1997] AC 191, 212, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the issue of whether to imply a term into a contract was \"one of construction of the agreement as a whole in its commercial setting\". [S55] Lord Steyn quoted this passage with approval in Equitable Life at p 459, and, as just mentioned, Lord Hoffmann took this proposition further in Belize Telecom, paras 17-27.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the passages discuss the relationship between the implication of terms and the construction of a contract, and what the judicial perspective is on this.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. There are two passages here, both from legal discussions about implied terms in contracts. \n\nStarting with Passage 1, there's a lot about the test for implying terms. The key points seem to be that a term is implied if a reasonable reader would understand it to be implied, considering the contract as a whole and the circumstances. There are two provisos: the reasonable reader must consider the term obvious or necessary for business efficacy. Also, there's mention of Lord Hoffmann's view that implying a term is part of the contract's construction. The passages also note that some courts, like in Singapore, have rejected interpretations that dilute the traditional tests, emphasizing that necessity is still required, not just reasonableness.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a discussion about whether implying terms is part of contract construction. Lord Carnwath and others acknowledge that while implying terms isn't construing existing words, both construing existing terms and implying new ones are part of the broader construction process. They stress that the traditional necessity test remains, and Lord Hoffmann didn't weaken that. The judicial perspective here seems to be that even though the process is part of construction, the necessity requirement is still strict.\n\nSo, the relationship between implication and construction is that implying terms is seen as part of interpreting the contract as a whole. The judicial perspective is that necessity (not just reasonableness) is required, and there's a focus on the contract's business efficacy. The citations would be from the sections where these points are made, like S40, S41, S43, S54, S55, S56, S136, S137, S138, S142, etc.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Each statement should address a part of the question, linking the implication of terms to contract construction and the judicial view on necessity versus reasonableness."

    "[S1] Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd\n\n\n# Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd\n\n\n\n***Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd*** [2015] UKSC 72 is an English contract law case, concerning the implication of terms in commercial contracts, and business tenancies agreed between multinational corporations. [S2] ## Facts\n\nMarks & Spencer, which was subleasing \u2018The Point\u2019 in Paddington Basin, W2 from BNP Paribas, claimed there should be an implied right to recover money that it had paid under its lease when it exercised the right to terminate. [S3] The basic rent was \u00a31.23m a year, plus a premium of \u00a3919,800 plus VAT, service charge, and a car park licence fee. [S4] The rent had to be paid by the quarter. [S5] The landlord could recover by rent a \u2018fair proportion\u2019 of building insurance costs and building service charges. [S6] Clause 8 allowed M&S to end the lease on 24 January 2012 with 6 months advance notice if there were no arrears in rent, and this meant the rent needed to be paid up to the end of the quarter, which was longer than the time M&S occupied the property. [S7] M&S did so, and then claimed it should get back the rent from 25 January to 24 March 2012. [S8] The default law on apportionability would have suggested the rent could not be recovered, under the Apportionment Act 1870, but it was argued that it was an implication of the contract that it should be. [S9] ## Judgment\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the term in the lease to recover the extra portion of the rent should not be implied. [S10] The Court discussed and affirmed Lord Hoffmann's views in *AG of Belize*, noting that implication was part of the process of \"determining the scope and meaning of the contract\". [S11] Lord Neuberger (with whom Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge concurred) said the following. [S12] > 18. [S13] In the Privy Council case of *BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings* (1977) 52 ALJR 20, [1977] UKPC 13, 26, Lord Simon (speaking for the majority, which included Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Keith) said that:\n> \n> > \"[F]or a term to be implied, the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that 'it goes without saying'; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract.\"\n> \n> 19. [S14] In *Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd* [1995] EMLR 472, 481, Sir Thomas Bingham MR set out Lord Simon's formulation, and described it as a summary which \"distil[led] the essence of much learning on implied terms\" but whose \"simplicity could be almost misleading\". [S15] Sir Thomas then explained that it was \"difficult to infer with confidence what the parties must have intended when they have entered into a lengthy and carefully-drafted contract but have omitted to make provision for the matter in issue\", because \"it may well be doubtful whether the omission was the result of the parties' oversight or of their deliberate decision\", or indeed the parties might suspect that \"they are unlikely to agree on what is to happen in a certain ... [S16] eventuality\" and \"may well choose to leave the matter uncovered in their contract in the hope that the eventuality will not occur\". [S17] Sir Thomas went on to say this at p 482:\n> \n> > \"The question of whether a term should be implied, and if so what, almost inevitably arises after a crisis has been reached in the performance of the contract. [S18] So the court comes to the task of implication with the benefit of hindsight, and it is tempting for the court then to fashion a term which will reflect the merits of the situation as they then appear. [S19] Tempting, but wrong.",
    "[S20] [He then quoted the observations of Scrutton LJ in Reigate, and continued] [I]t is not enough to show that had the parties foreseen the eventuality which in fact occurred they would have wished to make provision for it, unless it can also be shown either that there was only one contractual solution or that one of several possible solutions would without doubt have been preferred ...\"\n> \n> 20. [S21] Sir Thomas's approach in Philips was consistent with his reasoning, as Bingham LJ in the earlier case The APJ Priti [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 37, 42, where he rejected the argument that a warranty, to the effect that the port declared was prospectively safe, could be implied into a voyage charter-party. [S22] His reasons for rejecting the implication were \"because the omission of an express warranty may well have been deliberate, because such an implied term is not necessary for the business efficacy of the charter and because such an implied term would at best lie uneasily beside the express terms of the charter\". [S23] > \n> 21. [S24] In my judgment, the judicial observations so far considered represent a clear, consistent and principled approach. [S25] It could be dangerous to reformulate the principles, but I would add six comments on the summary given by Lord Simon in BP Refinery as extended by Sir Thomas Bingham in Philips and exemplified in The APJ Priti. [S26] First, in *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* [2002] 1 AC 408, 459, Lord Steyn rightly observed that the implication of a term was \"not critically dependent on proof of an actual intention of the parties\" when negotiating the contract. [S27] If one approaches the question by reference to what the parties would have agreed, one is not strictly concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting. [S28] Secondly, a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appears fair or merely because one considers that the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them. [S29] Those are necessary but not sufficient grounds for including a term. [S30] However, and thirdly, it is questionable whether Lord Simon's first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, will usually, if ever, add anything: if a term satisfies the other requirements, it is hard to think that it would not be reasonable and equitable. [S31] Fourthly, as Lord Hoffmann I think suggested in *Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd* [2009] 1 WLR 1988, para 27, although Lord Simon's requirements are otherwise cumulative, I would accept that business necessity and obviousness, his second and third requirements, can be alternatives in the sense that only one of them needs to be satisfied, although I suspect that in practice it would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied. [S32] Fifthly, if one approaches the issue by reference to the officious bystander, it is \"vital to formulate the question to be posed by [him] with the utmost care\", to quote from Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts 5th ed (2011), para 6.09. [S33] Sixthly, necessity for business efficacy involves a value judgment. [S34] It is rightly common ground on this appeal that the test is not one of \"absolute necessity\", not least because the necessity is judged by reference to business efficacy. [S35] It may well be that a more helpful way of putting Lord Simon's second requirement is, as suggested by Lord Sumption in argument, that a term can only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence. [S36] > \n> 22. [S37] Before leaving this issue of general principle, it is appropriate to refer a little further to *Belize Telecom*, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the process of implying terms into a contract was part of the exercise of the construction, or interpretation, of the contract.",
    "[S38] In summary, he said at para 21 that \"[t]here is only one question: is that what the instrument, read as a whole against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean?\". [S39] There are two points to be made about that observation. [S40] > \n> 23. [S41] First, the notion that a term will be implied if a reasonable reader of the contract, knowing all its provisions and the surrounding circumstances, would understand it to be implied is quite acceptable, provided that (i) the reasonable reader is treated as reading the contract at the time it was made and (ii) he would consider the term to be so obvious as to go without saying or to be necessary for business efficacy. [S42] (The difference between what the reasonable reader would understand and what the parties, acting reasonably, would agree, appears to me to be a notional distinction without a practical difference.) The first proviso emphasises that the question whether a term is implied is to be judged at the date the contract is made. [S43] The second proviso is important because otherwise Lord Hoffmann's formulation may be interpreted as suggesting that reasonableness is a sufficient ground for implying a term. [S44] (For the same reason, it would be wrong to treat Lord Steyn's statement in *Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman* [2002] 1 AC 408, 459 that a term will be implied if it is \"essential to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties\" as diluting the test of necessity. [S45] That is clear from what Lord Steyn said earlier on the same page, namely that \"[t]he legal test for the implication of ... [S46] a term is ... [S47] strict necessity\", which he described as a \"stringent test\".)\n> \n> 24. [S48] It is necessary to emphasise that there has been no dilution of the requirements which have to be satisfied before a term will be implied, because it is apparent that Belize Telecom has been interpreted by both academic lawyers and judges as having changed the law. [S49] Examples of academic articles include C Peters The implication of terms in fact [2009] CLJ 513, P Davies, Recent developments in the Law of Implied Terms [2010] LMCLQ 140, J McCaughran Implied terms: the journey of the man on the Clapham Omnibus [2011] CLJ 607, and JW Carter and W Courtney, Belize Telecom: a reply to Professor McLauchlan [2015] LMCLQ 245). [S50] And in *Foo Jong Peng v Phua Kiah Mai* [2012] 4 SLR 1267, paras 34-36, the Singapore Court of Appeal refused to follow the reasoning in Belize at least in so far as \"it suggest[ed] that the traditional 'business efficacy' and 'officious bystander' tests are not central to the implication of terms\" (reasoning which was followed in *Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd* [2013] SGCA 43). [S51] The Singapore Court of Appeal were in my view right to hold that the law governing the circumstances in which a term will be implied into a contract remains unchanged following *Belize Telecom*. [S52] > \n> 25. [S53] The second point to be made about what was said in *Belize Telecom* concerns the suggestion that the process of implying a term is part of the exercise of interpretation. [S54] Although some support may arguably be found for such a view in Trollope at p 609, the first clear expression of that view to which we were referred was in *Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd* [1997] AC 191, 212, where Lord Hoffmann suggested that the issue of whether to imply a term into a contract was \"one of construction of the agreement as a whole in its commercial setting\". [S55] Lord Steyn quoted this passage with approval in Equitable Life at p 459, and, as just mentioned, Lord Hoffmann took this proposition further in Belize Telecom, paras 17-27. [S56] Thus, at para 18, he said that \"the implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument. [S57] It only spells out what the instrument means\"; and at para 23, he referred to \"The danger ... [S58] in detaching the phrase 'necessary to give business efficacy' from the basic process of construction\".",
    "[S59] Whether or not one agrees with that approach as a matter of principle must depend on what precisely one understands by the word \"construction\". [S60] > \n> 26. [S61] I accept that both (i) construing the words which the parties have used in their contract and (ii) implying terms into the contract, involve determining the scope and meaning of the contract. [S62] However, Lord Hoffmann's analysis in Belize Telecom could obscure the fact that construing the words used and implying additional words are different processes governed by different rules. [S63] > \n> 27. [S64] Of course, it is fair to say that the factors to be taken into account on an issue of construction, namely the words used in the contract, the surrounding circumstances known to both parties at the time of the contract, commercial common sense, and the reasonable reader or reasonable parties, are also taken into account on an issue of implication. [S65] However, that does not mean that the exercise of implication should be properly classified as part of the exercise of interpretation, let alone that it should be carried out at the same time as interpretation. [S66] When one is implying a term or a phrase, one is not construing words, as the words to be implied are ex hypothesi not there to be construed; and to speak of construing the contract as a whole, including the implied terms, is not helpful, not least because it begs the question as to what construction actually means in this context. [S67] > \n> 28. [S68] In most, possibly all, disputes about whether a term should be implied into a contract, it is only after the process of construing the express words is complete that the issue of an implied term falls to be considered. [S69] Until one has decided what the parties have expressly agreed, it is difficult to see how one can set about deciding whether a term should be implied and if so what term. [S70] This appeal is just such a case. [S71] Further, given that it is a cardinal rule that no term can be implied into a contract if it contradicts an express term, it would seem logically to follow that, until the express terms of a contract have been construed, it is, at least normally, not sensibly possible to decide whether a further term should be implied. [S72] Having said that, I accept Lord Carnwath's point in para 71 to the extent that in some cases it could conceivably be appropriate to reconsider the interpretation of the express terms of a contract once one has decided whether to imply a term, but, even if that is right, it does not alter the fact that the express terms of a contract must be interpreted before one can consider any question of implication. [S73] > \n> 29. [S74] In any event, the process of implication involves a rather different exercise from that of construction. [S75] As Sir Thomas Bingham trenchantly explained in Philips at p 481:\n> \n> > \"The courts' usual role in contractual interpretation is, by resolving ambiguities or reconciling apparent inconsistencies, to attribute the true meaning to the language in which the parties themselves have expressed their contract. [S76] The implication of contract terms involves a different and altogether more ambitious undertaking: the interpolation of terms to deal with matters for which, ex hypothesi, the parties themselves have made no provision. [S77] It is because the implication of terms is so potentially intrusive that the law imposes strict constraints on the exercise of this extraordinary power.\"\n> \n> 30. [S78] It is of some interest to see how implication was dealt with in the recent case in this court of *Aberdeen City Council v Stewart Milne Group Ltd* 2012 SLT 205. [S79] At para 20, Lord Hope described the implication of a term into the contract in that case as \"the product of the way I would interpret this contract\". [S80] And at para 33, Lord Clarke said that the point at issue should be resolved \"by holding that such a term should be implied rather than by a process of interpretation\". [S81] He added that \"[t]he result is of course the same\". [S82] > \n> 31.",
    "[S83] It is true that *Belize Telecom* was a unanimous decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and that the judgment was given by Lord Hoffmann, whose contributions in so many areas of law have been outstanding. [S84] However, it is apparent that Lord Hoffmann's observations in *Belize Telecom*, paras 17-27 are open to more than one interpretation on the two points identified in paras 23-24 and 25-30 above, and that some of those interpretations are wrong in law. [S85] In those circumstances, the right course for us to take is to say that those observations should henceforth be treated as a characteristically inspired discussion rather than authoritative guidance on the law of implied terms. [S86] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 43. [S87] It has long been well established that rent, whether payable in arrear or advance, is not apportionable in time in common law. [S88] Accordingly, if a lease under which the rent is payable in arrear was forfeited or came to an end prematurely for some other reason, the landlord loses the right to recover the rent due on the rent day following that determination, at least according to the common law - see eg *William Clun's Case* (1613) 10 Co Rep 127a . [S89] Parliament sought to remedy this initially in a limited way through the now repealed section 15 of the Distress for Rent Act 1737 and the Apportionment Act 1834, and then more comprehensively through the Apportionment Act 1870, which is still in force. [S90] Section 2 of the 1870 Act prospectively provides that \"All rents, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in the nature of income\" should \"like interest on money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day, and shall be apportionable in respect of time accordingly\". [S91] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 46. [S92] It follows from this conclusion that neither the common law nor statute apportions rent in advance on a time basis. [S93] And this was, correctly, generally understood to be the position when the Deed and the Lease were negotiated and executed. [S94] The claimant's argument, by contrast, is that a term should be implied into the Lease that the Basic Rent payable in advance on 25 December 2011 should effectively be apportioned on a time basis. [S95] The fact that the Lease was negotiated against the background of a clear, general (and correct) understanding that rent payable in advance was not apportionable in time, raises a real problem for the argument that a term can be implied into the Lease that it should be effectively apportionable if the Lease is prematurely determined in accordance with its terms. [S96] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 49. [S97] If one concentrates on the factors identified in paras 33-35 above, there appears to be a strong case for the implied term for which Mr Fetherstonhaugh QC powerfully argued on behalf of the claimant. [S98] The point made in para 33 supports the contention that, not merely would an implied term be fair, but that clause 8 could be said to work rather unfairly without the implied term. [S99] The point made in para 35, supported by what is said in para 34, provides real support for the proposition that, without the implied term, clause 8 would operate in a rather capricious way. [S100] On the other hand, as Mr Dowding QC rightly said on behalf of the defendants, the factors identified in paras 38-40 above chime with the warnings given by Sir Thomas Bingham in *Philips* and his reasons for rejecting an implied warranty in *APJ Priti*. [S101] The Lease is a very full and carefully considered contract, which includes express obligations of the same nature as the proposed implied term, namely financial liabilities in connection with the tenant's right to break, and that term would lie somewhat uneasily with some of those provisions. [S102] > \n> 50. [S103] There is little point in resolving the hypothetical question whether, in the absence of the points discussed in paras 43-49 above, I would have concluded that a term should be implied as the claimant contends.",
    "[S104] Even if I would have reached that conclusion, I consider that it could not have stood once one faced up to the clear and consistent line of judicial decisions which formed the backcloth against which the terms of the Lease, and in particular the provisions of clause 8, were agreed. [S105] Save in a very clear case indeed, it would be wrong to attribute to a landlord and a tenant, particularly when they have entered into a full and professionally drafted lease, an intention that the tenant should receive an apportioned part of the rent payable and paid in advance, when the non-apportionability of such rent has been so long and clearly established. [S106] Given that it is so clear that the effect of the case-law is that rent payable and paid in advance can be retained by the landlord, save in very exceptional circumstances (eg where the contract could not work or would lead to an absurdity) express words would be needed before it would be right to imply a term to the contrary. [S107] > \n> 51. [S108] I accept that refusing to accede to the proposed implied term in this case can lead to the operation of clause 8 having the somewhat curious effect discussed in para 35 above. [S109] However, while the difference in result between the tenant paying the \u00a3919,800 plus VAT before or after 25 December 2011 can fairly be said to be capricious or anomalous, it does not begin to justify a suggestion that the contract is unworkable. [S110] Indeed, the result cannot be said to be commercially or otherwise absurd, particularly as it is entirely up to the tenant as to when that sum is paid. [S111] Further, the fact that rent payable in advance is not apportionable can always lead to potential unfairness. [S112] For instance, a landlord with a right to forfeit on 23 March for a continuing breach of covenant could wait for three days to re-enter, in order to be able to receive the whole of the rent due in respect of the quarter to 24 June.... [S113] Lord Carnwath concurred, saying that he did not see a substantive difference between Lord Neuberger's approach and Lord Hoffmann's approach in *AG of Belize*.",
    "[S114] > 57. [S115] I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Lord Neuberger so far as addressed to the issues between the parties. [S116] I add some brief comments only on the issue of implied terms, and in particular Lord Neuberger's comments on the status of the Privy Council judgment in the Belize case. [S117] > \n> 58. [S118] Unlike him, I would have been content to take my starting point not in the 19th century cases (such as *The Moorcock*), but in the most modern treatment at the highest level. [S119] That is undoubtedly to be found in the judgment of the Privy Council in the Belize case (*Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd* [2009] 1 WLR 1988). [S120] It is important to remember that this was not an expression of the views of Lord Hoffmann alone, as is implied in some commentaries, but was the considered and unanimous judgment of the Board as a whole (including Lady Hale, and Lord Rodger, Lord Carswell, Lord Brown, none of them known for lack of independent thought). [S121] In the leading textbook on the subject (Lewison, Interpretation of Contracts 5th ed (2014)), the judgment is realistically taken to \"represent the current state of the law of England and Wales\" (p 284, para 6.03). [S122] > \n> [...]\n> \n> 71. [S123] In the same way the passages cited from Aberdeen City Council do not appear to support a sharp distinction between interpretation and implication, still less for the necessity of a sequential approach. [S124] No one thought it necessary to refer to Belize. [S125] Lord Clarke preferred implication, but acknowledged that the two processes achieved the same result. [S126] There is no indication that he had changed his view since Mediterranean Salvage. [S127] He seems to have treated them as two sides of the same coin. [S128] Lord Hope who gave the lead speech (which also had majority support) clearly saw them as part of a single exercise: the implied term was the \"product\" of interpretation. [S129] The case seems if anything to illustrate an \"iterative\", rather than sequential, process (see Lord Grabiner, The iterative process of contractual interpretation (2012) 128 LQR 41). [S130] The results of different interpretative techniques were considered and compared, in the light of the language used and its business context, to achieve a result which best represented the assumed intentions of the parties. [S131] > \n> 72. [S132] On the second point, in so far as there is a difference from the Singapore court, I prefer the approach of Lord Neuberger which seems to me entirely consistent with Belize. [S133] As he says (para 21), one is concerned not with \"the hypothetical answer of the actual parties\", but with that of \"notional reasonable people in the position of the parties at the time at which they were contracting\", or in other words of Lord Hoffmann's \"reasonable addressee\" (*Belize*, para 18). [S134] Lord Clarke gave a concurring judgment.",
    "[S135] > 76. [S136] As Lord Carnwath says at para 62, I did not doubt Lord Hoffmann's observation that \"the implication of a term is an exercise in the construction of the contract as a whole\". [S137] I recognise, however, in the light of Lord Neuberger's judgment, especially at paras 22 to 31, that Lord Hoffmann's view involves giving a wide meaning to \"construction\" because, as Lord Neuberger says at para 27, when one is implying a word or phrase, one is not construing words in the contract because the words to be implied are *ex hypothesi* and not there to be construed. [S138] However, like Lord Neuberger (at para 26) I accept that both (i) construing the words which the parties have used in their contract and (ii) implying terms into the contract, involve determining the scope and meaning of the contract. [S139] On that basis it can properly be said that both processes are part of construction of the contract in a broad sense. [S140] > 77. [S141] I agree with Lord Neuberger and Lord Carnwath that the critical point is that in Belize the Judicial Committee was not watering down the traditional test of necessity. [S142] I adhere to the view I expressed at para 15 of my judgment in the *Mediterranean Salvage & Towage case* (which is quoted by Lord Carnwath at para 62) that in *Belize*, although Lord Hoffmann emphasised that the process of implication was part of the process of construction of the contract, he was not resiling from the often stated proposition that it must be necessary to imply the term and that it is not sufficient that it would be reasonable to do so. [S143] Another way of putting the test of necessity is to ask whether it is necessary to do so in order to make the contract work: see the detailed discussion by Lord Wilberforce in *Liverpool City Council v Irwin* [1977] AC 239, 253-254."
