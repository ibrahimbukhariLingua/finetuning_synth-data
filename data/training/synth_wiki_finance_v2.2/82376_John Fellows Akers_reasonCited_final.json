[S2] He was president (1983\u20131989), chief executive officer (1985\u20131993) and chairman (1986\u20131993) of IBM.

[S9] In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker's assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. [S10] Akers was chief executive during IBM's decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. [S11] Apple Inc. [S12] founder Steve Jobs described Akers as \"*smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn\u2019t know anything about product.*\u201d\n\nAkers was credited with simplifying the company's bureaucracy to focus more on profits. [S13] On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design, and manufacturing. [S14] The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with the competition and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. [S15] Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. [S16] Akers' vision was to autonomize each division into \"Baby Blues\" with the aim of spinning them off from \"Big Blue\". [S17] Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM's workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. [S18] The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis. [S19] Akers also closed ten plants and trimmed manufacturing capacity by forty percent. [S20] ### Retirement\n\nOn Tuesday, January 26, 1993, Akers was forced to announce his resignation, after several months of IBM insisting that it had full confidence in his leadership. [S21] The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss. [S22] The dividend was also slashed from $1.21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters. [S23] IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice-chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. [S24] Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. [S25] Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. [S26] Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. [S27] He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM's history to attain the position from outside the company.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that led to John Fellows Akers' resignation as CEO of IBM and the broader organizational challenges beyond his leadership. I need to look through the provided passage and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the passage for mentions of his resignation. Sentence S21 says he was forced to announce his resignation after IBM insisted they had confidence in him. Then S22 mentions a $5 billion annual loss, which is a big factor. S23 talks about the dividend being slashed, which probably affected investor confidence. \n\nLooking at the context around his leadership, S11 states he was CEO during IBM's decline in the mid-80s and early 90s. There's also S33 which says the company's difficulties weren't just his fault; it was an outdated IBM system and a complacent board. That's important for the broader challenges. \n\nOther points: S18 mentions downsizing, S19 talks about the morale crisis due to layoffs, and S20 about closing plants. These could be part of the organizational issues. Also, S32 mentions dissatisfaction from the board and banks, indicating systemic problems. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the resignation factors include the $5B loss, dividend cut, and board dissatisfaction. The broader challenges include the outdated system and board complacency. I should structure the answer with each factor in separate statements and cite the relevant sentences."

The user is asking about how Akers' restructuring efforts at IBM aimed to address the company's decline and the key components of his strategy to decentralize operations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that Akers became CEO during IBM's decline in the mid-80s to early 90s. The key part about his restructuring is in sentences S14 to S17. \n\nIn S14, it says he created five new autonomous organizations to handle innovation, design, and manufacturing. That's a major point. Then S15 explains that the goal was to decentralize the company, which was seen as bloated. They wanted to give more responsibility to younger managers and reduce the role of the headquarters. \n\nS17 mentions the \"Baby Blues\" idea, aiming to spin off divisions from \"Big Blue.\" Also, S13 talks about simplifying bureaucracy to focus on profits. The downsizing and closing plants are mentioned in S18 and S20, but those might be part of the broader strategy. \n\nI need to make sure I connect these points. The answer should mention decentralizing by creating autonomous units, reducing bureaucracy, empowering younger managers, and possibly the spin-off strategy. Citations would be S14, S15, S17, and maybe S13. Wait, the question specifically asks about decentralizing operations, so the key components are the autonomous organizations, giving more responsibility, reducing headquarters' role, and the Baby Blues concept. \n\nI should structure the answer into two parts: how the efforts addressed the decline (by decentralizing, simplifying, etc.) and the key components (the five organizations, autonomy, younger managers, spinning off divisions). Check the sentences again to ensure correct citations. Also, make sure each statement has the right citations. Let me verify each part."

[S2] He was president (1983\u20131989), chief executive officer (1985\u20131993) and chairman (1986\u20131993) of IBM.

[S9] In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker's assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. [S10] Akers was chief executive during IBM's decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. [S11] Apple Inc. [S12] founder Steve Jobs described Akers as \"*smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn\u2019t know anything about product.*\u201d\n\nAkers was credited with simplifying the company's bureaucracy to focus more on profits. [S13] On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design, and manufacturing. [S14] The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with the competition and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. [S15] Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. [S16] Akers' vision was to autonomize each division into \"Baby Blues\" with the aim of spinning them off from \"Big Blue\". [S17] Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM's workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. [S18] The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis.

[S21] The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss. [S22] The dividend was also slashed from $1.21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters.

[S24] Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about contradictions in Akers' leadership style and external perceptions of his capabilities, and how that affected IBM's trajectory.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of contradictions. The passage mentions that Akers was credited with simplifying bureaucracy and focusing on profits, which sounds positive. But there's also a part where Steve Jobs called him a great salesperson but lacking in product knowledge. That's a contradiction between his sales skills and product expertise.\n\nAnother point is the restructuring efforts. Akers tried to decentralize IBM, creating autonomous divisions, but this led to a morale crisis due to layoffs and plant closures. So, his strategy to streamline might have conflicting outcomes\u2014improving efficiency but harming employee morale.\n\nAlso, the passage states that despite his efforts, IBM faced a $5 billion loss and had to cut dividends. This suggests that his leadership didn't prevent financial struggles, which might contrast with the expectation of a successful leader. Additionally, the context mentions that some blamed the \"IBM system\" and a complacent board, implying that Akers might have been following existing structures rather than driving change, which could be another contradiction.\n\nFor citations, the Steve Jobs quote is in S12. The restructuring and its effects are in S14-S17, S18-S20. The financial losses are in S22, S23. The mention of the \"IBM system\" and board's role is in S33. Also, the part about him being forced to resign is S21, which ties into the impact on IBM's trajectory.\n\nI need to structure these points into statements with proper citations. Make sure each statement is concise and the citations are correctly placed. Check if all relevant parts are covered and that the contradictions are clearly highlighted."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Akers' role in IBM's shift from lifetime employment to workforce reductions and how that affected company morale.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences numbered from S1 to S35. Let me scan through them to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with S1, it mentions John Fellows Akers and his positions at IBM. S2 says he was president, CEO, and chairman. Then in S8, it states he became CEO in 1985. S10 mentions he was CEO during IBM's decline in the mid-80s and early 90s. \n\nLooking for the shift from lifetime employment: S19 says IBM had a lifetime employment policy but then there were voluntary buyouts and the first layoff in 1993, causing a morale crisis. Also, S18 mentions downsizing from 407k to 360k by 1991. \n\nAkers' actions: S14 talks about restructuring, creating autonomous organizations, which led to employees switching jobs. S15 explains the decentralization and reducing Armonk's role. S17 mentions \"Baby Blues\" and spinning off divisions. S18 is the workforce reduction. \n\nEffect on morale: S19 directly mentions the morale crisis due to layoffs and buyouts. \n\nSo, putting it together: Akers initiated workforce reductions (downsizing, layoff) and restructuring, which led to a morale crisis. The citations would be S18, S19, and maybe S14/S15 for the restructuring steps. But the question specifically asks about the shift from lifetime employment to reductions. The lifetime employment policy is mentioned in S19, and the downsizing in S18. The morale effect is in S19. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. The answer should state that Akers led the shift by implementing downsizing and restructuring, leading to a morale crisis. The citations would be S18 and S19. Also, maybe S14 and S15 for the restructuring steps. But the user might want the most direct citations. Let me check the exact sentences.\n\nThe user's question has two parts: Akers' role in the shift and the effect on morale. The shift is covered in S18 (downsizing) and S19 (lifetime policy to layoffs). The effect on morale is in S19. So the answer would be:\n\nAkers played a key role in IBM's shift from lifetime employment to workforce reductions by implementing a major downsizing, cutting the workforce from 407,000 to 360,000 by 1991, and restructuring the company into autonomous divisions. This led to a morale crisis due to voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in 1993. \n\nCitations: S18 and S19. Also, maybe S14 and S15 for the restructuring, but the question is about the shift from lifetime employment, which is directly in S19. The downsizing is in S18. So the answer should cite those two."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the succession plan for IBM's leadership after Akers' resignation reflected internal power dynamics and the role of external figures.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me scan through the sentences. \n\nStarting with Akers' resignation: [S21] mentions he was forced to announce his resignation after IBM's $5 billion loss. [S22] and [S23] talk about the financial issues. Then [S24] mentions Jack Kuehler becoming vice-chairman and Frank Metz being ousted. [S25] says Paul Rizzo, a rival, was restored as vice-chairman and finance director. This suggests internal power shifts, maybe conflicts between different factions. \n\nNext, [S26] states that Akers remained as CEO for three months while a committee chose a successor, speculated to be an outsider. Then [S27] says he was succeeded by Gerstner, who was external. [S28] mentions Gerstner was the first CEO from outside. \n\nLooking at [S29], it says the management coup was organized by Jim Burke, a longtime director, who arranged meetings between Rizzo and Louis Gerstner. This indicates that external figures (Gerstner) were involved, and internal figures like Burke and Rizzo played roles. \n\nAlso, [S32] mentions that some entities dissatisfied with losing power on the board, including past CEOs like John Opel and Frank Cary, and banks that were major shareholders. This points to internal power dynamics where previous leaders and shareholders had influence. \n\nSo, the succession plan involved internal power struggles, with figures like Rizzo and Burke, and external figures like Gerstner. The mention of the board's dissatisfaction and the involvement of outsiders in the succession reflects both internal dynamics and external roles. \n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Check if all the key points are covered: internal power dynamics (rivalries, board dissatisfaction, role of Rizzo and Burke) and external figures (Gerstner, possibly the banks)."

    "[S1] John Fellows Akers\n\n\n# John Fellows Akers\n\n\n\n**John Fellows Akers** (December 28, 1934 \u2013 August 22, 2014) was an American businessman. [S2] He was president (1983\u20131989), chief executive officer (1985\u20131993) and chairman (1986\u20131993) of IBM. [S3] ## Education\n\nAkers attended Yale, and while there joined Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). [S4] ## IBM\n\nAkers joined IBM in 1960 after serving in the Navy as a jet pilot. [S5] Akers said in 2010 \u201cWe were very square. [S6] We wore the blue suits, white shirts with button-down collars, striped ties, fedoras and wingtip shoes. [S7] The customers felt they could count on us.\u201d\n\nAkers became CEO in 1985. [S8] He benefitted from the support of one of his predecessors, Frank Cary. [S9] In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker's assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. [S10] Akers was chief executive during IBM's decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. [S11] Apple Inc. [S12] founder Steve Jobs described Akers as \"*smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn\u2019t know anything about product.*\u201d\n\nAkers was credited with simplifying the company's bureaucracy to focus more on profits. [S13] On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design, and manufacturing. [S14] The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with the competition and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. [S15] Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. [S16] Akers' vision was to autonomize each division into \"Baby Blues\" with the aim of spinning them off from \"Big Blue\". [S17] Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM's workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. [S18] The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis. [S19] Akers also closed ten plants and trimmed manufacturing capacity by forty percent. [S20] ### Retirement\n\nOn Tuesday, January 26, 1993, Akers was forced to announce his resignation, after several months of IBM insisting that it had full confidence in his leadership. [S21] The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss. [S22] The dividend was also slashed from $1.21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters. [S23] IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice-chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. [S24] Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. [S25] Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. [S26] Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. [S27] He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM's history to attain the position from outside the company. [S28] The management coup was mounted by longtime IBM director Jim Burke, who organized secret meetings between Rizzo and outsider Louis V. [S29] Gerstner, Jr. [S30] to examine the company's problems. [S31] It was also speculated that several entities were dissatisfied with losing their power on the board of directors and the declining stock price, including the banks which were once IBM's largest shareholders, as well as Aker's predecessors as CEO, John Opel and Frank Cary. [S32] The company's difficulties weren't caused by Akers alone, as some suggested that he was merely doing what he had been \"programmed\" to do by an outdated \"IBM system\", while a complacent board of directors was also blamed. [S33] ## Other business roles",
    "[S34] Akers was on the board of directors of Lehman Brothers when it filed for bankruptcy. [S35] ## Personal\n\nAkers died of a stroke at age 79 in Boston, Massachusetts on August 22, 2014."
