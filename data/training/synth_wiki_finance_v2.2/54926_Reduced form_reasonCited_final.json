      "answer": "<statement>The parameter identification problem arises in structural models because the structural equations cannot be uniquely determined from data due to interdependencies and lack of restrictions. In contrast, reduced form equations are identifiable because they express endogenous variables directly as functions of exogenous variables, allowing straightforward estimation from empirical data.<cite>[S13][S14][S21]</cite></statement><statement>Structural form models represent theoretical relationships, such as supply and demand equations, where parameters like structural coefficients (e.g., demand or supply parameters) cannot be isolated without additional restrictions. For example, the reduced form equations derived from solving structural equations (e.g., price and quantity as functions of exogenous variables) can be estimated empirically, but structural parameters require external information, such as an exogenous variable unique to one equation (e.g., a supply-side exogenous variable not in the demand equation).<cite>[S13][S14][S21]</cite></statement><statement>Reduced form equations are identifiable because each equation in the reduced form contains a single endogenous variable, making their coefficients estimable from data. For instance, in the general linear case, the reduced form matrix \u03a0 can be directly estimated, whereas the structural matrices A and B remain unidentified without restrictions, as their parameters are conflated in the structural equations.<cite>[S21][S19]</cite></statement>",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants an explanation of the parameter identification problem in structural and reduced form models, and why reduced form equations are identifiable while structural ones aren't. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what structural and reduced form models are. From the passage, the structural form is the original theoretical model, like the supply and demand equations. The reduced form is obtained by solving these equations for the endogenous variables, making them functions of exogenous variables.\n\nThe key point here is identification. The passage mentions that in the structural form, parameters can't be identified because there are multiple ways to write the equations. For example, in the supply and demand model, the reduced form equations can be estimated from data, but the structural parameters (like those in the demand equation) can't be uniquely determined without additional information. \n\nLooking at the supporting context, S13 says that even after estimating the reduced form, you can't identify the demand equation's structural parameters. S14 mentions needing an exogenous variable in the supply equation but not in demand. Also, S21 states that without restrictions on A and B matrices, structural coefficients can't be identified. \n\nThe reduced form equations are identifiable because each equation in the reduced form has one endogenous variable, making them estimable from data. The passage says in S21 that the M reduced form equations can be identified because each has only one endogenous variable. \n\nSo, putting it together: Structural equations aren't identifiable because their parameters are intertwined and require restrictions, while reduced forms are identifiable as they directly relate endogenous to exogenous variables without such interdependencies. Citations would be S13, S14, S21, and maybe S1 for reduced form definition."
