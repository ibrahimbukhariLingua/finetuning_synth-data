[S4] Bennett***, 564 U.S. [S5] 721 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. [S6] ## Facts\n\nIn 1998, Arizona voters approved the ballot measure known as the Clean Elections Act. [S7] When it was passed, the Clean Elections law established public financing for candidates running for office. [S8] Candidates who choose to participate in the system must collect a specific number of five dollar donations. [S9] Under the law as passed, if a participating candidate is outspent by a non-participating opponent (including the opponent's expenditures of personal funds) the participating candidate receives government funds matching the money spent by the non-participating candidate, up to three times the original government subsidy. [S10] Independent expenditures by groups not coordinated with the candidate were also matched. [S11] ## Legal history\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a legal challenge against the Arizona Clean Elections Commission on August 21, 2008, in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. [S12] According to the Plaintiffs, the Clean Elections system produced a chilling effect on speech because it \"seeks to equalize funding.\" But advocates of the Clean Elections law argued that the system deters corruption because candidates do not have to cater to special interest groups. [S13] In January 2010 the district court decided the matching funds provision violated the First Amendment and issued an injunction. [S14] District Court Judge Roslyn Silver agreed with the plaintiffs that the matching funds provision could not stand under Davis, although she referred to the result as \"illogical\" and referred to the holding in *Davis* as \"an ipse dixit unsupported by the slightest veneer of reasoning to hide the obvious judicial fiat by which it is reached.\"\n\nSilver suspended her order while the Arizona Clean Elections Commission appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. [S15] The case was heard by the Ninth Circuit Court on April 12, 2010. [S16] The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the matching funds provision of Arizona's law was analytically distinct from the millionaire's amendment. [S17] Two years earlier the Supreme Court had decided, in *Davis v. [S18] Federal Election Commission* (2008), to strike down a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) known as the Millionaire's Amendment that allowed candidates to raise campaign contributions at three times the normal contribution limit and receive unlimited coordinated party expenditures if their opponent spent over $350,000 of their own personal money. [S19] Writing for the Court in *Davis*, Justice Samuel Alito said the burden the Millionaire's Amendment imposed on candidates was impermissible because \"it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice\". [S20] In other words, the statute imposed a burden on candidates who did not limit expenditures of their personal wealth to $350,000. [S21] The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of *McComish*. [S22] (This case was consolidated with *Arizona Free Enterprise Club Freedom Club PAC v. [S23] Bennett* prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.) Oral arguments were heard March 28, 2011. [S24] On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling and declared matching funds schemes designed to \"level the playing field\" unconstitutional in a 5\u20134 decision.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the procedural steps the plaintiffs took to challenge the Clean Elections Act and how the timeline of appeals led to the Supreme Court's intervention.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Passage 1 has a lot of numbered sentences, and Passage 2 also has some. The user wants the answer with citations from the sentences in the passage.\n\nLooking at the question, the first part is about the procedural steps the plaintiffs took. From Passage 2, sentence [S12] mentions that the plaintiffs filed a legal challenge on August 21, 2008, in the US District Court. Then, in Passage 1, there's a section under \"Case timeline\" that starts with August 21, 2008: Case filed in U.S. District Court. So that's the first step. \n\nNext, the plaintiffs filed a preliminary injunction on January 5, 2010, asking Judge Roslyn O. Silver to stop the issuance of matching funds for the 2010 election (sentence [S36] and [S37]). Then, there's a hearing on motions for summary judgment on January 15, 2010. \n\nJudge Silver struck down the Clean Elections as unconstitutional on January 20, 2010, but with a stay. The plaintiffs then asked the 9th Circuit to remove the stay, but it was refused (sentence [S39] to [S41]). Then they filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, which was also refused (sentence [S42] and [S43]). \n\nAfter the 9th Circuit ruled in favor of the state on May 21, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to vacate the stay with the Supreme Court (sentence [S45]). The Supreme Court refused it initially but later blocked the distribution in June 2010 (sentence [S48]). Then they made a formal appeal to the Supreme Court in August 2010 (sentence [S49]), and the Supreme Court agreed to consider it in November 2010 (sentence [S50]). Oral arguments were in March 2011, and the decision was in June 2011.\n\nSo the procedural steps include filing the initial case, seeking a preliminary injunction, appealing to the 9th Circuit, emergency appeals to the Supreme Court, and finally the formal appeal leading to the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nNow, the timeline leading to the Supreme Court's intervention: after the district court's decision, the state appealed to the 9th Circuit, which upheld the law. The plaintiffs then tried to get the stay lifted, but the Supreme Court initially refused. However, after the 9th Circuit's decision, the plaintiffs continued to appeal, leading the Supreme Court to take the case. The key points here are the initial filing, the district court's ruling, the 9th Circuit's reversal, and the subsequent Supreme Court interventions.\n\nI need to make sure each statement in the answer is properly cited. For example, the initial filing is [S12] and [S26] (but wait, [S26] is about the Court's finding, not the plaintiffs' steps). Wait, the initial filing is in Passage 1, [S26] is part of the analysis, but the actual filing is in Passage 1's case timeline: [S26] is part of the analysis, but the case timeline starts with [S32] which says \"Case filed in U.S. District Court.\" So [S32] is the correct citation for the initial filing. Then the preliminary injunction is [S36] and [S37]. The district court's decision is [S39]. The 9th Circuit's ruling is [S44]. The Supreme Court's intervention steps are [S42], [S45], [S48], [S49], [S50], [S51].\n\nWait, the user's supporting context has Passage 1 and Passage 2. The case timeline is in Passage 1, so the sentences there are [S32] to [S51]. Passage 2 has [S1] to [S25]. So the citations need to be from the correct passage. For example, the initial filing is [S32], the preliminary injunction is [S36] and [S37], the district court's decision is [S39], the 9th Circuit's ruling is [S44], the emergency appeals to SC are [S42], [S45], [S48], etc.\n\nSo the answer should list each procedural step with the correct citations. Also, the timeline leading to SC intervention would include the 9th Circuit's decision, the subsequent appeals, and the SC's acceptance of the case."

[S8] Candidates who choose to participate in the system must collect a specific number of five dollar donations. [S9] Under the law as passed, if a participating candidate is outspent by a non-participating opponent (including the opponent's expenditures of personal funds) the participating candidate receives government funds matching the money spent by the non-participating candidate, up to three times the original government subsidy. [S10] Independent expenditures by groups not coordinated with the candidate were also matched. [S11] ## Legal history\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a legal challenge against the Arizona Clean Elections Commission on August 21, 2008, in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. [S12] According to the Plaintiffs, the Clean Elections system produced a chilling effect on speech because it \"seeks to equalize funding.\" But advocates of the Clean Elections law argued that the system deters corruption because candidates do not have to cater to special interest groups. [S13] In January 2010 the district court decided the matching funds provision violated the First Amendment and issued an injunction. [S14] District Court Judge Roslyn Silver agreed with the plaintiffs that the matching funds provision could not stand under Davis, although she referred to the result as \"illogical\" and referred to the holding in *Davis* as \"an ipse dixit unsupported by the slightest veneer of reasoning to hide the obvious judicial fiat by which it is reached.\"\n\nSilver suspended her order while the Arizona Clean Elections Commission appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. [S15] The case was heard by the Ninth Circuit Court on April 12, 2010. [S16] The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the matching funds provision of Arizona's law was analytically distinct from the millionaire's amendment. [S17] Two years earlier the Supreme Court had decided, in *Davis v. [S18] Federal Election Commission* (2008), to strike down a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) known as the Millionaire's Amendment that allowed candidates to raise campaign contributions at three times the normal contribution limit and receive unlimited coordinated party expenditures if their opponent spent over $350,000 of their own personal money. [S19] Writing for the Court in *Davis*, Justice Samuel Alito said the burden the Millionaire's Amendment imposed on candidates was impermissible because \"it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice\". [S20] In other words, the statute imposed a burden on candidates who did not limit expenditures of their personal wealth to $350,000. [S21] The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of *McComish*. [S22] (This case was consolidated with *Arizona Free Enterprise Club Freedom Club PAC v. [S23] Bennett* prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.) Oral arguments were heard March 28, 2011. [S24] On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling and declared matching funds schemes designed to \"level the playing field\" unconstitutional in a 5\u20134 decision.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking why the district court described the Davis ruling as 'an ipse dixit unsupported by the slightest veneer of reasoning,' and how this critique relates to the Clean Elections Act's matching funds provision.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant parts of the supporting context. The passage mentions the district court's statement about the Davis ruling. Looking through the text, in Passage 2, there's a sentence that says: \"District Court Judge Roslyn Silver agreed with the plaintiffs that the matching funds provision could not stand under Davis, although she referred to the result as 'illogical' and referred to the holding in *Davis* as 'an ipse dixit unsupported by the slightest veneer of reasoning to hide the obvious judicial fiat by which it is reached.'\" That's from [S14].\n\nSo the district court's critique of Davis was that it was an \"ipse dixit\" (a self-evident truth without reasoning) and lacked proper reasoning. The reason for this critique relates to how the Davis ruling was applied to the Clean Elections Act's matching funds. The district court thought that applying Davis to the matching funds provision was illogical because Davis was about the Millionaire's Amendment, which is different from the Clean Elections Act's structure. \n\nIn the supporting context, there's a comparison between the Clean Elections Act and the Millionaire's Amendment. For example, [S26] states that the Clean Elections Act imposed a heavier burden on candidate speech than the Millionaire's Amendment because candidates received public funds automatically when opponents spent money, even for independent groups. [S27] mentions that in Davis, candidates still had to raise money from supporters, not getting automatic funds. The district court likely thought that the Davis decision didn't adequately address the differences between the two systems, leading to the critique about lack of reasoning.\n\nSo the answer should connect the district court's citation of Davis as lacking reasoning to the specific differences in how the matching funds provision worked compared to the Millionaire's Amendment. The citations would be [S14] for the critique and [S26][S27] for the comparison with Davis."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the Clean Elections Act's automatic public funding mechanism and how it differed from the contribution limits in Davis v. FEC.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections, Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me scan through them again.\n\nIn Passage 1, there are several sentences. Sentence S26 mentions that the Clean Elections Act imposed a heavier burden on candidate speech than the Millionaire's Amendment because candidates received public funds automatically when their opponent spent money, even from independent groups. S27 says that in Davis, candidates still had to raise money from supporters, not getting automatic funds. S28 adds that they didn't receive public funds automatically based on opponents' expenditures. S29 talks about independent expenditures being protected since Buckley v. Valeo, and the Clean Elections Act burdened groups by forcing them to choose between issues or candidates or triggering matching funds. \n\nIn Passage 2, S7 mentions the Clean Elections law established public financing. S8 says candidates must collect donations, and S9 explains that if a participating candidate is outspent by a non-participating opponent, they get matching funds up to three times the subsidy. S10 notes that independent expenditures by groups were also matched. Then, in the Legal history section, S14 mentions the district court found matching funds violated the First Amendment. S17 says the Ninth Circuit held the matching funds were different from the millionaire's amendment. S18-21 discuss Davis v. FEC, where the Millionaire's Amendment was struck down because it burdened candidates who didn't limit their personal spending. \n\nSo, the significance of the Clean Elections Act's automatic funding is that it provided public funds automatically when opponents spent money, which the Court found burdensome. In Davis, the contribution limits were about candidates raising more money if their opponent spent over a certain amount, but they had to actively raise it, not get it automatically. \n\nThe key differences are that Clean Elections gave automatic funds based on opponent's spending, while Davis allowed higher limits but required candidates to raise the money themselves. Also, the Clean Elections affected independent expenditures, whereas Davis was about contribution limits.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. The first part about the significance would cite S26, S27, S28. The difference from Davis would cite S26, S27, S28, S18-S21. Wait, need to check which sentences specifically mention Davis. S18-21 talk about Davis, so those would be relevant. Also, S26 mentions the comparison to the Millionaire's Amendment, which is part of Davis. \n\nSo, the first statement about the significance: \"The Clean Elections Act's automatic public funding mechanism provided candidates with government funds matching their opponent's expenditures, even for independent groups, which the Court found imposed a heavier burden on candidate speech compared to the Millionaire's Amendment.\" Citations would be S26, S27, S28. \n\nThen, the difference from Davis: \"In *Davis v. Federal Election Commission*, contribution limits allowed candidates to raise funds at three times the normal limit if their opponent spent over $350,000, but they still had to actively raise money from supporters, unlike the Clean Elections Act's automatic funding based on opponents' expenditures.\" Citations here would be S27, S28, S18-S21. Wait, S18 is part of the Davis case, but the exact details are in S19-S21. So maybe S19, S20, S21. \n\nBut the user's question is about how it differed from the contribution limits in Davis. The Davis case's contribution limits were part of the Millionaire's Amendment, which was struck down. The Clean Elections Act's automatic funding was different because it didn't require candidates to raise money themselves. So the key point is that in Davis, candidates had to raise money, while Clean Elections gave it automatically. \n\nSo the second statement would be: \"The Clean Elections Act differed from the contribution limits in *Davis v. Federal Election Commission* by automatically providing public funds to candidates based on opponents' expenditures, whereas in *Davis*, candidates had to actively raise money from supporters to benefit from increased contribution limits.\" Citations would be S26, S27, S28, S19, S20, S21. \n\nI need to make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S9 and S10 in Passage 2 describe the mechanism, but maybe they are not needed if the key points are covered in the other sentences. \n\nSo final answer would have two statements. The first explaining the significance with citations from S26, S27, S28. The second explaining the difference with citations from S26, S27, S28, S19, S20, S21. But need to check if S19-S21 are part of the supporting context. Yes, in Passage 2, S18-21 mention Davis. So those are valid citations."
