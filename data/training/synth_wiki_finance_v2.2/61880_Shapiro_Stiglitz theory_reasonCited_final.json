      "answer": "<statement>The inverse marginal cost (zi = \u03c6i/Wi) in the Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz model's trade liberalization framework serves as a performance indicator reflecting a firm's productivity (\u03c6i) relative to its wage (Wi). This measure is introduced to capture the relationship between firm-specific productivity and wages, which influences competitive dynamics in the market. In the context of trade liberalization, the inverse marginal cost affects firm entry decisions by determining the cutoff productivity level (z*) required for firms to enter the market. The Zero Cutoff Productivity (ZCP) condition and Free Entry (FE) condition, which depend on zi, establish the equilibrium threshold for entry. Firms with higher zi (indicating higher productivity relative to wages) are more likely to meet the profitability criteria for entry, while lower zi may deter entry due to reduced competitiveness.<cite>[S60]</cite></statement>",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the inverse marginal cost (zi = \u03c6i/Wi) in the Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz model's trade liberalization framework. The user wants to know its role and how it affects firm entry decisions. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions the inverse marginal cost in sentence S60. Let me check that part again. It says, \"Here productivity and firm-specific wage are seen as performance indicators of a firm, and the inverse marginal cost zi = \u03c6i/Wi for company i is introduced to reflect them.\" So, the inverse marginal cost is a measure that combines productivity (\u03c6i) and wage (Wi), acting as a performance indicator.\n\nNow, the question is about its role in the trade liberalization framework. The passage also talks about the Zero cutoff productivity (ZCP) condition and Free Entry (FE) condition in sentences S54 to S60. The ZCP condition is r(z*)/\u03c3 - f = 0, and FE is \u03c0(z*) = \u03b4fe/(1 - G(z*)). These conditions determine the equilibrium marginal entrant z*. \n\nSince zi is part of the model, I need to connect it to how firm entry decisions are made. The inverse marginal cost likely affects the cutoff productivity level z*. If a firm's zi is higher (meaning higher productivity relative to its wage), it might be more likely to enter the market. The FE condition implies that firms enter until their expected profits equal the cost of entry. So, if zi affects the profitability, it would influence entry decisions.\n\nLooking at the equations, the price rule is p(i) = Wi/(\u03c1\u03c6i), which rearranges to zi = \u03c6i/Wi. So, lower zi (lower productivity relative to wage) would mean higher prices, possibly affecting the firm's ability to compete. In a trade liberalization context, where markets might become more open, firms with higher zi (better performance) might be more competitive, affecting who enters the market.\n\nThe passage doesn't explicitly state how zi affects entry decisions, but based on the ZCP and FE conditions, zi would influence the cutoff productivity. Firms with higher zi (better productivity/wage ratio) would meet the entry conditions, leading to entry. Conversely, lower zi might prevent entry. So the inverse marginal cost acts as a threshold determinant for entry.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The definition of zi is in S60. The ZCP and FE conditions are in S54 to S60, but the exact sentences might be S54 (mentioning Davis and Harrigan's work), S59 (price rule), and S60 (definition of zi). The ZCP condition is in S54? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe passage says: \"Zero cutoff productivity (ZCP) condition r(z*)/\u03c3 - f = 0 and Free Entry (FE) condition \u03c0(z*) = \u03b4fe/(1 - G(z*)) allow us to determine the equilibrium marginal entrant z*...\" That's in the context of the model. So the ZCP and FE conditions are part of the framework. The exact sentence numbers for these conditions might be S54? Wait, the passage starts with \"Davis and Harrigan consider...\" in S54, then the equations follow. The ZCP and FE conditions are mentioned in the same paragraph as S54? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the passage:\n\n\" Davis and Harrigan consider the effects of trade liberalization on firms and workers, merging the variant of the Shapiro-Stiglitz model of efficiency wages and the Melitz model. [S54] A CES utility function and an aggregate price are represented by [...] [S55] [...] [S56] Then we have the revenue for the producer [...] [S57] The price is given by [...] [S58] We also have the price rule [...] [S59] Here productivity and firm-specific wage are seen as performance indicators of a firm, and the inverse marginal cost [...] [S60] Zero cutoff productivity (ZCP) condition [...] and Free Entry (FE) condition [...] allow us to determine the equilibrium marginal entrant [...]\"\n\nSo the ZCP and FE conditions are part of the same paragraph as S54? Or are they in separate sentences? The exact sentences would be S54 (the first part about Davis and Harrigan), then S55-S59, and S60. The ZCP and FE conditions are mentioned in the same sentence as S60? Let me check the original passage:\n\nThe exact text is: \"Zero cutoff productivity (ZCP) condition r(z^{\\*})/\\sigma -f=0 and Free Entry (FE) condition {\\tilde {\\pi }}(z^{\\*})={\\frac {\\delta f\\_{e}}{1-G(z^{\\*})}} allow us to determine the equilibrium marginal entrant {\\displaystyle z^{\\*}}, where {\\displaystyle G(z)=Pr[Z\\leq z]} is the cumulative distribution function.\"\n\nThis is in the same paragraph as the price rule (S59) and the definition of zi (S60). So the ZCP and FE conditions are part of the same sentence as S60? Or is that a separate sentence? The original passage's structure isn't clear, but based on the numbering, S60 is the sentence where zi is defined, and the ZCP and FE conditions are mentioned in the same sentence. So the ZCP and FE conditions are in S60? Or is there a separate sentence?\n\nAssuming that the ZCP and FE conditions are in S60, then the answer would cite S60 for the definition of zi and the conditions. However, if they are in a separate sentence, maybe S54 or another. But given the provided context, the exact sentence numbers might be S60 for the definition and the conditions. Alternatively, the ZCP and FE conditions might be in a different sentence. But since the user provided the passage with [S54] to [S60], and the ZCP and FE are mentioned in the same paragraph as S59 and S60, perhaps they are in S60. \n\nIn any case, the key points are that zi is defined in S60, and the ZCP and FE conditions are part of the framework that determine entry. Therefore, the role of zi is as a performance indicator affecting the cutoff productivity, and thus firm entry decisions. The citations would be S60 for the definition and the conditions."

    "[S1] Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz theory\n\n\n# Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz theory\n\n\n\nIn labour economics, **Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz theory** of efficiency wages (or **Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz efficiency wage model**) is an economic theory of wages and unemployment in labour market equilibrium. [S2] It provides a technical description of why wages are unlikely to fall and how involuntary unemployment appears. [S3] This theory was first developed by Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz. [S4] ## Introduction\n\nWhen full employment is achieved, if a worker is sacked, he automatically finds his next job soon. [S5] In the circumstances, he does not need to exert his effort in his job, and thus full employment necessarily motivates a worker to shirk provided that he is happy with loafing on the job. [S6] Since shirking makes a firm's productivity decline, the firm needs to offer its workers higher wages to eliminate shirking. [S7] Then all firms try to eliminate shirking, which pushes up average wages and decreases employment. [S8] Hence nominal wages tend to display downward rigidity. [S9] In equilibrium, all firms pay the same wage above market clearing, and unemployment makes job loss costly, and so unemployment serves as a worker-discipline device. [S10] A jobless person cannot convince an employer that he works at a wage lower than the equilibrium wage, because the owner worries that shirking occurs after he is hired. [S11] As a result, his unemployment becomes involuntary. [S12] ## No-shirking condition\n\nSuppose utility is a function of wages w and effort e like {\\displaystyle u(w,e)=w-e}, and workers maximize the utility function with a discount rate r. [S13] Then let b be the probability per unit time that a worker is dismissed from his job, and now we introduce the expected lifetime utility {\\displaystyle V\\_{u}} of an unemployed individual. [S14] Then we find the asset value of employment during a short interval [0, T]\n\nbecause the worker is either dismissed or kept employed during the time. [S15] The exponential function appears, because the occasion of dismiss in the interval is once and Poisson distribution is used for the discount rate. [S16] Due to the short interval, we approximate the exponential function by 1-rT\n\nand simple calculation yields\n\nThen we find the fundamental asset equation of a worker:\n\nFor a nonshirker the equation is\n\nand for a shirker\n\nwhere q is the probability per unit time that a worker is caught shirking and sacked. [S17] Then we see\n\nThe condition {\\displaystyle V\\_{e,S}<V\\_{e,N}} is called the no-shirking condition (NSC), which is expressed as\n\nwhere {\\displaystyle {\\hat {w}}} is the critical wage. [S18] The worker works hard if and only if the NSC is satisfied. [S19] Thus if workers get sufficiently high wages, then the NSC is met and they will not shirk. [S20] The condition tells us that\n\n* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the workers exert more effort. [S21] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the expected lifetime utility of an unemployed individual increases. [S22] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the probability of being detected shirking decreases. [S23] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the discount rate increases. [S24] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the exogenous separation rate increases. [S25] ## Market equilibrium\n\nLet {\\displaystyle a} be the probability of getting a job per unit time. [S26] In equilibrium, the flow into the unemployment pool must be equal to the flow out. [S27] Thus the probability is\n\nwhere {\\displaystyle L} is the aggregate employment and {\\displaystyle N} is the total labour supply. [S28] In reality, an employee is offered his minimum wage {\\displaystyle {\\overline {w}}} or its equivalent by law. [S29] Thus the NSC becomes\n\nand we call it the aggregate NSC. [S30] These two yields\n\nwhere the unemployment rate is {\\displaystyle u={\\frac {N-L}{N}}}. [S31] This constraint suggests that full employment always should involve shirking. [S32] The aggregate production function {\\displaystyle F(L)} is a function of total effective labour force.",
    "[S33] A firm's labour demand is given by equating the cost of hiring an additional employee to the marginal product of labour. [S34] This cost consists of wages and future unemployment benefits. [S35] Now consider the case where {\\displaystyle {\\overline {w}}=0} , then we have\n\nIn equilibrium, {\\displaystyle F'(L)={\\hat {w}}=w^{\\*}} holds, where {\\displaystyle w^{\\*}} is the equilibrium wage. [S36] Then the equilibrium condition becomes\n\nThis suggests following things. [S37] * Demand-side approach: If the employer pays less than {\\displaystyle w^{\\*}}, worker's shirking becomes likely to occur (which decreases their productivity). [S38] Consequently, the wage is unlikely to decrease, and this is a microscopic mechanism of nominal rigidity. [S39] Thus, wage cannot decrease so that it can stabilize employment level, and so unemployment must increase during recession. [S40] * Supply-side approach: Jobless persons want to work at {\\displaystyle w^{\\*}} or lower, but cannot make a credible promise not to shirk at such wages. [S41] As a result, involuntary unemployment occurs. [S42] ## Job security rules\n\nThe level of employment is changed by rules about job security. [S43] Consider a firm which consists of an employer and homogeneous employees. [S44] Then, suppose the profit of the firm is a function of the level of employment N, the lowest wage {\\displaystyle W={\\frac {L}{p}}} and the level of monitoring M chosen by the employer. [S45] where g(N) is the production function, L is the value of on-the-job leisure from shirking, and p is the probability that an employee is caught shirking and sacked. [S46] Assume that the production function has the upper limit and its second derivative with respect to N is negative. [S47] Not to mention, the first derivative is positive. [S48] That is a reasonable assumption that the function has its upper bound in term of productivity. [S49] Consider, for instance, such a function of time as\n\nObviously its first derivative is positive, and second derivative is negative. [S50] Let R be a measure of the difficulty of dismissing an employee who is caught shirking. [S51] Then p is a function of both R and M. [S52] The first and second derivatives of the profit with regard to N are:\n\nThe condition for the maximum of the profit is {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial \\pi }{\\partial N}}=0}, and so we have\n\nThus differentiating its both sides with regard to R gives us\n\nIt turns out that {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial N}{\\partial R}}} is negative, which means that the more difficult to sack a shirker the lower employment level. [S53] ## Trade liberalization\n\nDavis and Harrigan consider the effects of trade liberalization on firms and workers,\nmerging the variant of the Shapiro-Stiglitz model of efficiency wages and the Melitz model. [S54] A CES utility function and an aggregate price are represented by\n{\\displaystyle V=[\\int q(i)^{\\rho }di]^{1/\\rho },P=[\\int p(i)^{1-\\sigma }di]^{1/(1-\\sigma )}} respectively,\nwhere {\\displaystyle q(i)} is the demand for product i. [S55] Elasticity of substitution is {\\displaystyle \\sigma =1/(1-\\rho )}, where {\\displaystyle 0<\\rho <1}. [S56] Then we have the revenue for the producer {\\displaystyle r(i)=R(p(i)/P)^{1-\\sigma }}, and the demand is {\\displaystyle q(i)=Q(p(i)/P)^{-\\sigma }}. [S57] The price is given by {\\displaystyle p(i)=r(i)/q(i)}. [S58] We also have the price rule {\\displaystyle p(i)=W\\_{i}/(\\rho \\phi \\_{i})},\nwhere {\\displaystyle W\\_{i}} and {\\displaystyle \\phi \\_{i}} are the nominal wage and productivity, respectively of firm i. [S59] Here productivity and firm-specific wage are seen as performance indicators of a firm, and the\ninverse marginal cost {\\displaystyle z\\_{i}=\\phi \\_{i}/W\\_{i}} for company i is introduced to reflect them. [S60] Zero cutoff productivity (ZCP) condition {\\displaystyle r(z^{\\*})/\\sigma -f=0}\nand Free Entry (FE) condition {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {\\pi }}(z^{\\*})={\\frac {\\delta f\\_{e}}{1-G(z^{\\*})}}}\nallow us to determine the equilibrium marginal entrant {\\displaystyle z^{\\*}},\nwhere {\\displaystyle G(z)=Pr[Z\\leq z]} is the cumulative distribution function.",
    "[S61] Then the equilibrium point is used for providing the average wage distortion:\n\nwhere {\\displaystyle \\psi (i|z^{\\*})} is the density of active firms, and {\\displaystyle f\\_{e}} is fixed entry cost. [S62] {\\displaystyle \\delta } is firm death rate, and a firm type is identified by {\\displaystyle i=(\\phi ,W)}. [S63] With the monitoring ability {\\displaystyle {\\bar {m}}} of the firm most proficient at monitoring, the equilibrium unemployment rate is determined by\n\nwhere {\\displaystyle A\\_{1}=\\delta (e-1)/(e{\\bar {m}})}. [S64] Also, the equilibrium mass of firms is determined by\n\nThey consider Regions I to IV in the {\\displaystyle \\phi \\_{i}W\\_{i}}-plane according to marginal costs. [S65] Suppose firms paying the highest level of\nmarginal cost in autarky are on the line {\\displaystyle W\\_{i}=(1/z\\_{a}^{\\*})\\phi \\_{i}}, and the marginal entrant in freer trade is\non the line {\\displaystyle W\\_{i}=(1/z)\\phi \\_{i}}. [S66] The marginal exporter and firms making minimum profits in freer trade are on\n{\\displaystyle W\\_{i}=(1/z\\_{x})\\phi \\_{i}} and {\\displaystyle W\\_{i}=(1/z\\_{\\pi })\\phi \\_{i}}, respectively. [S67] Thus, these regions are given by:\n\nThe big companies increase their profits in Region IV in freer trade, while firms in Region II and III decrease profits. [S68] All firms in Region I exit in freer trade, and therefore their profits and output plunge to zero. [S69] Suppose {\\displaystyle {\\bar {W\\_{a}}}} is the average wage in autarky. [S70] Then a good job in autarky is defined as one that pays a wage {\\displaystyle W\\_{a}} such that {\\displaystyle W\\_{a}>{\\bar {W\\_{a}}}}. [S71] For a specific productivity, the highest paying jobs in autarky are in Region I, and they are lost in freer trade. [S72] The second highest paying jobs are in Region II, and some of them are lost in freer trade. [S73] The lowest paying jobs are in Region IV, and they expand in freer trade. [S74] Davis and Harrigan carry out numerical simulations and find that\na trade liberalization destroys up to 25 percent of good jobs."
