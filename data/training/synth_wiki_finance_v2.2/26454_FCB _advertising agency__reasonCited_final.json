      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about unique awards or honors specifically mentioned for FCB in the context and which campaigns or offices received them.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting passage carefully. The passage has several sections with different years and mentions various awards. The key here is to identify which awards are specifically tied to FCB and not just Draftfcb, since the user mentioned \"FCB\" but the passage uses \"Draftfcb\" sometimes. Wait, but maybe FCB is the same as Draftfcb? The user might be using FCB as an abbreviation. I'll assume that FCB refers to Draftfcb unless stated otherwise.\n\nLooking at the passage:\n\n- [S28] mentions Draftfcb-created spots for KFC, Oreo, Taco Bell, and a specific ad for EA Games' Mercenaries 2. But this is more about the ads rather than awards. However, Time.com's Lev Grossman called it the greatest video game ad of 2008. But the question is about awards or honors for FCB, so maybe this is a mention of recognition, but not an award. Not sure yet.\n\n- [S29] says the agency was recognized on Advertising Age's A-List in 2009. That's an honor. So \"A-List\" is an award here. The citation is [S29].\n\n- [S30] mentions the 2010 U.S. Census campaign by Draftfcb New York received Gold in multicultural category and Research Achievement Award at the 2010 Advertising Research Foundation David Ogilvy Awards. So that's two awards: Gold in multicultural and Research Achievement Award. The campaign was the 2010 U.S. Census. Citation [S30].\n\n- [S31] mentions 345 awards globally in 2010, including six best workplace honors for Draftfcb Chicago. So the workplace honors are awards. But the question is about campaigns or offices. So the office here is Draftfcb Chicago, and the award is six best workplace honors. But the user might be looking for specific campaign awards. Maybe this is relevant but not sure.\n\n- [S32] mentions Draftfcb Spain's \"Cutty Shark Shanghai-London\" as one of the Top 10 events. Not sure if that's an award or just recognition. Maybe not an award.\n\n- [S33] Draftfcb Malaysia was number one creative agency in Malaysia (2010) by Cream Magazine. That's an honor, but maybe not an award. The user might consider it as an honor.\n\n- [S34] is a section divider.\n\n- [S35] Draftfcb New Zealand: Best in Show, Media Agency of the Year, Leadership; five gold and three silver at CAANZ Awards. So awards here: Best in Show, Media Agency of the Year, Leadership, and awards at CAANZ. The office is New Zealand.\n\n- [S36] Media Agency of the Year at Fairfax Media/AdMedia Awards in 2011, 2010, 2008. So that's another award for the office (probably New Zealand, since [S35] is New Zealand). But the citation here is [S36].\n\n- [S37] Draftfcb San Francisco: \"Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2\" - Gold in Outstanding Overall Marketing Campaign at Cannes Lions 2011. So the campaign is \"Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2\" and the award is Gold in that category. Citation [S37].\n\n- [S38] 17 Cannes Lions (2012), four ARF David Ogilvy Awards. So 17 Lions, but not specific campaigns. But maybe the campaigns are mentioned elsewhere. Also, the ARF awards.\n\n- [S39] Three CLIO Awards. Again, not specific campaigns here.\n\n- [S40] 2013: OREO \"Daily Twist,\" New Zealand's Mini \"Driving Dogs.\" Chicago's Halloween web video for Kmart, and Argentina's work for ZonaJobs and Orange County's \"Operation Alaska\" for Taco Bell. Then, Draftfcb Healthcare's \"Escape The Stall\" for Crohn's & Colitis Founding was named Best Philanthropic Campaign at Manny Awards. So the campaign \"Escape The Stall\" received an award. Citation [S40].\n\n- [S41] Draftfcb Healthcare won for \"Get Your Shift Together\" in Best Nonbranded Campaign for TEVA. Citation [S41].\n\n- [S42] Draftfcb won three Reggie Awards for OREO 100th Birthday Celebration, Sharpie, and Taco Bell. So the campaigns are those three, and the award is Reggie Awards. [S42].\n\n- [S43] Eight offices won 14 CLIO Awards, six One Show PENCIL Awards for various campaigns. Also, five North American Effie Awards for OREO \"Daily Twist,\" PFLAG \"Stories to Inspire Change,\" SPIRIVA \"Elephant.\" Also 35 Lions and a Grand Prix at Cannes 2013. So multiple awards here. The campaigns mentioned are OREO Daily Twist, PFLAG, SPIRIVA. Also, the CLIOs, One Show, Effie, Lions.\n\n- [S44] Adweek awarded Draftfcb the first-ever Project Isaac Gravity Award. [S44].\n\n- Then 2014-2016 sections:\n\n- [S45] 38 Lions in 2014, including Grand Prix. [S45]\n\n- [S46] FCB Brasil's \"Protection Ad\" recognized at various awards. [S46]\n\n- [S47] FCB won gold for \"Bank Job,\" \"A Rainbow for the Rainbow Nation\" in Media, \"Speaking Exchange\" in Direct, \"Protection Ad\" in Mobile and Media. [S47]\n\n- [S48] 2015: Sport England's \"This Girl Can\" by FCB Inferno won D&AD, Creative Circle, British Arrows. [S48]\n\n- [S49] FCB won Grand Prix for Good at Lions Health for \"This Girl Can.\" [S49]\n\n- [S50] 2016: FCB South Africa won Agency of the Year at Cristal Festival. [S50]\n\n- [S51] 2017-2020: FCB received The One Club award in 2017 and 2018. [S51]\n\nNow, the user is asking for unique awards or honors specifically mentioned for FCB. So need to list each award, the campaign or office that received it, and the citation.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Advertising Age's A-List (2009) - [S29]. The agency (Draftfcb) was recognized here.\n\n2. 2010 U.S. Census campaign (Draftfcb New York) - Gold in multicultural category and Research Achievement Award at David Ogilvy Awards [S30].\n\n3. Draftfcb New Zealand: Best in Show, Media Agency of the Year, Leadership; CAANZ Awards (five gold, three silver) [S35].\n\n4. Media Agency of the Year at Fairfax Media/AdMedia Awards (2011, 2010, 2008) [S36].\n\n5. \"Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2\" campaign (Draftfcb San Francisco) - Gold in Outstanding Overall Marketing Campaign at Cannes Lions 2011 [S37].\n\n6. \"Escape The Stall\" campaign (Draftfcb Healthcare) - Best Philanthropic Campaign at Manny Awards [S40].\n\n7. \"Get Your Shift Together\" campaign (Draftfcb Healthcare) - Best Nonbranded Campaign for TEVA [S41].\n\n8. Three Reggie Awards for OREO 100th Birthday Celebration, Sharpie, Taco Bell [S42].\n\n9. 17 Cannes Lions (2012) and four ARF David Ogilvy Awards [S38].\n\n10. 14 CLIO Awards (eight offices) [S43].\n\n11. Five North American Effie Awards for OREO \"Daily Twist,\" PFLAG \"Stories to Inspire Change,\" SPIRIVA \"Elephant\" [S43].\n\n12. 35 Lions and a Grand Prix at 2013 Cannes Lions [S43].\n\n13. Adweek's Project Isaac Gravity Award [S44].\n\n14. 38 Lions including Grand Prix in 2014 [S45].\n\n15. FCB Brasil's \"Protection Ad\" recognized at various awards [S46].\n\n16. Gold awards for \"Bank Job,\" \"A Rainbow for the Rainbow Nation,\" \"Speaking Exchange,\" \"Protection Ad\" at Cannes [S47].\n\n17. Sport England's \"This Girl Can\" (FCB Inferno) won D&AD, Creative Circle, British Arrows [S48].\n\n18. Grand Prix for Good at Lions Health for \"This Girl Can\" [S49].\n\n19. FCB South Africa won Agency of the Year at Cristal Festival 2016 [S50].\n\n20. The One Club award in 2017 and 2018 [S51].\n\nBut the question is about \"unique awards or honors specifically mentioned for FCB\". Some of these might be for Draftfcb, but the user might be referring to FCB as the same entity. Also, need to check if the awards are unique. For example, the A-List is an honor, the David Ogilvy Awards, Cannes Lions, CLIOs, etc.\n\nNow, the user also asks which campaigns or offices received them. So for each award, note the campaign or office.\n\nBut the answer needs to be in the format where each sentence is a statement with citations. So I need to structure each unique award and the corresponding campaign/office, with the citations.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The A-List honor in 2009 [S29].\n\n- The 2010 U.S. Census campaign by Draftfcb New York received Gold and Research Achievement Award [S30].\n\n- Draftfcb New Zealand received Best in Show, Media Agency of the Year, etc. [S35].\n\n- The \"Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2\" campaign by Draftfcb San Francisco won Gold at Cannes [S37].\n\n- \"Escape The Stall\" by Draftfcb Healthcare won Best Philanthropic Campaign [S40].\n\n- \"Get Your Shift Together\" by Draftfcb Healthcare for TEVA [S41].\n\n- Reggie Awards for OREO, Sharpie, Taco Bell [S42].\n\n- 17 Cannes Lions (2012) and ARF David Ogilvy Awards [S38].\n\n- 14 CLIO Awards (eight offices) [S43].\n\n- Effie Awards for OREO Daily Twist, PFLAG, SPIRIVA [S43].\n\n- 35 Lions and Grand Prix at Cannes 2013 [S43].\n\n- Project Isaac Gravity Award from Adweek [S44].\n\n- 38 Lions in 2014 [S45].\n\n- \"Protection Ad\" by FCB Brasil [S46].\n\n- Gold awards at Cannes for \"Bank Job,\" etc. [S47].\n\n- \"This Girl Can\" by FCB Inferno [S48].\n\n- Grand Prix for Good for \"This Girl Can\" [S49].\n\n- FCB South Africa's Agency of the Year [S50].\n\n- The One Club awards in 2017 and 2018 [S51].\n\nBut need to check if these are all unique. For example, the Cannes Lions are mentioned multiple times, but each instance is a different year or campaign. Also, the user might want specific campaigns, not just the number of awards.\n\nNow, the answer should list each unique award and the campaign/office. So I need to structure each statement with the award, the campaign/office, and the citations.\n\nBut the user might want the answer to be concise, listing each award once. For example, the A-List is one, the 2010 Census campaign is another, etc.\n\nSo the final answer would be a series of statements, each with the award, campaign/office, and citations."

[S53] ## Bully Hunters\n\nFCB Media initiated a marketing campaign called Bully Hunters which consisted of a livestream event held in mid-April 2018 which aimed to combat misogynist harassment in video games by deploying \"bully hunters\" to kill abusive opponents in the game *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*. [S54] The livestream itself consisted of pre-recorded footage of faked harassment as acted out by associates of FCB Media. [S55] Claimed sponsors of the event included SteelSeries, Vertagear, CyberPowerPC, the Diverse Gaming Coalition, and the National Organization for Women. [S56] SteelSeries considered the campaign to be damaging to their brand and misrepresented the level of SteelSeries involvement. [S57] The company released a statement stating that the way Bully Hunters represented the gaming community was wrong and disingenuous, adding stating that SteelSeries was not involved in the management of the event and did not pay FCB Media to produce it. [S58] A CyberPowerPC representative stated \"What they told us was completely [different?] than the way they executed it\" and that they felt misled. [S59] Brandon Cooke, FCB's global chief communications officer, told *Polygon* \"As this effort did not live up to our high standards, we decided to end this program, but hope the conversation it has raised around ending harassment in gaming continues\". [S60] By the end of the campaign all claimed sponsors had withdrawn their support.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] FCB (advertising agency)\n\n\n# FCB (advertising agency)\n\n\n\n**Foote, Cone & Belding** (**FCB**) is one of the largest global advertising agency networks. [S2] It is owned by Interpublic Group and was merged in 2006 with Draft Worldwide, adopting the name Draftfcb. [S3] In 2014 the company rebranded itself as FCB. [S4] Parent Interpublic Group is one of the big four agency holding conglomerates, the others being Publicis, WPP, and Omnicom. [S5] ## History\n\nFounded by Daniel Lord and Ambrose Thomas as **Lord & Thomas** in Chicago in 1873, FCB is the third-oldest advertising agency in the U.S. [S6] still operating today. [S7] Albert Lasker began work for the firm as a clerk in 1898, working his way up until he purchased it in 1912. [S8] Chicago and New York were centers of the nation's advertising industry at the time, and Lasker, known as the \"father of modern advertising,\" made Chicago his base from 1898 to 1942. [S9] When the agency acquired the Sunkist Growers, Incorporated account, the citrus industry was in a slump with an excess of produce. [S10] Lasker helped increase the consumption of oranges by creating a new market with his \"Drink an orange\" ads. [S11] Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex feminine hygiene products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture. [S12] In 1942, Lasker sold Lord & Thomas to its three top managers, Emerson H. [S13] Foote in New York City, Fairfax Cone in Chicago, and Don Belding in California; they renamed it Foote, Cone & Belding. [S14] In 1963, Foote, Cone & Belding began to offer stock and went public. [S15] FCB began to expand in Europe that year. [S16] In the 1970s and '80s major clients included Mazda, RJR Nabisco, AT&T, Coors Brewing Company, Payless ShoeSource and Mattel. [S17] In the 1980s, the agency began an international expansion. [S18] In December 1994, FCB created a new holding company, True North Communications, to become a major multinational player. [S19] In 2000, it had more than 190 offices serving clients in 102 countries.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn 2001, ad network Interpublic Group acquired True North Communications. [S20] Draft Direct Worldwide and FCB merged in June 2006, to form Draftfcb. [S21] Less than a year after the merger, in April 2007, Kmart switched its $740 million account from Grey New York to Draftfcb Chicago without a pitch. [S22] On 10 March 2014, the agency was renamed as FCB, six months after the appointment of worldwide CEO Carter Murray. [S23] In 2016, Susan Credle joined the agency as Global Chief Creative Officer. [S24] In 2019, Ad Age named FCB to its 2019 A-List and FCB/SIX earns Data/Analytics Agency of the Year. [S25] ## Campaigns and awards\n\nThe agency and its work have been recognized at a number of award competitions\u2014Cannes, *The One Show*, and industry competitions Echoes, El Ojo, Effies, and Caples\u2014as well as agency-of-the-year honors for its New Zealand, Indonesia, and Durban S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City and Kuwait offices. [S26] Its Canada office has won digital agency-of-the-year in four consecutive years starting in 2016. [S27] ### 2008-2010",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the 2018 Bully Hunters campaign reflected the challenges FCB faced in aligning with sponsor values and what the result was.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The relevant part is in Passage 1 under the \"Bully Hunters\" section. Let me read through that again.\n\nThe Bully Hunters campaign was a livestream event in April 2018 aimed at combating misogynist harassment in video games. They used pre-recorded footage of fake harassment. The sponsors claimed included SteelSeries, Vertagear, CyberPowerPC, etc. But then SteelSeries said the campaign was damaging to their brand and misrepresented their involvement. They weren't involved in management or paid FCB. CyberPowerPC's rep said they were misled. FCB's chief communications officer said they ended the program because it didn't meet their standards. All sponsors withdrew support by the end.\n\nSo, the challenges FCB faced were that the sponsors felt misrepresented. The campaign didn't align with their values because the sponsors didn't actually support the campaign as they thought. The result was that all sponsors withdrew their support.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with citations. The first part about the campaign's aim and the sponsors' withdrawal is in [S54], [S55], [S56], [S57], [S58], [S59], [S60]. The part about the sponsors withdrawing is in [S60]. Also, the statement from Brandon Cooke is in [S60]. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer to reflect how the campaign showed the challenges in aligning with sponsor values. So the key points are that the sponsors were misrepresented, leading to their withdrawal. The citations would be the sentences where SteelSeries and CyberPowerPC's reactions are mentioned, and the withdrawal of support.\n\nSo the first sentence would be about the campaign's approach and the sponsors involved, citing [S54][S55][S56]. Then the next part about the sponsors' reactions, citing [S57][S58][S59]. Then the result of the sponsors withdrawing, citing [S60]. Also, the statement from FCB's officer is in [S60].\n\nI need to make sure each sentence has the correct citations. Let me check each part again.\n\nYes, the first statement about the campaign and sponsors is covered in [S54][S55][S56]. The next part about the sponsors' issues is [S57][S58][S59]. The result is [S60]. Also, the part where FCB ended the program is in [S60]. \n\nSo the answer should have three statements: one explaining the campaign and sponsors, another about the sponsors' issues, and the third about the result. Each with their respective citations."

The relevant information is in Passage 2. Let me scan through the sentences. \n\nIn Passage 2, sentence S3 mentions that in 2014, the company rebranded itself as FCB. Then, sentence S4 states that the parent company, Interpublic Group, is one of the big four agency holding conglomerates, along with Publicis, WPP, and Omnicom. \n\nSo the significance of the 2014 rebranding is likely tied to the parent company's status. Since Interpublic Group is a major player (one of the big four), the rebranding might have been a strategic move to align with the parent company's position. Also, the rebranding could have been part of a broader strategy to strengthen FCB's market presence under Interpublic's umbrella. \n\nI need to check if there's more context. The passage also mentions that FCB was merged with Draft Worldwide in 2006, becoming Draftfcb, and then reverted to FCB in 2014. This suggests that the 2014 rebranding might have been to simplify the name or refocus the brand under the parent company's structure. \n\nThe connection to the parent company's status is that being part of Interpublic Group, a top-tier holding company, would give FCB access to resources and a stronger market position. The rebranding in 2014 could be part of maintaining or enhancing that status. \n\nI don't see other sentences directly linking the rebranding to the parent company's status, so the key citations are S3 and S4. The answer should state that the 2014 rebranding was part of aligning with Interpublic Group's status as a major holding company, reinforcing FCB's position in the industry."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which FCB campaigns received multiple awards across different years and the specific accolades they achieved. The supporting context is provided in the passage with various citations.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each section of the passage and identify campaigns that are mentioned to have multiple awards. Let me start by scanning each paragraph.\n\nLooking at the 2010 U.S. Census campaign: it mentions Gold in multicultural category and Research Achievement Award at the 2010 Advertising Research Foundation David Ogilvy Awards. That's two awards in 2010. So that's one campaign.\n\nNext, Draftfcb San Francisco's \"Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2\" got Gold in the Outstanding Overall Marketing Campaign of the Year at Cannes Lions in 2011. Then, in the 2011-2013 section, it says they had 17 Cannes Lions in 2012, four ARF David Ogilvy Awards, and three CLIO Awards. So that's multiple awards across different years.\n\nThen, in 2013, there's mention of OREO \"Daily Twist,\" New Zealand's Mini \"Driving Dogs,\" Chicago's Kmart Halloween video, and Argentina's ZonaJobs and Orange County's Taco Bell \"Operation Alaska.\" Also, Draftfcb Healthcare's \"Escape The Stall\" won Best Philanthropic Campaign at the Manny Awards. Then, they won three Reggie Awards for OREO 100th Birthday, Sharpie, and Taco Bell. Also, eight offices won 14 CLIOs, six One Show PENCILs, and five North American Effies. Plus 35 Lions and a Grand Prix at Cannes 2013. That's a lot of awards across different categories and years.\n\nIn 2014, FCB Brasil's \"Protection Ad\" was recognized at multiple awards like Clio, London International, El Ojo, One Show, D&AD, Andy, ADC, and won top honor at Cannes Mobile. Then at Cannes 2014, they got Gold for \"Bank Job,\" \"A Rainbow for the Rainbow Nation,\" \"Speaking Exchange,\" and \"Protection Ad.\" So multiple awards here.\n\nIn 2015, Sport England's \"This Girl Can\" by FCB Inferno won two D&AD awards, nine Creative Circle silvers, three British Arrows awards, Grand Prix for Good at Lions Health, and D&AD Award. That's multiple accolades.\n\nIn 2016, FCB South Africa won Agency of the Year at Cristal Festival, and 47 Lions. But the question is about campaigns, not agency awards. So maybe not relevant here.\n\nAlso, in 2017-2018, FCB received The One Club award, but that's a single award each year, not multiple campaigns.\n\nNow, I need to list each campaign that received multiple awards across different years. For example, the 2010 Census campaign has two awards in 2010. The San Francisco campaign has awards in 2011, 2012, 2013. The 2013 campaigns like OREO Daily Twist, etc., have multiple awards. The \"Protection Ad\" in 2014 had multiple recognitions. \"This Girl Can\" in 2015 had several awards.\n\nI need to make sure each statement cites the correct sentences. For example, the 2010 Census campaign is cited in [S30] and [S31]. The San Francisco campaign's 2011 Gold is [S36], and the 2012-2013 awards are in [S37]-[S43]. The 2013 campaigns are in [S39]-[S43]. The 2014 \"Protection Ad\" is [S46]-[S47]. The 2015 \"This Girl Can\" is [S48]-[S49].\n\nI should structure each campaign with their respective awards and cite the relevant sentences. Need to check if each award is mentioned in the passage and attribute the correct citations. Also, ensure that each sentence in the answer is properly cited and that the statements are accurate."

Draftfcb San Francisco's Cannes Lions [S36] and [S37]. The 2013 awards include various offices, so each specific mention would have their own citations.

    "[S1] FCB (advertising agency)\n\n\n# FCB (advertising agency)\n\n\n\n**Foote, Cone & Belding** (**FCB**) is one of the largest global advertising agency networks. [S2] It is owned by Interpublic Group and was merged in 2006 with Draft Worldwide, adopting the name Draftfcb. [S3] In 2014 the company rebranded itself as FCB. [S4] Parent Interpublic Group is one of the big four agency holding conglomerates, the others being Publicis, WPP, and Omnicom. [S5] ## History\n\nFounded by Daniel Lord and Ambrose Thomas as **Lord & Thomas** in Chicago in 1873, FCB is the third-oldest advertising agency in the U.S. [S6] still operating today. [S7] Albert Lasker began work for the firm as a clerk in 1898, working his way up until he purchased it in 1912. [S8] Chicago and New York were centers of the nation's advertising industry at the time, and Lasker, known as the \"father of modern advertising,\" made Chicago his base from 1898 to 1942. [S9] When the agency acquired the Sunkist Growers, Incorporated account, the citrus industry was in a slump with an excess of produce. [S10] Lasker helped increase the consumption of oranges by creating a new market with his \"Drink an orange\" ads. [S11] Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex feminine hygiene products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture. [S12] In 1942, Lasker sold Lord & Thomas to its three top managers, Emerson H. [S13] Foote in New York City, Fairfax Cone in Chicago, and Don Belding in California; they renamed it Foote, Cone & Belding. [S14] In 1963, Foote, Cone & Belding began to offer stock and went public. [S15] FCB began to expand in Europe that year. [S16] In the 1970s and '80s major clients included Mazda, RJR Nabisco, AT&T, Coors Brewing Company, Payless ShoeSource and Mattel. [S17] In the 1980s, the agency began an international expansion. [S18] In December 1994, FCB created a new holding company, True North Communications, to become a major multinational player. [S19] In 2000, it had more than 190 offices serving clients in 102 countries.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn 2001, ad network Interpublic Group acquired True North Communications. [S20] Draft Direct Worldwide and FCB merged in June 2006, to form Draftfcb. [S21] Less than a year after the merger, in April 2007, Kmart switched its $740 million account from Grey New York to Draftfcb Chicago without a pitch. [S22] On 10 March 2014, the agency was renamed as FCB, six months after the appointment of worldwide CEO Carter Murray. [S23] In 2016, Susan Credle joined the agency as Global Chief Creative Officer. [S24] In 2019, Ad Age named FCB to its 2019 A-List and FCB/SIX earns Data/Analytics Agency of the Year. [S25] ## Campaigns and awards\n\nThe agency and its work have been recognized at a number of award competitions\u2014Cannes, *The One Show*, and industry competitions Echoes, El Ojo, Effies, and Caples\u2014as well as agency-of-the-year honors for its New Zealand, Indonesia, and Durban S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City and Kuwait offices.

[S53] ## Bully Hunters\n\nFCB Media initiated a marketing campaign called Bully Hunters which consisted of a livestream event held in mid-April 2018 which aimed to combat misogynist harassment in video games by deploying \"bully hunters\" to kill abusive opponents in the game *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*. [S54] The livestream itself consisted of pre-recorded footage of faked harassment as acted out by associates of FCB Media. [S55] Claimed sponsors of the event included SteelSeries, Vertagear, CyberPowerPC, the Diverse Gaming Coalition, and the National Organization for Women. [S56] SteelSeries considered the campaign to be damaging to their brand and misrepresented the level of SteelSeries involvement. [S57] The company released a statement stating that the way Bully Hunters represented the gaming community was wrong and disingenuous, adding stating that SteelSeries was not involved in the management of the event and did not pay FCB Media to produce it. [S58] A CyberPowerPC representative stated \"What they told us was completely [different?] than the way they executed it\" and that they felt misled. [S59] Brandon Cooke, FCB's global chief communications officer, told *Polygon* \"As this effort did not live up to our high standards, we decided to end this program, but hope the conversation it has raised around ending harassment in gaming continues\". [S60] By the end of the campaign all claimed sponsors had withdrawn their support."
