      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Red Lobster\n\n\n# Red Lobster\n\n\n\n**Red Lobster Hospitality, LLC** is an American casual dining restaurant chain headquartered in Orlando, Florida. [S2] The company has operations across most of the United States and Canada, as well as in Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. [S3] Golden Gate Capital was Red Lobster's parent company after it was acquired from Darden Restaurants on July 28, 2014. [S4] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC. [S5] In May 2024, Red Lobster closed at least 99 of its restaurants and then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. [S6] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it. [S7] ## History\n\n\n### Formation and growth\n\nThe first Red Lobster restaurant was opened on January 18, 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, by entrepreneurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. [S8] The oft-quoted date of March 27, 1968, is based on the incorporation date of Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. [S9] (now GMRI, Inc.) in the Florida Secretary of State's Office. [S10] Originally billed as the \"Harbor for Seafood Lovers\", the first restaurant was followed by four others throughout the American South. [S11] In 1970, General Mills acquired Red Lobster as a five-unit company and with new backing, the chain expanded rapidly in the 1980s. [S12] Red Lobster entered Canada in the 1980s, in many cases by buying Ponderosa Steakhouse locations. [S13] Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada, the bulk in larger urban centres in Ontario (across Southern Ontario (from Southwestern Ontario through Golden Horseshoe and southern to Eastern Ontario) plus one in Sudbury, in northern Ontario and Barrie, Ontario in Central Ontario) with a smaller number in larger urban centres in all three Prairie provinces (Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg). [S14] It exited the Quebec market (14 locations including Vanier and Montreal) in September 1997, due to financial losses, and was entirely absent from the Maritime provinces, British Columbia and the Arctic territories. [S15] In 1991, Red Lobster introduced its now famous garlic cheese biscuits (given the name Cheddar Bay Biscuits in 1996) developed by culinary leader Kurt Hankins. [S16] On March 29, 1994, Bill Darden died, after an extended illness, at the age of 75. [S17] In 1995, Red Lobster (along with Olive Garden and other sister chains), became part of Darden Restaurants, Inc. [S18] During that time, General Mills decided to release Darden into an independent, publicly traded corporation. [S19] ### 2009 prototype and sale\n\nIn 2009, Red Lobster debuted its new Bar Harbor restaurant prototype modeled after coastal New England architecture. [S20] The new exterior features include shingle and stone towers, signal flags, and Adirondack-style benches. [S21] The interior updates include dark wood paneling, warm-toned fabrics, soft lighting, and nautical decor and artwork. [S22] On December 19, 2013, Darden Restaurants announced plans to sell or spin off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors. [S23] This was in direct response to Darden's going over budget on a new digital platform. [S24] On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of its spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations. [S25] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion. [S26] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014. [S27] As part of the sale, a sale/leaseback of the real estate for 500 restaurants was completed to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion to finance the purchase. [S28] By 2023, rents totaled $200 million per year and was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy filing.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the 2014 sale of Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital and how subsequent ownership changes affected the company's financial structure.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the sentences related to the 2014 sale. \n\nLooking at the passage, [S3] mentions that Golden Gate Capital became the parent company after acquiring Red Lobster from Darden in July 2014. That's the sale in question. The significance here might relate to the financial aspects of the sale, like the $2.1 billion price tag mentioned in [S26]. Also, the sale/leaseback of real estate to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion is noted in [S28], which could be part of the financial structure changes.\n\nNext, the question asks about subsequent ownership changes. The passage mentions that Thai Union acquired a 25% stake in 2016 [S4], and then bought the remaining portion in 2020. This would be a significant ownership change. Additionally, the 2024 bankruptcy filing [S5] and the stalking horse agreement [S6] indicate financial difficulties. The rent payments from the sale/leaseback [S28] are cited as a factor in the bankruptcy, so that's a key point about the financial structure.\n\nI need to make sure I connect these points. The 2014 sale to GGC involved a large sum and a leaseback arrangement, which might have affected Red Lobster's liabilities. Then, the later acquisition by Thai Union could have changed ownership structure, but maybe not resolved the financial issues. The bankruptcy in 2024, with rent payments being a factor, shows that the financial structure post-2014 didn't sustain the company.\n\nI should structure the answer by first addressing the significance of the 2014 sale, citing [S3], [S26], and [S28]. Then, discuss the subsequent ownership changes, like Thai Union's stake [S4], and how these, along with the leaseback arrangements, contributed to financial issues leading to bankruptcy [S5][S28]. \n\nWait, the user also asks how ownership changes affected the financial structure. The leaseback arrangement in 2014 (S28) led to annual rents of $200 million, which was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy. So that's a direct link. The sale to GGC and then Thai Union's acquisition might have altered the ownership structure but not the financial obligations from the leaseback. \n\nI need to ensure each statement in the answer has the correct citations. Let me check each part again. The significance of the 2014 sale includes the sale to GGC, the $2.1 billion, and the leaseback. Then, the subsequent ownership by Thai Union and the financial impact leading to bankruptcy. The citations would be [S3][S26][S28] for the sale and [S4][S5][S28] for the later effects."

[S30] On March 6, 2015, Red Lobster officially opened the Restaurant Support Center. [S31] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million, and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC. [S32] ### Restructuring and bankruptcy\n\nIn March 2024, Jonathan Tibus was hired as the company's new CEO. [S33] Tibus previously was CEO during the bankruptcy of Kona Grill and the chief restructuring officer of Krystal. [S34] Officials deemed Red Lobster as a \"zombie brand\" and said that they were exploring options to save the company, including a restructuring turnaround, fire sale, or a possible bankruptcy filing. [S35] Red Lobster also announced that it was searching for a new buyer, and if one could not be found, the company may file for bankruptcy within the coming months. [S36] On April 16, 2024, Bloomberg reported that Red Lobster was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting leases and labor costs among the issues. [S37] The company plans to exit some underperforming leases as well as address other long-term contracts and rising labor costs. [S38] The company expected to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy procedure while discussing a possible bankruptcy debt reduction plan with its creditors. [S39] On May 13, 2024, Red Lobster abruptly closed some restaurants in 28 states. [S40] This included all of its Buffalo-area locations and most of its Orlando-area locations. [S41] TAGeX Brands conducted liquidation auctions for restaurant fixtures and supplies at the closed locations and concluded them by May 16. [S42] On May 14, 2024, Red Lobster announced that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before Memorial Day weekend, planning to restructure agreements with its landlords and creditors in efforts to shed some of its debt. [S43] On May 20, 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. [S44] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it, which will allow for the company to receive financing and shed some of its $1 billion debt. [S45] On May 23, 2024, Red Lobster announced that their Canadian operations would also be declaring bankruptcy by no later than May 28. [S46] The company will close some underperforming Canadian locations during the proceedings. [S47] On June 6, 2024, Red Lobster announced that if their bankruptcy plan ends up getting approved, up to 129 additional locations would be permanently shut down. [S48] One of these locations included their restaurant at Times Square in Manhattan. [S49] On June 12, hip hop rapper Flavor Flav was hired by the company to be the spokesperson of Red Lobster commercials, after he previously ordered the entire Red Lobster menu in order to save the company. [S50] In his first commercial, he would announce that CrabFest would be returning to restaurants nationwide. [S51] On June 14, it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by the Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens, was interested in saving Red Lobster out of bankruptcy. [S52] The company evaluated which regions would fit Red Lobster's attempted comeback and revival. [S53] That same day, Red Lobster Canada announced that it would ask the Ontario court to recognize its stalking horse bid and approve a sales process as soon as next week. [S54] This procedure would allow the company to preserve their operations in Canada, as the bid would allow for lenders avoid the risk of assets being sold for a lower price. [S55] On June 18, an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Red Lobster Canada. [S56] On August 25, 2024, Red Lobster announced the closure of 23 additional restaurants, all of which were set to be shuttered by August 31. [S57] On August 26, Damola Adamolekun was appointed CEO of Red Lobster, replacing Tibus.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S58] On September 5, 2024, a court approved Red Lobster's bankruptcy plan. [S59] RL Investor Holdings, a private group of investors consisted of TCW Private Credit, Blue Torch and funds managed by Fortress Investment Group, acquired the company after court approval on September 16. [S60] Red Lobster officially exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy that day. [S61] ## Promotions\n\nIn 2003, Red Lobster offered an endless snow crab leg promotion, the second in its history. [S62] The promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants, taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris's departure from the company. [S63] The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. [S64] The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. [S65] Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. [S66] This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour. [S67] Red Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals. [S68] In June 2023, Red Lobster reintroduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp, normally run as a limited-time promotion during autumn, as a permanent addition to their menu. [S69] For $20, guests could order two shrimp dishes to start, and keep ordering until they were full. [S70] This resulted in a $11 million loss for Red Lobster in its third quarter earnings for that year, as the company underestimated the amount of customers taking advantage of a deal that had low profit margins. [S71] In response, Red Lobster raised the prices on the deal twice, from $20 to $22, and then to $25. [S72] ## Menu\n\nThe brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp. [S73] It also serves chicken, desserts, pasta, and steak.\u1d56\u02b3\u1d52\u1d50\u1d52\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f\u1d43\u02e1 \u02e2\u1d52\u1d58\u02b3\u1d9c\u1d49? [S74] ### Lobster bisque controversy\n\nIn February 2016, *Inside Edition* reported that Red Lobster used a mix of less expensive langostino along with Maine lobster in its lobster bisque recipe. [S75] ## Locations\n\nAs of February 13, 2025, the company had 514 locations worldwide. [S76] These locations span 44 US states, Canada, Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. [S77] ## In popular culture\n\nIn 2007, writer Stewart O'Nan published the novella *Last Night at the Lobster* about the closing of a Red Lobster restaurant in Connecticut. [S78] In February 2016, singer Beyonc\u00e9 referenced Red Lobster in her single \"Formation\".

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that contributed to Red Lobster's financial difficulties and how the company tried to address them through promotions and restructuring. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections: one about restructuring and bankruptcy, and another about promotions. Let me start by identifying the factors leading to financial issues.\n\nLooking at the first passage, there are mentions of leases and labor costs as issues. Specifically, [S37] says Bloomberg reported that Red Lobster was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting leases and labor costs. Also, [S38] mentions exiting underperforming leases and addressing long-term contracts and rising labor costs. Then, [S44] notes they filed for bankruptcy after securing $100 million in financing, and [S45] talks about a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and shed $1 billion debt. Additionally, [S43] mentions restructuring agreements with landlords and creditors. So the main factors here are high leases, labor costs, long-term contracts, and significant debt.\n\nNow, for the restructuring efforts: [S32] mentions the restructuring and bankruptcy section. [S33]-[S36] talk about hiring a new CEO, exploring options like restructuring, fire sale, or bankruptcy. [S37]-[S44] detail the bankruptcy filing, exiting leases, dealing with creditors, and the stalking horse agreement. [S45] also mentions the sale to lenders. Then, [S56] says an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Canada. So restructuring included bankruptcy filings, selling assets, renegotiating contracts, and seeking new buyers.\n\nFor promotional strategies, the second passage has info. [S62]-[S67] discuss the 2003 endless snow crab leg promotion that led to a $3 million charge and the CEO leaving. [S68]-[S72] mention the 2020 Daily Deals menu, Ultimate Endless Shrimp in 2023, which caused a $11 million loss, leading to price increases. Also, [S71] and [S72] note the loss and price adjustments. Additionally, [S51] mentions Flavor Flav as a spokesperson for CrabFest. So promotions like endless shrimp and crab deals were used, but they sometimes backfired financially.\n\nWait, the user also asked how the company attempted to address issues through both promotional strategies and restructuring. So the restructuring part is the bankruptcy, selling assets, renegotiating debts, etc. Promotional strategies include the deals like Endless Shrimp and CrabFest, even though some were costly.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For factors: [S37], [S38], [S44], [S45]. For restructuring: [S33]-[S36], [S37]-[S44], [S45], [S56]. For promotions: [S62]-[S67], [S68]-[S72], [S51]. Also, the CrabFest revival with Flavor Flav in [S51].\n\nI need to structure the answer into statements, each with their citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>. Also, check if all relevant points are covered. Let me piece this together."

[S32] ### Restructuring and bankruptcy\n\nIn March 2024, Jonathan Tibus was hired as the company's new CEO. [S33] Tibus previously was CEO during the bankruptcy of Kona Grill and the chief restructuring officer of Krystal. [S34] Officials deemed Red Lobster as a \"zombie brand\" and said that they were exploring options to save the company, including a restructuring turnaround, fire sale, or a possible bankruptcy filing. [S35] Red Lobster also announced that it was searching for a new buyer, and if one could not be found, the company may file for bankruptcy within the coming months. [S36] On April 16, 2024, Bloomberg reported that Red Lobster was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting leases and labor costs among the issues. [S37] The company plans to exit some underperforming leases as well as address other long-term contracts and rising labor costs. [S38] The company expected to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy procedure while discussing a possible bankruptcy debt reduction plan with its creditors. [S39] On May 13, 2024, Red Lobster abruptly closed some restaurants in 28 states. [S40] This included all of its Buffalo-area locations and most of its Orlando-area locations. [S41] TAGeX Brands conducted liquidation auctions for restaurant fixtures and supplies at the closed locations and concluded them by May 16. [S42] On May 14, 2024, Red Lobster announced that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before Memorial Day weekend, planning to restructure agreements with its landlords and creditors in efforts to shed some of its debt. [S43] On May 20, 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. [S44] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it, which will allow for the company to receive financing and shed some of its $1 billion debt. [S45] On May 23, 2024, Red Lobster announced that their Canadian operations would also be declaring bankruptcy by no later than May 28. [S46] The company will close some underperforming Canadian locations during the proceedings. [S47] On June 6, 2024, Red Lobster announced that if their bankruptcy plan ends up getting approved, up to 129 additional locations would be permanently shut down. [S48] One of these locations included their restaurant at Times Square in Manhattan. [S49] On June 12, hip hop rapper Flavor Flav was hired by the company to be the spokesperson of Red Lobster commercials, after he previously ordered the entire Red Lobster menu in order to save the company. [S50] In his first commercial, he would announce that CrabFest would be returning to restaurants nationwide. [S51] On June 14, it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by the Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens, was interested in saving Red Lobster out of bankruptcy. [S52] The company evaluated which regions would fit Red Lobster's attempted comeback and revival. [S53] That same day, Red Lobster Canada announced that it would ask the Ontario court to recognize its stalking horse bid and approve a sales process as soon as next week. [S54] This procedure would allow the company to preserve their operations in Canada, as the bid would allow for lenders avoid the risk of assets being sold for a lower price. [S55] On June 18, an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Red Lobster Canada. [S56] On August 25, 2024, Red Lobster announced the closure of 23 additional restaurants, all of which were set to be shuttered by August 31.

[S62] The promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants, taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris's departure from the company. [S63] The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. [S64] The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. [S65] Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. [S66] This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour. [S67] Red Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals. [S68] In June 2023, Red Lobster reintroduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp, normally run as a limited-time promotion during autumn, as a permanent addition to their menu. [S69] For $20, guests could order two shrimp dishes to start, and keep ordering until they were full. [S70] This resulted in a $11 million loss for Red Lobster in its third quarter earnings for that year, as the company underestimated the amount of customers taking advantage of a deal that had low profit margins.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how Red Lobster's promotional strategies, like the endless shrimp deal, affected their financial performance and what measures they took to mitigate these effects during bankruptcy.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections: one about restructuring and bankruptcy, and another about promotions, menu, etc. The question is about the impact of promotions on finances and mitigation measures during bankruptcy.\n\nLooking at the promotions section (Passage 2), there's mention of the 2003 endless snow crab leg promotion. It says that this led to a $3 million charge for Darden Restaurants, which caused the president's departure. The promotion was launched when crab prices were high, and they underestimated customer orders, leading to operational issues. Then, in 2020, they had a Daily Deals menu with Endless Shrimp Mondays. In 2023, they made Ultimate Endless Shrimp a permanent menu item, which resulted in an $11 million loss in Q3 because they didn't anticipate how many customers would take advantage of the low-margin deal. They raised the price twice after that.\n\nSo, the endless shrimp deal (and the earlier crab promotion) caused financial losses. The measures taken to mitigate were increasing the price of the deal. However, the question also asks about measures during bankruptcy proceedings. Looking at the bankruptcy section (Passage 1), they mentioned exiting underperforming leases, addressing long-term contracts, labor costs, and filing for Chapter 11 to restructure debts. They also sold the company to RL Investor Holdings, which acquired it after court approval. Additionally, they closed many locations as part of the bankruptcy process.\n\nBut the user specifically asks about measures taken to mitigate the effects of the promotional strategies. The price increases for the shrimp deal are directly related. However, the bankruptcy measures like closing locations and restructuring debts might be more about overall financial recovery rather than specifically mitigating the promotional impacts. However, the question combines both the impact of the promotions and the mitigation during bankruptcy. So, the answer should include both the financial losses from the promotions and the steps taken (like price hikes and bankruptcy restructuring).\n\nNow, I need to cite the relevant sentences. For the impact of the promotions: S62-S71 (the 2003 crab promotion and the 2023 shrimp deal). The price increases are mentioned in S72. For the bankruptcy measures, the restructuring steps like exiting leases, addressing contracts, and the sale to RL Investor Holdings (S33-S56, S58-S61). However, the user is asking about measures taken to mitigate the effects of the promotions. The bankruptcy proceedings' measures might not directly address the promotional strategies but rather the overall financial issues. However, the price hikes for the shrimp deal are a direct mitigation step. So, the answer should link the promotional strategies' impact (losses) and the mitigation (price increases) and the broader bankruptcy measures.\n\nWait, but the question is about how the promotional strategies impacted financial performance and what measures were taken during bankruptcy to mitigate those effects. So the promotional strategies caused losses (as per S62-S71), and during bankruptcy, they took steps like closing locations, restructuring, and selling the company. However, the price increases for the shrimp deal were part of their mitigation, but that was before bankruptcy. The bankruptcy measures were more about overall financial restructuring. So the answer needs to mention both the impact of the promotions (losses) and the mitigation during bankruptcy (closing locations, restructuring, etc.), even if those are broader measures.\n\nSo, the answer would be: The endless shrimp deal led to an $11 million loss in 2023 due to underestimating customer demand (S71), and the company raised prices to mitigate this (S72). During bankruptcy, Red Lobster closed underperforming locations, exited leases, and restructured debts (S38, S48, S57). They also sold the company to RL Investor Holdings (S59-S61). The promotional strategies' financial impact was part of the broader financial issues that led to bankruptcy, and the mitigation involved both price adjustments and bankruptcy restructuring.\n\nI need to structure this into statements with citations. Each sentence should have its own citations. For example, the first statement about the shrimp deal causing loss would cite S71, then the price increase cites S72. Then the bankruptcy measures would cite the relevant sentences from Passage 1."

[S43] On May 20, 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. [S44] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it, which will allow for the company to receive financing and shed some of its $1 billion debt. [S45] On May 23, 2024, Red Lobster announced that their Canadian operations would also be declaring bankruptcy by no later than May 28. [S46] The company will close some underperforming Canadian locations during the proceedings. [S47] On June 6, 2024, Red Lobster announced that if their bankruptcy plan ends up getting approved, up to 129 additional locations would be permanently shut down. [S48] One of these locations included their restaurant at Times Square in Manhattan. [S49] On June 12, hip hop rapper Flavor Flav was hired by the company to be the spokesperson of Red Lobster commercials, after he previously ordered the entire Red Lobster menu in order to save the company. [S50] In his first commercial, he would announce that CrabFest would be returning to restaurants nationwide. [S51] On June 14, it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by the Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens, was interested in saving Red Lobster out of bankruptcy. [S52] The company evaluated which regions would fit Red Lobster's attempted comeback and revival. [S53] That same day, Red Lobster Canada announced that it would ask the Ontario court to recognize its stalking horse bid and approve a sales process as soon as next week. [S54] This procedure would allow the company to preserve their operations in Canada, as the bid would allow for lenders avoid the risk of assets being sold for a lower price. [S55] On June 18, an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Red Lobster Canada. [S56] On August 25, 2024, Red Lobster announced the closure of 23 additional restaurants, all of which were set to be shuttered by August 31. [S57] On August 26, Damola Adamolekun was appointed CEO of Red Lobster, replacing Tibus.",
        "[S58] On September 5, 2024, a court approved Red Lobster's bankruptcy plan. [S59] RL Investor Holdings, a private group of investors consisted of TCW Private Credit, Blue Torch and funds managed by Fortress Investment Group, acquired the company after court approval on September 16. [S60] Red Lobster officially exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy that day. [S61] ## Promotions\n\nIn 2003, Red Lobster offered an endless snow crab leg promotion, the second in its history. [S62] The promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants, taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris's departure from the company. [S63] The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. [S64] The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. [S65] Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. [S66] This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour. [S67] Red Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals. [S68] In June 2023, Red Lobster reintroduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp, normally run as a limited-time promotion during autumn, as a permanent addition to their menu. [S69] For $20, guests could order two shrimp dishes to start, and keep ordering until they were full. [S70] This resulted in a $11 million loss for Red Lobster in its third quarter earnings for that year, as the company underestimated the amount of customers taking advantage of a deal that had low profit margins. [S71] In response, Red Lobster raised the prices on the deal twice, from $20 to $22, and then to $25. [S72] ## Menu\n\nThe brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp. [S73] It also serves chicken, desserts, pasta, and steak.\u1d56\u02b3\u1d52\u1d50\u1d52\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f\u1d43\u02e1 \u02e2\u1d52\u1d58\u02b3\u1d9c\u1d49?

[S75] ## Locations\n\nAs of February 13, 2025, the company had 514 locations worldwide. [S76] These locations span 44 US states, Canada, Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. [S77] ## In popular culture\n\nIn 2007, writer Stewart O'Nan published the novella *Last Night at the Lobster* about the closing of a Red Lobster restaurant in Connecticut. [S78] In February 2016, singer Beyonc\u00e9 referenced Red Lobster in her single \"Formation\". [S79] After unexpectedly releasing the single and performing it during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, Red Lobster reported a 33% sales increase."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of leadership changes in Red Lobster's restructuring efforts and how these changes coincided with the company's bankruptcy and sale process.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me scan through them to find mentions of leadership changes, restructuring, bankruptcy, and sale processes.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a section starting with \"Restructuring and bankruptcy\". Here, I see that in March 2024, Jonathan Tibus was hired as the new CEO. The citation here is [S33]. Then, [S34] mentions that Tibus previously worked on bankruptcy cases at Kona Grill and Krystal. This suggests that his experience in restructuring might be relevant. \n\nLater, in Passage 1, [S35] talks about the company being deemed a \"zombie brand\" and exploring options like restructuring. [S36] mentions they were searching for a new buyer, possibly leading to bankruptcy. Then, [S44] states that Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after securing financing. [S45] mentions a stalking horse agreement to sell the company. \n\nThen, in [S56], there's a court approval for the sale procedure in Canada. [S57] and [S58] talk about closures and the court approving the bankruptcy plan. [S59] mentions the acquisition by RL Investor Holdings. \n\nIn Passage 2, [S60] and [S61] note the exit from bankruptcy. \n\nNow, leadership changes: [S33] and [S34] about Tibus. Then, [S57] mentions Damola Adamolekun being appointed CEO in August 2024, replacing Tibus. So there's a change from Tibus to Adamolekun. \n\nThe question is how these leadership changes played a role in restructuring and coincided with bankruptcy and sale. \n\nFrom the context, Tibus was brought in as CEO in March 2024, and he had prior experience in bankruptcy restructuring. His appointment might be part of the restructuring efforts. Then, after the bankruptcy filing and sale process, he was replaced by Adamolekun. \n\nThe timing of his appointment (March 2024) coincides with the company's announcement of exploring bankruptcy options. The leadership change might be part of the strategy to restructure. The sale process and bankruptcy filing happened after his appointment. \n\nSo, the answer would need to connect Tibus's role in restructuring, his background, and the timing of his appointment with the bankruptcy and sale. Also, the subsequent leadership change in August 2024 when the sale was being finalized. \n\nI need to make sure to cite the relevant sentences. For example, the hiring of Tibus [S33], his background [S34], the bankruptcy filing [S44], the sale process [S45], and the leadership change [S57]. \n\nI should structure the answer to first state that leadership changes, specifically hiring Tibus with restructuring experience, were part of the efforts. Then note that his tenure coincided with bankruptcy filings and the sale process. Then mention the later leadership change as the sale was finalized. \n\nCheck if there are other sentences that link leadership changes to the restructuring. For example, [S35] mentions the company exploring options, which might be under Tibus's leadership. Also, [S43] mentions the bankruptcy announcement before Memorial Day, which is in May 2024, around when Tibus was already CEO. \n\nSo, the answer would tie Tibus's role to the restructuring and bankruptcy steps, and the subsequent leadership change as part of the sale process."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Red Lobster's menu strategies, specifically the lobster bisque controversy and promotional deals, interacted with their broader financial and operational challenges during bankruptcy.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the sections about promotions and menu strategies. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section on promotions. It mentions the 2003 endless snow crab leg promotion that led to a $3 million charge and the departure of the president. Then there's the 2020 Daily Deals menu with Endless Shrimp Mondays, and the 2023 reintroduction of Ultimate Endless Shrimp as a permanent menu item. This promotion caused an $11 million loss in Q3 2023 because they underestimated customer take-up. They had to raise prices twice. These promotional deals clearly had financial impacts, contributing to losses and forcing price adjustments.\n\nThen there's the lobster bisque controversy in Passage 2, S75. In 2016, they used langostino instead of Maine lobster in their bisque, which might have affected their reputation. However, the context doesn't directly link this controversy to financial issues during bankruptcy. It's more of a reputational issue, but maybe it's part of their broader challenges.\n\nNow, looking at the bankruptcy section in Passage 1. The company faced issues like leases, labor costs, underperforming locations, and $1 billion in debt. They closed many locations, had to restructure, and filed for Chapter 11. The promotional deals' financial impacts (like the $11 million loss) might have exacerbated their financial troubles, making it harder to sustain operations. The menu strategies, while intended to attract customers, might have backfired financially, adding to the pressures that led to bankruptcy.\n\nBut the question is about how these menu strategies interacted with the broader financial and operational challenges. The promotional deals led to significant losses, which would have contributed to the financial strain. The lobster bisque controversy might have affected customer perception, but there's no direct mention of it impacting the bankruptcy. However, the promotional deals' financial hits could have been a factor in their need to restructure.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The promotional deals are covered in S62-S72, and the lobster bisque in S75. The bankruptcy details are in Passage 1, S32 onwards. The interaction would be that the promotional strategies, while aiming to boost sales, resulted in financial losses that added to the company's existing problems, making their financial situation worse and contributing to the need for bankruptcy restructuring.\n\nSo, the answer should connect the promotional deals' financial impacts (losses, price increases) to the broader financial challenges, and note the bisque controversy as a separate issue but possibly contributing to operational or reputational challenges. However, the context doesn't explicitly link the bisque controversy to the bankruptcy, so maybe only the promotional deals are directly relevant here."

[S42] On May 14, 2024, Red Lobster announced that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before Memorial Day weekend, planning to restructure agreements with its landlords and creditors in efforts to shed some of its debt. [S43] On May 20, 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. [S44] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it, which will allow for the company to receive financing and shed some of its $1 billion debt. [S45] On May 23, 2024, Red Lobster announced that their Canadian operations would also be declaring bankruptcy by no later than May 28. [S46] The company will close some underperforming Canadian locations during the proceedings. [S47] On June 6, 2024, Red Lobster announced that if their bankruptcy plan ends up getting approved, up to 129 additional locations would be permanently shut down. [S48] One of these locations included their restaurant at Times Square in Manhattan. [S49] On June 12, hip hop rapper Flavor Flav was hired by the company to be the spokesperson of Red Lobster commercials, after he previously ordered the entire Red Lobster menu in order to save the company. [S50] In his first commercial, he would announce that CrabFest would be returning to restaurants nationwide. [S51] On June 14, it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by the Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens, was interested in saving Red Lobster out of bankruptcy. [S52] The company evaluated which regions would fit Red Lobster's attempted comeback and revival. [S53] That same day, Red Lobster Canada announced that it would ask the Ontario court to recognize its stalking horse bid and approve a sales process as soon as next week. [S54] This procedure would allow the company to preserve their operations in Canada, as the bid would allow for lenders avoid the risk of assets being sold for a lower price. [S55] On June 18, an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Red Lobster Canada. [S56] On August 25, 2024, Red Lobster announced the closure of 23 additional restaurants, all of which were set to be shuttered by August 31. [S57] On August 26, Damola Adamolekun was appointed CEO of Red Lobster, replacing Tibus.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S58] On September 5, 2024, a court approved Red Lobster's bankruptcy plan. [S59] RL Investor Holdings, a private group of investors consisted of TCW Private Credit, Blue Torch and funds managed by Fortress Investment Group, acquired the company after court approval on September 16. [S60] Red Lobster officially exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy that day. [S61] ## Promotions\n\nIn 2003, Red Lobster offered an endless snow crab leg promotion, the second in its history. [S62] The promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants, taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris's departure from the company. [S63] The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. [S64] The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. [S65] Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. [S66] This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour. [S67] Red Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals. [S68] In June 2023, Red Lobster reintroduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp, normally run as a limited-time promotion during autumn, as a permanent addition to their menu. [S69] For $20, guests could order two shrimp dishes to start, and keep ordering until they were full. [S70] This resulted in a $11 million loss for Red Lobster in its third quarter earnings for that year, as the company underestimated the amount of customers taking advantage of a deal that had low profit margins. [S71] In response, Red Lobster raised the prices on the deal twice, from $20 to $22, and then to $25. [S72] ## Menu\n\nThe brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of Red Lobster's bankruptcy and restructuring on its global operations, including U.S. and Canadian locations, and how these actions aligned with their financial recovery strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Let me start by scanning through the sentences to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a lot about the bankruptcy process. For example, in March 2024, they hired a new CEO, Jonathan Tibus. Then there's mention of the company being deemed a \"zombie brand\" and exploring options like restructuring, fire sale, or bankruptcy. They filed for Chapter 11 in May 2024, closed some restaurants in 28 states, including Buffalo and Orlando areas. Then there's info about closing Canadian locations, with the Canadian operations declaring bankruptcy by May 28. They also planned to shut down 129 additional locations if the bankruptcy plan was approved, including Times Square. Then there's the sale to RL Investor Holdings, and the exit from bankruptcy in September 2024.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's more about the bankruptcy plan approval, the sale to investors, and some historical menu promotions. But the user is focused on the bankruptcy and restructuring impact, so maybe the menu stuff isn't directly relevant unless it's part of the financial strategy.\n\nNow, the question is about global operations, including U.S. and Canadian. So I need to check if there are mentions of both. The passage mentions U.S. closures and Canadian bankruptcy. Also, the locations section says 514 worldwide, including Canada, but that's after the bankruptcy. However, the user is asking about the impact during the bankruptcy.\n\nSo, the key points would be:\n\n1. Bankruptcy filing and restructuring efforts (Chapter 11) led to closures of underperforming locations in the U.S. (28 states, including Buffalo and Orlando) and Canada (some underperforming locations). The Canadian operations declared bankruptcy by May 28, 2024.\n\n2. The company planned to shut down 129 additional locations if the bankruptcy plan was approved, including Times Square. Also, 23 more closures by August 31, 2024.\n\n3. The restructuring included exiting underperforming leases, addressing long-term contracts, and labor costs. The sale to RL Investor Holdings and the stalking horse agreement were part of the debt reduction plan.\n\n4. The financial recovery strategy involved exiting bankruptcy, reducing debt, and focusing on viable locations. The sale to investors and the restructuring plan aimed to stabilize the company.\n\nNow, I need to structure these points into statements with citations. Each sentence should be in <statement> tags, and citations in <cite> with the relevant sentence numbers.\n\nCheck for each impact:\n\n- Closures in U.S. and Canada: [S40][S41][S46][S47][S48][S57]\n\n- Restructuring steps: [S38][S43][S44][S45][S54][S55][S56]\n\n- Financial recovery strategy: [S44][S45][S59][S60][S61]\n\nAlso, the CEO changes and the sale to investors are part of the restructuring. The sale to RL Investor Holdings is in [S59][S60][S61].\n\nNeed to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. For example:\n\n- The bankruptcy led to closures in the U.S. and Canada. [S40][S41][S46][S47]\n\n- Restructuring involved exiting leases and addressing contracts. [S38][S43][S44]\n\n- The sale to investors was part of the recovery strategy. [S59][S60][S61]\n\nAlso, the Canadian bankruptcy is mentioned in [S46], and the sale process in Canada in [S54][S55][S56].\n\nNeed to ensure that each statement is accurate and cites the correct sentences. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, the mention of the stalking horse agreement in [S45] and the court approval in [S56].\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should outline the closures, restructuring steps, and how these align with financial recovery through debt reduction and sale to investors."

[S2] The company has operations across most of the United States and Canada, as well as in Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. [S3] Golden Gate Capital was Red Lobster's parent company after it was acquired from Darden Restaurants on July 28, 2014. [S4] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC.

[S6] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it. [S7] ## History\n\n\n### Formation and growth\n\nThe first Red Lobster restaurant was opened on January 18, 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, by entrepreneurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. [S8] The oft-quoted date of March 27, 1968, is based on the incorporation date of Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. [S9] (now GMRI, Inc.) in the Florida Secretary of State's Office. [S10] Originally billed as the \"Harbor for Seafood Lovers\", the first restaurant was followed by four others throughout the American South. [S11] In 1970, General Mills acquired Red Lobster as a five-unit company and with new backing, the chain expanded rapidly in the 1980s. [S12] Red Lobster entered Canada in the 1980s, in many cases by buying Ponderosa Steakhouse locations. [S13] Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada, the bulk in larger urban centres in Ontario (across Southern Ontario (from Southwestern Ontario through Golden Horseshoe and southern to Eastern Ontario) plus one in Sudbury, in northern Ontario and Barrie, Ontario in Central Ontario) with a smaller number in larger urban centres in all three Prairie provinces (Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg). [S14] It exited the Quebec market (14 locations including Vanier and Montreal) in September 1997, due to financial losses, and was entirely absent from the Maritime provinces, British Columbia and the Arctic territories. [S15] In 1991, Red Lobster introduced its now famous garlic cheese biscuits (given the name Cheddar Bay Biscuits in 1996) developed by culinary leader Kurt Hankins. [S16] On March 29, 1994, Bill Darden died, after an extended illness, at the age of 75. [S17] In 1995, Red Lobster (along with Olive Garden and other sister chains), became part of Darden Restaurants, Inc. [S18] During that time, General Mills decided to release Darden into an independent, publicly traded corporation. [S19] ### 2009 prototype and sale\n\nIn 2009, Red Lobster debuted its new Bar Harbor restaurant prototype modeled after coastal New England architecture. [S20] The new exterior features include shingle and stone towers, signal flags, and Adirondack-style benches. [S21] The interior updates include dark wood paneling, warm-toned fabrics, soft lighting, and nautical decor and artwork. [S22] On December 19, 2013, Darden Restaurants announced plans to sell or spin off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors. [S23] This was in direct response to Darden's going over budget on a new digital platform. [S24] On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of its spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations. [S25] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that led to Red Lobster's 2024 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, specifically focusing on prior ownership changes and financial commitments.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passage and identify relevant sentences. Let me start by skimming through each section. \n\nThe passage mentions that Red Lobster was acquired by Golden Gate Capital in 2014 from Darden Restaurants. Then, in 2016, Thai Union bought a 25% stake, and in 2020, they acquired the remaining portion. So ownership changes here might be part of the factors. \n\nLooking at the bankruptcy filing in May 2024, the passage states that they closed 99 restaurants and filed for Chapter 11 after securing $100 million in financing. But there's also a mention of entering a stalking horse agreement to sell the company. However, the key financial factors might be the rent payments. The passage says that by 2023, rents were $200 million per year, which was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy. \n\nThe sale/leaseback in 2014 to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion to finance the purchase. That leaseback arrangement would lead to ongoing rent payments. So the high rent costs over the years accumulated, contributing to financial strain. \n\nAlso, the prior ownership changes: when Darden sold Red Lobster to GGC in 2014, and then Thai Union took over in 2020. Each ownership change might have brought different financial strategies or pressures. The sale/leaseback might have been a way to finance the acquisition but led to long-term rental obligations. \n\nThe passage also mentions that in 2009, they introduced a new prototype, which might have involved costs, but I don't see a direct link to the 2024 bankruptcy. The 2013 decision to sell Red Lobster was due to investor pressure and budget overruns on a digital platform, but that's earlier. \n\nSo the main factors seem to be the high annual rent of $200 million, the prior sale/leaseback arrangement that led to this, and possibly the financial commitments from the ownership changes. The 2024 filing was after securing $100 million in financing, but that might not have been enough. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The rent is mentioned in S28 and S29 (though S29 isn't in the provided text, wait, looking back: the user's passage ends at S28. Wait, the passage says \"By 2023, rents totaled $200 million per year and was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy filing.\" So that's in the passage? Let me check again. \n\nLooking at the passage: \"By 2023, rents totaled $200 million per year and was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy filing.\" But in the given supporting context, the sentences are up to S28. Wait, the user's passage includes:\n\n[S28] By 2023, rents totaled $200 million per year and was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy filing.\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's input, the passage ends with:\n\n[S28] As part of the sale, a sale/leaseback of the real estate for 500 restaurants was completed to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion to finance the purchase.

[S7] ## History\n\n\n### Formation and growth\n\nThe first Red Lobster restaurant was opened on January 18, 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, by entrepreneurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. [S8] The oft-quoted date of March 27, 1968, is based on the incorporation date of Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. [S9] (now GMRI, Inc.) in the Florida Secretary of State's Office. [S10] Originally billed as the \"Harbor for Seafood Lovers\", the first restaurant was followed by four others throughout the American South. [S11] In 1970, General Mills acquired Red Lobster as a five-unit company and with new backing, the chain expanded rapidly in the 1980s. [S12] Red Lobster entered Canada in the 1980s, in many cases by buying Ponderosa Steakhouse locations. [S13] Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada, the bulk in larger urban centres in Ontario (across Southern Ontario (from Southwestern Ontario through Golden Horseshoe and southern to Eastern Ontario) plus one in Sudbury, in northern Ontario and Barrie, Ontario in Central Ontario) with a smaller number in larger urban centres in all three Prairie provinces (Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon and Winnipeg). [S14] It exited the Quebec market (14 locations including Vanier and Montreal) in September 1997, due to financial losses, and was entirely absent from the Maritime provinces, British Columbia and the Arctic territories. [S15] In 1991, Red Lobster introduced its now famous garlic cheese biscuits (given the name Cheddar Bay Biscuits in 1996) developed by culinary leader Kurt Hankins. [S16] On March 29, 1994, Bill Darden died, after an extended illness, at the age of 75. [S17] In 1995, Red Lobster (along with Olive Garden and other sister chains), became part of Darden Restaurants, Inc. [S18] During that time, General Mills decided to release Darden into an independent, publicly traded corporation. [S19] ### 2009 prototype and sale\n\nIn 2009, Red Lobster debuted its new Bar Harbor restaurant prototype modeled after coastal New England architecture. [S20] The new exterior features include shingle and stone towers, signal flags, and Adirondack-style benches. [S21] The interior updates include dark wood paneling, warm-toned fabrics, soft lighting, and nautical decor and artwork. [S22] On December 19, 2013, Darden Restaurants announced plans to sell or spin off the Red Lobster brand, citing pressure from stock investors. [S23] This was in direct response to Darden's going over budget on a new digital platform. [S24] On May 12, 2014, Darden announced that as part of its spinoff of Red Lobster, it was converting the co-located Red Lobster and Olive Garden locations into standalone Olive Garden locations. [S25] On May 16, 2014, Darden announced it would be selling the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain to Golden Gate Capital for US$2.1 billion. [S26] Darden announced the completion of the sale of Red Lobster on July 28, 2014. [S27] As part of the sale, a sale/leaseback of the real estate for 500 restaurants was completed to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion to finance the purchase. [S28] By 2023, rents totaled $200 million per year and was a factor in the 2024 bankruptcy filing.\n\nWait, so S28 is the sentence that mentions the $200 million in rents by 2023 leading to the 2024 bankruptcy. So that's a key point. Also, the sale/leaseback in S27 (the sale/leaseback of real estate for 500 restaurants to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion) would be the reason for the ongoing rent payments. \n\nOwnership changes: the acquisition by Golden Gate Capital in 2014 (S3), then Thai Union's stake in 2016 (S4), and purchasing the rest in 2020 (S4). These changes might have affected the company's financial structure. \n\nAdditionally, the 2024 filing came after securing $100 million in financing (S5), but that might not have been sufficient. \n\nSo the factors are: prior ownership changes (GGC and Thai Union), the sale/leaseback leading to high rent payments ($200M/year), and possibly other financial commitments from the ownership transitions. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the relevant citations. \n\nFirst statement: Ownership changes, like the 2014 acquisition by Golden Gate Capital and the 2020 purchase by Thai Union, may have influenced financial strategies. [S3][S4]\n\nSecond statement: The sale/leaseback arrangement in 2014 led to significant annual rent payments. [S27]\n\nThird statement: By 2023, these rents reached $200 million per year, contributing to the 2024 bankruptcy. [S28]\n\nAlso, the 2024 filing after securing $100M in financing but still needing bankruptcy. But the question is about factors leading to it, so the rent is a key factor. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate <statement> tag with proper citations. Also, check if other sentences are relevant. For example, the sale/leaseback in S27 is part of the financial commitments. \n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Red Lobster's 2024 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was influenced by prior ownership changes and financial commitments. The company was acquired by Golden Gate Capital in 2014 and later fully purchased by Thai Union in 2020, which may have impacted its financial strategies.<cite>[S3][S4]</cite></statement>\n<statement>The sale/leaseback of real estate in 2014 to American Realty Capital Partners for $1.5 billion led to significant annual rent payments, which totaled $200 million per year by 2023 and contributed to the 2024 bankruptcy filing.<cite>[S27][S28]</cite></statement>\n\nThat should cover the factors. I need to check if there are other sentences. The user's question also asks how prior ownership changes and financial commitments played a role. The answer should link the ownership changes to the financial commitments. The sale/leaseback is part of the financial commitments from the ownership change. So the two statements above should suffice."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Red Lobster's expansion and exit from specific markets like Quebec and their current presence in Canada. I need to use the provided supporting context to answer this.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the passage for mentions of Quebec and Canada. In the history section, there's a sentence that says Red Lobster exited the Quebec market in September 1997 due to financial losses. That's S14 and S15. Also, it mentions that they were absent from the Maritime provinces, BC, and Arctic territories. \n\nThen, looking at the current presence in Canada, there's a part that states currently Red Lobster has between 25-30 locations in Canada, mostly in Ontario's larger cities and some in the Prairie provinces. That's S14. \n\nThe user also wants to know how the expansion and exit reflect strategic decisions. The exit from Quebec was due to financial losses, which suggests that they made a strategic decision to leave markets that weren't profitable. The expansion into Canada in the 80s by buying Ponderosa locations shows their growth strategy. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited properly. For example, the exit from Quebec is in S15, and the current presence is S14. Also, the expansion into Canada in the 80s is mentioned in S13. \n\nWait, the question also asks about the current presence. The passage says \"Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada...\" which is S14. So that's the current presence. \n\nI should structure the answer by first addressing the expansion and exit, citing the relevant sentences, then the current presence. Make sure each sentence has the correct citations. Also, check if there are any other sentences that might be relevant. For example, the bankruptcy in 2024 might affect current presence, but the passage doesn't mention any changes after the 2024 filing. The current presence is stated before the bankruptcy, so it's still valid unless the bankruptcy affected it, but the passage doesn't specify that. So stick with the info given."

    "[S29] On August 6, 2014, Red Lobster announced its new headquarters location in CNL Center City Commons in Orlando. [S30] On March 6, 2015, Red Lobster officially opened the Restaurant Support Center. [S31] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million, and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC. [S32] ### Restructuring and bankruptcy\n\nIn March 2024, Jonathan Tibus was hired as the company's new CEO. [S33] Tibus previously was CEO during the bankruptcy of Kona Grill and the chief restructuring officer of Krystal. [S34] Officials deemed Red Lobster as a \"zombie brand\" and said that they were exploring options to save the company, including a restructuring turnaround, fire sale, or a possible bankruptcy filing. [S35] Red Lobster also announced that it was searching for a new buyer, and if one could not be found, the company may file for bankruptcy within the coming months. [S36] On April 16, 2024, Bloomberg reported that Red Lobster was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting leases and labor costs among the issues. [S37] The company plans to exit some underperforming leases as well as address other long-term contracts and rising labor costs. [S38] The company expected to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy procedure while discussing a possible bankruptcy debt reduction plan with its creditors. [S39] On May 13, 2024, Red Lobster abruptly closed some restaurants in 28 states. [S40] This included all of its Buffalo-area locations and most of its Orlando-area locations. [S41] TAGeX Brands conducted liquidation auctions for restaurant fixtures and supplies at the closed locations and concluded them by May 16. [S42] On May 14, 2024, Red Lobster announced that it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before Memorial Day weekend, planning to restructure agreements with its landlords and creditors in efforts to shed some of its debt. [S43] On May 20, 2024, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after securing over $100 million in financing commitments from its lenders. [S44] The company has also entered a stalking horse agreement to sell itself and have its lenders manage it, which will allow for the company to receive financing and shed some of its $1 billion debt. [S45] On May 23, 2024, Red Lobster announced that their Canadian operations would also be declaring bankruptcy by no later than May 28. [S46] The company will close some underperforming Canadian locations during the proceedings. [S47] On June 6, 2024, Red Lobster announced that if their bankruptcy plan ends up getting approved, up to 129 additional locations would be permanently shut down. [S48] One of these locations included their restaurant at Times Square in Manhattan. [S49] On June 12, hip hop rapper Flavor Flav was hired by the company to be the spokesperson of Red Lobster commercials, after he previously ordered the entire Red Lobster menu in order to save the company. [S50] In his first commercial, he would announce that CrabFest would be returning to restaurants nationwide. [S51] On June 14, it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by the Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens, was interested in saving Red Lobster out of bankruptcy. [S52] The company evaluated which regions would fit Red Lobster's attempted comeback and revival. [S53] That same day, Red Lobster Canada announced that it would ask the Ontario court to recognize its stalking horse bid and approve a sales process as soon as next week. [S54] This procedure would allow the company to preserve their operations in Canada, as the bid would allow for lenders avoid the risk of assets being sold for a lower price. [S55] On June 18, an Ontario court approved the sale procedure for Red Lobster Canada. [S56] On August 25, 2024, Red Lobster announced the closure of 23 additional restaurants, all of which were set to be shuttered by August 31. [S57] On August 26, Damola Adamolekun was appointed CEO of Red Lobster, replacing Tibus.",
    "[S58] On September 5, 2024, a court approved Red Lobster's bankruptcy plan. [S59] RL Investor Holdings, a private group of investors consisted of TCW Private Credit, Blue Torch and funds managed by Fortress Investment Group, acquired the company after court approval on September 16. [S60] Red Lobster officially exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy that day. [S61] ## Promotions\n\nIn 2003, Red Lobster offered an endless snow crab leg promotion, the second in its history. [S62] The promotion resulted in its parent company, Darden Restaurants, taking a $3 million charge to third-quarter earnings, resulting in president Edna Morris's departure from the company. [S63] The ill-timed promotion was launched amid high wholesale crab leg prices. [S64] The chain also underestimated how many times a customer would order more. [S65] Further complicating matters at the restaurant level was the time customers spent table-side in the restaurant cracking crab legs. [S66] This resulted in increased waiting times in the lobby and overall diminished customer capacity per hour. [S67] Red Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals. [S68] In June 2023, Red Lobster reintroduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp, normally run as a limited-time promotion during autumn, as a permanent addition to their menu. [S69] For $20, guests could order two shrimp dishes to start, and keep ordering until they were full. [S70] This resulted in a $11 million loss for Red Lobster in its third quarter earnings for that year, as the company underestimated the amount of customers taking advantage of a deal that had low profit margins. [S71] In response, Red Lobster raised the prices on the deal twice, from $20 to $22, and then to $25. [S72] ## Menu\n\nThe brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp. [S73] It also serves chicken, desserts, pasta, and steak.\u1d56\u02b3\u1d52\u1d50\u1d52\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f\u1d43\u02e1 \u02e2\u1d52\u1d58\u02b3\u1d9c\u1d49? [S74] ### Lobster bisque controversy\n\nIn February 2016, *Inside Edition* reported that Red Lobster used a mix of less expensive langostino along with Maine lobster in its lobster bisque recipe. [S75] ## Locations\n\nAs of February 13, 2025, the company had 514 locations worldwide. [S76] These locations span 44 US states, Canada, Ecuador, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. [S77] ## In popular culture\n\nIn 2007, writer Stewart O'Nan published the novella *Last Night at the Lobster* about the closing of a Red Lobster restaurant in Connecticut. [S78] In February 2016, singer Beyonc\u00e9 referenced Red Lobster in her single \"Formation\". [S79] After unexpectedly releasing the single and performing it during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, Red Lobster reported a 33% sales increase."
