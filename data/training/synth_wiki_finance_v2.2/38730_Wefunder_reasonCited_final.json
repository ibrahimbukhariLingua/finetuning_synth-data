      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Wefunder's foundation reflects both its regulatory compliance and philosophical approach to investment accessibility. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that Wefunder was founded in 2012 by three people and was backed by Y Combinator. The key points here are the regulatory part and the philosophy.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S2] talks about the JOBS Act provision allowing unaccredited investors to buy equity. That's definitely regulatory compliance. Then [S4] states that Wefunder is based on the idea that anyone, regardless of wealth, can invest. That's the philosophical approach towards accessibility.\n\nSo the foundation's reflection would be in these two aspects. The answer should connect the regulatory compliance (JOBS Act) with the philosophical idea of accessibility. The citations needed are [S2] and [S4]. I need to make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Let me structure the statements accordingly."
