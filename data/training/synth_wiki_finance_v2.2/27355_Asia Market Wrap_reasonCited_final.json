      "answer": "<statement>Initially, Martin Soong was the regular presenter of *Asia Market Wrap*, as noted in the passage stating, \"Prior to Martin Soong's original departure from CNBC Asia, he was the programme's regular presenter (the programme was billed as *Asia Market Wrap with Martin Soong*)\". This established his role as the primary anchor during his tenure from 1998\u20132003.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement> <statement>The transition occurred when Soong left to present *Asia Squawk Box*, prompting Christine Tan to take over as the anchor. The passage specifies, \"When he returned to present *Asia Squawk Box*, Tan was moved to present *Asia Market Wrap* instead,\" marking the shift in anchoring roles.<cite>[S7]</cite></statement> <statement>Christine Tan's tenure as anchor lasted from 2004\u20132005, as listed in the passage under \"Asia Market Wrap anchors,\" which notes her role during that period.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the anchoring roles of Christine Tan and Martin Soong evolved during the program's run and what triggered the transition between their tenures.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me go through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with the passage. Sentence S1 introduces the program \"Asia Market Wrap.\" S2 mentions the show's air times. S3 says it was anchored by Christine Tan, so that's where she comes in. S4 talks about the program's origin and segments. S5 mentions \"Asia Market Week,\" but not sure if that's relevant here. S6 states that prior to Martin Soong's departure, he was the regular presenter, so he was there before. Then S7 says when he returned to present \"Asia Squawk Box,\" Tan was moved to present \"Asia Market Wrap.\" So that's the transition. S8 and S9 are about the program ending. S10 mentions Tan continuing as the Asian presenter, but later anchors. S11 lists the anchors, showing Martin Soong was from 1998-2003, Christine Tan 2004-2005.\n\nSo the evolution: Martin Soong was the original anchor, then Christine Tan took over. The transition was triggered when Martin Soong left to present another show, \"Asia Squawk Box,\" which allowed Tan to move into the main anchor role. The context also mentions that after Tan's tenure, the program ended and was replaced. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The part about Martin Soong being the regular presenter before his departure is S6. The transition when he returned to \"Asia Squawk Box\" is S7. Christine Tan's tenure is mentioned in S3 and S11. The end of the program is S9. \n\nSo the answer should state that Martin Soong was the original anchor, then Christine Tan took over when he left for another show. The transition was triggered by Soong's move to \"Asia Squawk Box,\" as per S7. The evolution is from Soong to Tan, with their respective tenures listed in S11. \n\nI need to structure the sentences with proper citations. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Also, check if there are any other sentences that might be relevant. For example, S6 mentions prior to his departure, he was the regular presenter, so that's when he was anchoring. Then S7 is when he returned to another show, leading to Tan's move. \n\nSo the answer would have two statements: one about Soong's role and the transition, citing S6 and S7, and another about Tan's role, citing S3 and S11. Also, mention the end of the program in S9 if needed, but the question is about their roles during the run, not the end. \n\nWait, the question is about the evolution during the program's run. So the transition between their tenures is key. So the answer should explain that Martin Soong was the original anchor, then Christine Tan took over when he left, and the trigger was his move to another show. The citations would be S6 and S7 for the transition, and S11 for their tenures."

The user is asking about the timeline of Asia Market Wrap's termination and the replacement program, as well as the anchors in its final phase.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with the passage: \n\n[S1] introduces Asia Market Wrap as a program on CNBC Asia until December 2005. [S9] mentions that the program ended on 2 December 2005 and was replaced by Worldwide Exchange on 19 December 2005. That gives the timeline. \n\nFor the replacement program, [S9] says it was replaced by Worldwide Exchange. \n\nNow, the anchors in the final phase. [S11] lists the anchors. Christine Tan is listed from 2004-2005. Then [S10] mentions that Tan continued as the Asian presenter of the new program (Worldwide Exchange) joined by Michelle Caruso-Cabrera and later Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate. But the question is about the final phase of Asia Market Wrap, not the replacement. So the final anchors would be Christine Tan, as per [S11], and maybe others mentioned in [S3] and [S7]. \n\nWait, [S3] says it was anchored by Christine Tan. [S7] mentions that when Martin Soong returned to present Asia Squawk Box, Tan was moved to present Asia Market Wrap. So in the final phase, Christine Tan was the anchor. Also, [S11] lists her as 2004-2005. \n\nSo the timeline is ending on 2 Dec 2005, replaced by Worldwide Exchange on 19 Dec 2005. Anchors in the final phase: Christine Tan. But [S10] mentions that after the replacement, Tan continued with the new program, but the question is about the final phase of Asia Market Wrap, so probably just Christine Tan. \n\nWait, but [S11] lists Bill Hartley and Lorraine Hahn as 1996-1998, Martin Soong 1998-2003, Christine Tan 2004-2005. So her tenure was until 2005, which aligns with the end date. So the final anchors would be Christine Tan. \n\nBut the user might also want to know if there were others. The question says \"anchors involved in its final phase.\" So maybe during the last period before termination, was there a change? [S7] says when Martin Soong returned, Tan was moved to present Asia Market Wrap. So maybe Martin Soong was involved earlier, but in the final phase, it's Christine Tan. \n\nSo the answer would be that the program ended on 2 Dec 2005, replaced by Worldwide Exchange on 19 Dec 2005. The final anchors were Christine Tan. \n\nNow, citations: The end date is [S9], replacement program is [S9]. The anchors are in [S11] and [S3]. But [S3] says it was anchored by Christine Tan, and [S11] lists her as 2004-2005. So the anchors in the final phase would be cited from [S3] and [S11]. \n\nWait, the user might also want to know if there were other anchors in the final phase. The passage doesn't mention any other anchors after Christine Tan in the context given. So the answer would be Christine Tan as the final anchor. \n\nSo the statements would be:\n\n- The timeline of termination is ending on 2 Dec 2005, replaced by Worldwide Exchange on 19 Dec 2005. [S9]\n- The replacement program is Worldwide Exchange. [S9]\n- The anchors in the final phase were Christine Tan. [S3][S11]\n\nBut need to check if [S10] is relevant. [S10] talks about the replacement program's anchors, not the original. So maybe not. \n\nSo the final answer would have three statements: one about the end date, one about the replacement, and one about the anchors. Each with their citations."

The passage mentions several segments. Let me go through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at sentence S4: It says the program included segments like Australia Market Wrap, China Business Briefing, and Eye on India. That's a direct answer to the first part about specific segments. So I should note those three segments.\n\nNext, the second part of the question is about how the structure reflected the focus on regional financial markets. The passage mentions that the show examined day's headlines and numbers with in-depth analysis, interviewing experts. Also, there's a weekly wrap-up called Asia Market Week.

Sentence S3 talks about in-depth analysis and interviews, which contributes to the structure. Sentence S5 mentions Asia Market Week as a weekly segment, which is part of the structure.
