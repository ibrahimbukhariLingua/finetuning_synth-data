      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Cities Alliance\n\n\n# Cities Alliance\n\n\n\n**Cities Alliance** is a global partnership fighting urban poverty and supporting cities to deliver sustainable development. [S2] To manage its activities, the Cities Alliance operates a multi-donor fund with UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), as host and trustee. [S3] Different members provide direction, financing and advocacy. [S4] Cities Alliance aims to deliver solutions to urban poverty. [S5] ## Overview\n\nFounded in 1999 at the conclusion of the International Mayors Summit, the Cities Alliance's initial members were bilateral aid agencies from the US, Japan, Germany, the UK, and Canada, in addition to four associations of local authorities. [S6] From its inception, the Cities Alliance has been clear in its intention to exclusively \"fund partnership-efforts of multiple stakeholders\", with the intention of engendering cooperation across the government, NGO, international organization, and citizen advocacy divides to support active local governance, citizenship, and economic growth These efforts implicate \"regional staff members in Africa, Asia, and Latin America\". [S7] The Cities Alliance has additionally \"made transparency and access to information an important aspect of its decision-making process\" in accordance with principle five of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. [S8] This is one of several ways in which the Cities Alliance is in line with current thinking on the subject. [S9] Through their country programmes, for instance, they are strengthening \"a framework to enhance cooperation between urban stakeholders, and public and private investments in urban communities\", echoing the Paris Declaration's themes of harmonisation, alignment, and ownership. [S10] In addition to grant distribution and monitoring efforts, the Cities Alliance also serves as \"a medium for information and experience sharing between various local governments\", to encourage the development of best practices in urban planning, mapping, and service delivery, with knowledge exchanges taking place in various fora. [S11] It was this same coordinating function that prompted the Cities Alliance Secretariat's location, first in Washington DC and then in Brussels, in order \"to encourage close coordination between the technical assistance role to be promoted by the Cities Alliance\" with the larger \"urban project lending\" function. [S12] This move, from Washington DC to Brussels in 2013, corresponded with the departure of the Cities Alliance from the World Bank, at which point it fell under the auspices of the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), following a \"partnership-driven selection process\" to make it their secretariat and trustee. [S13] ## Practices\n\nThe basic practices of the Cities Alliance were outlined in their 2003 annual report, calling for \"an attack on urban poverty by focusing on two areas: city development strategy (CDS), and citywide and nationwide squatter settlement upgrading\". [S14] This has since expanded to include other modalities but still forms the bedrock of Cities Alliance, which focuses on \"the city and its region rather than on sectors\", making it relatively unusual.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significant achievements of the Cities Alliance and how they reflect its commitment to urban poverty reduction. I need to look through the provided passage and pick out the key achievements mentioned.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of achievements. In Passage 1, there's a section titled \"Accomplishments\" in Passage 2. Let me check that. \n\nLooking at the sentences under \"Accomplishments\": [S39] mentions that the Cities Alliance has been credited with several major developments in urban innovation since inception. Then [S40] talks about the \"Cities Without Slums Action Plan\" launched by Nelson Mandela, which set targets for improving slum dwellers' conditions by 2020. [S41] states this was endorsed at the UN Millennium Summit and is part of the Millennium Development Goals. [S42] mentions a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2009 for slum upgrading in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Uganda. [S43] lists programs like urban forums and Land, Services and Citizenship programs. [S44] explains the Land, Services and Citizenship program's goals in Ghana and Vietnam.\n\nAlso, in Passage 1, there's mention of the Cities Alliance's focus on city development strategies and squatter settlement upgrading since 2003 [S13][S14]. Their work aligns with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness [S7][S9]. They promote transparency and information sharing [S7][S10]. \n\nNow, how do these reflect commitment to urban poverty reduction? The slum upgrading initiatives, the action plan linked to MDGs, grants for specific countries, and programs that involve local governance and community participation all target urban poverty. The collaboration with various stakeholders and focus on sustainable development also tie into reducing poverty.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each achievement and cite the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check for any other relevant points. For example, the multi-donor fund and coordination between stakeholders [S2][S6][S12] might also be part of their approach, but the question is about achievements, so maybe focus on the specific programs and outcomes mentioned in the accomplishments section.\n\nSo the key achievements are the Cities Without Slums Action Plan, the Millennium Development Goals alignment, the Gates Foundation grant, and the Land, Services and Citizenship programs. Also, their initial focus on city development strategies and squatter settlement upgrading. Each of these should be mentioned with their citations."

      "answer": "<statement>The purpose of the Cities Alliance' s country programmes is to serve as a framework for longer-term, programmatic support, involving national and local governments, urban poor communities, investors, and partners to fund projects. This is described as the \"fulcrum of its work program\" to address urban challenges systematically.<cite>[S23]</cite></statement> <statement>In the Uganda example, this purpose is demonstrated by targeting areas with significant urbanization and extreme challenges, such as capacity constraints, infrastructure backlogs, and affordability issues, to address critical urban development needs through focused projects.<cite>[S25]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S16] City Development Strategies (CDS) are positioned \"as a mechanism to create a shared vision of the city's future among all stakeholders\". [S17] They are \"based on an assessment of each city's economic growth prospects and are aimed at enhancing its competitiveness\" and focus on \"improved urban governance, fiscal responsibility and the establishment for clear priorities for action and investment\". [S18] One prominent example of a Cities Alliance CDS programme can be found in the Philippines. [S19] In 1999, the \"World Bank/Japan, concurrent with UNDP/ UN-HABITAT\" supported the development of CDS in three cities. [S20] Subsequently, \"the Municipal League of the Philippines\" expanded the project \"to many more cities than initially included\", due to the CDS\u2019 capacity to aid leaders in understanding \"the economic development of the city\" and removing \"constraints to its efficient functioning\" to raise living standards of its citizens.

[S23] They are a framework, including \"national and local governments, urban poor communities, Cities Alliance members, investors and other partners\" and funding for projects. [S24] In their Uganda Country Programme, for instance, projects are targeted \"not only where the bulk of urbanization is taking place, but also where capacity constraints, infrastructure backlogs, and affordability challenges are the most extreme\". [S25] ### Catalytic Fund\n\nThe Catalytic Fund of the Cities Alliance is a fund for small grants ($50,000 to $200,000), intended to \"catalyse urban transformation processes that promote inclusive cities\" and advance collective knowledge \"through learning distilled from project experiences\" and are issued along selected themes.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the purpose of the Cities Alliance' s country programmes and how that's shown in the Uganda example. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections. The \"Country programmes\" section is probably where the answer lies. Let me check that part.\n\nLooking at the supporting context, under \"Country programmes\", it says: \"Country programmes are considered the 'fulcrum of its work program to longer-term, programmatic support'. They are a framework, including 'national and local governments, urban poor communities, Cities Alliance members, investors and other partners' and funding for projects.\" So the purpose here is to provide longer-term, programmatic support through a framework involving various stakeholders and funding.\n\nThen, the Uganda example is mentioned: \"In their Uganda Country Programme, for instance, projects are targeted 'not only where the bulk of urbanization is taking place, but also where capacity constraints, infrastructure backlogs, and affordability challenges are the most extreme'.\" This shows that the purpose is demonstrated by focusing on areas with significant urbanization and severe challenges, aiming to address those through targeted projects.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other parts of the context that mention the purpose. The other sections like Slum upgrading, Catalytic Fund, and Advocacy might not be directly relevant here. The answer should tie the purpose stated in the Country programmes section to the Uganda example. \n\nSo the purpose is the framework for long-term support with stakeholders and funding. The Uganda example demonstrates this by targeting areas with high urbanization and severe issues. The citations would be [S23] and [S25] for the purpose and the Uganda example respectively. Let me check the sentence numbers again to confirm. Yes, [S23] is about country programmes being the fulcrum, and [S25] is the Uganda example. \n\nI need to structure the answer with two statements. The first statement explains the purpose with citation [S23], and the second statement explains the Uganda example with [S25].

[S19] In 1999, the \"World Bank/Japan, concurrent with UNDP/ UN-HABITAT\" supported the development of CDS in three cities. [S20] Subsequently, \"the Municipal League of the Philippines\" expanded the project \"to many more cities than initially included\", due to the CDS\u2019 capacity to aid leaders in understanding \"the economic development of the city\" and removing \"constraints to its efficient functioning\" to raise living standards of its citizens. [S21] ### Slum upgrading\n\nSlum upgrading, or the delivering of \"a package of basic services: clean water supply and adequate sewage disposal to improve the well-being of the community\" and \"legalizing and \u2018regularizing\u2019 the properties in situations of insecure or unclear tenure\" was, and continues to be, one of the first focuses of the Cities Alliance. [S22] Prominent slum upgrading projects undertaken by the Cities Alliance include:\n\n* A Community-Led Infrastructure Financing Facility in Mumbai\n* The Shelter Finance for the Poor Initiative in Peru, India, Mexico, Ecuador, and Kenya,\n* A National Slum Upgrading Strategy in the Philippines\n* The Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project (VUUP)\n* Barrio Legal Programme in S\u00e3o Paulo\n* National Upgrading Support Program (NUSP) in South Africa\n\n### Country programmes\n\nCountry programmes are considered the \"fulcrum of its work program to longer-term, programmatic support\". [S23] They are a framework, including \"national and local governments, urban poor communities, Cities Alliance members, investors and other partners\" and funding for projects. [S24] In their Uganda Country Programme, for instance, projects are targeted \"not only where the bulk of urbanization is taking place, but also where capacity constraints, infrastructure backlogs, and affordability challenges are the most extreme\". [S25] ### Catalytic Fund\n\nThe Catalytic Fund of the Cities Alliance is a fund for small grants ($50,000 to $200,000), intended to \"catalyse urban transformation processes that promote inclusive cities\" and advance collective knowledge \"through learning distilled from project experiences\" and are issued along selected themes. [S26] The themes in question vary, but in years past, they have included \"Know Your City\" and \"Youth and the City\". [S27] ### Advocacy\n\nThe Cities Alliance has had several high-profile advocates in its history, including:",
        "[S46] * French Development Agency (AFD)\n* AVSI Foundation (AVSI)\n* Bundesministerium f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)\n* Brazil's Minist\u00e9rio Das Cidades\n* Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal (CAIXA)\n* Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)\n* The Department for International Development (DFID)\n* Ethiopian Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction\n* The German Organisation for International Cooperation (GIZ)\n* Habitat for Humanity International\n* Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC)\n* Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS)\n* Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI)\n* KfW (KfW)\n* League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP)\n* The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Economic Development (MAEDI)\n* The World Association of Major Metropolises (Metropolis)\n* Department for International Cooperation and Policy Support (MINVU)\n* Nigeria Ministry of Works, Housing and Urban Development\n* Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Omidyar Network\n* State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)\n* Slum Dwellers International (SDI)\n* Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)\n* South African Department of Human Settlements\n* The Ford Foundation\n* United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)\n* United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)\n* United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\n* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n* United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat)\n* United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)\n* Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO)\n* World Bank\n\nProfessor Thuli Madonsela of South Africa was appointed as Chair of the Board in 2022."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the types of projects the Catalytic Fund supports and the themes emphasized in past initiatives. \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant sections in the provided passage. The passage has several sections, so I'll scan through them. The \"Catalytic Fund\" section is mentioned in Passage 1, specifically sentences [S26] and [S27]. \n\nLooking at [S26], it says the Catalytic Fund provides small grants ($50k-$200k) to catalyze urban transformation for inclusive cities and advance knowledge through project experiences. It also mentions that grants are issued along selected themes. Then [S27] states that themes vary but past ones include \"Know Your City\" and \"Youth and the City\".\n\nSo the answer should mention the types of projects as small grants aimed at urban transformation and inclusive cities, and the themes like \"Know Your City\" and \"Youth and the City\". The citations would be [S26] and [S27]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in the passage about the Catalytic Fund. The rest of the passage talks about other topics like City Development Strategies, Slum Upgrading, Country Programmes, and Advocacy, which aren't directly relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be structured with two statements: one explaining the types of projects and another listing the themes, each with their respective citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which types of organizations are involved in the Cities Alliance's partnerships, based on the provided list. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context given. The passage has two parts. Passage 1 talks about different initiatives like City Development Strategies, slum upgrading, country programs, the Catalytic Fund, and advocacy. But the specific list of organizations is in Passage 2, which starts at [S46]. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a list of organizations. Let me go through each item:\n\n- French Development Agency (AFD)\n- AVSI Foundation (AVSI)\n- Bundesministerium f\u00fcr wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (BMZ)\n- Brazil's Minist\u00e9rio Das Cidades\n- Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal (CAIXA)\n- Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)\n- The Department for International Development (DFID)\n- Ethiopian Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction\n- The German Organisation for International Cooperation (GIZ)\n- Habitat for Humanity International\n- Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC)\n- Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS)\n- Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI)\n- KfW (KfW)\n- League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP)\n- The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Economic Development (MAEDI)\n- The World Association of Major Metropolises (Metropolis)\n- Department for International Cooperation and Policy Support (MINVU)\n- Nigeria Ministry of Works, Housing and Urban Development\n- Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n- Omidyar Network\n- State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)\n- Slum Dwellers International (SDI)\n- Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)\n- South African Department of Human Settlements\n- The Ford Foundation\n- United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)\n- United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)\n- United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\n- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n- United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat)\n- United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)\n- Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO)\n- World Bank\n\nNow, I need to categorize these into types. Let's see:\n\n1. **Government Agencies**: Many entries are ministries or departments, like Brazil's Minist\u00e9rio Das Cidades, Ethiopian Ministry, etc. Also, the World Bank is an international financial institution, but sometimes considered a governmental body.\n\n2. **International Organizations**: UN agencies like UNDP, UN-Habitat, UNEP, UNICEF, etc. Also, the World Bank and IMF (though not listed here, but World Bank is here).\n\n3. **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**: Habitat for Humanity, AVSI Foundation, Slum Dwellers International (SDI), WIEGO, The Ford Foundation.\n\n4. **Local Governments**: League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF).\n\n5. **Financial Institutions**: KfW, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal (CAIXA), DFID (Department for International Development), which is a UK government agency but also a financial body. Also, the French Development Agency (AFD) and others like GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation).\n\n6. **Private Sector or Foundations**: Omidyar Network, which is a philanthropy organization. The Ford Foundation is also a foundation.\n\nWait, but the question is about the types of organizations involved. So I need to group these entries into categories. Let me check the passage again to see if there are any mentions of types. \n\nIn Passage 1, under \"Country programmes,\" it mentions \"national and local governments, urban poor communities, Cities Alliance members, investors and other partners.\" So that gives some types: governments, local governments, investors, partners. But the specific list in Passage 2 includes more detailed organizations.\n\nSo the answer should list the types based on the organizations in the list. Let me categorize each entry:\n\n- Government agencies (ministries, departments)\n- International organizations (UN agencies, World Bank)\n- NGOs and foundations\n- Local governments and city networks\n- Financial institutions and development banks\n- Private sector entities (though fewer here)\n\nBut the exact types as per the list would be:\n\n- National governments (e.g., Brazil's Minist\u00e9rio Das Cidades, Ethiopian Ministry, etc.)\n- Local governments (ICLEI, LCP)\n- International organizations (UNDP, UN-Habitat, etc.)\n- NGOs (Habitat for Humanity, AVSI, SDI, WIEGO)\n- Financial institutions (World Bank, KfW, AFD, GIZ, DFID, etc.)\n- Foundations (Ford Foundation, Omidyar Network)\n- Multilateral agencies (like the World Bank, UN agencies)\n\nBut the question is asking for the types, not the specific names. So the answer should list the types as per the organizations in the list. The user wants the types, not the specific names. However, the instructions say to use the supporting context to answer. The supporting context's Passage 2 lists the organizations, so the answer should be derived from that list.\n\nSo the types would be:\n\n- Government agencies (national and local)\n- International organizations (UN agencies, World Bank)\n- Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\n- Local government networks\n- Financial institutions and development banks\n- Foundations and philanthropic organizations\n- Multilateral development banks\n\nBut I need to check if the passage explicitly mentions these types. For example, in Passage 1, under country programs, it mentions \"national and local governments, urban poor communities, Cities Alliance members, investors and other partners.\" So the types here are:\n\n- National and local governments\n- Urban poor communities (but not sure if that's an organization type)\n- Investors (financial institutions)\n- Other partners (which could include NGOs, international organizations, etc.)\n\nBut the specific list in Passage 2 includes the actual organizations. So the answer should list the types based on that list. For example:\n\n- Government agencies (e.g., ministries, departments)\n- International organizations (UN agencies, World Bank)\n- NGOs and foundations\n- Local governments and city networks\n- Financial institutions (development banks, etc.)\n\nSo the answer would be these types. Now, I need to make sure that each type is supported by the list in Passage 2. For example, \"national governments\" are present (Brazil's Minist\u00e9rio Das Cidades, etc.), \"local governments\" (ICLEI, LCP), \"international organizations\" (UNDP, UN-Habitat, etc.), \"NGOs\" (Habitat for Humanity, AVSI, SDI), \"financial institutions\" (World Bank, KfW, AFD, DFID, GIZ), \"foundations\" (Ford Foundation, Omidyar Network).\n\nTherefore, the answer should list these types, citing the relevant sentences from Passage 2. However, the user's question is about the types of organizations involved, so the answer should be a list of the types, each supported by the organizations in the list. But the instructions say to answer with statements and citations. So each sentence in the answer should mention a type and cite the relevant organizations from the list. But the user might expect a concise list of types, each with citations.\n\nBut the response format requires each sentence to be in <statement> tags with citations. So perhaps the answer would be multiple statements, each stating a type and citing the relevant organizations. However, since the list in Passage 2 is extensive, it's possible that each type is mentioned in the list, but the user might want the types categorized.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be a list of the types, each with a citation to the list in Passage 2. But the exact instruction is to answer the question using the supporting context, which includes the list. So the answer would be the types of organizations as per the list, with citations to the sentences in Passage 2 where the organizations are listed.\n\nBut the problem is that the list in Passage 2 is a single block starting at [S46], so each organization is part of that list. However, the user might expect that each type is mentioned in the passage. But the passage doesn't explicitly categorize them; it just lists them. Therefore, the answer must infer the types from the list.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n- Government agencies (e.g., ministries, departments)\n- International organizations (UN agencies, World Bank)\n- NGOs and foundations\n- Local governments and city networks\n- Financial institutions and development banks\n\nEach of these types is represented in the list. However, the citations would need to refer to the sentences where these organizations are mentioned. Since the entire list is in [S46], but each organization is part of that list. However, the user might expect that each type is cited to [S46], but the exact format requires citations to specific sentences. But the list in Passage 2 is a single sentence? Wait, looking back:\n\nPassage 2 starts with [S46] and then lists all the organizations. So the entire list is under [S46]. Therefore, each organization in the list is part of [S46]. Therefore, any statement about the types would cite [S46].\n\nBut the user's instructions say to provide citations of the sentence number. So if the answer is a list of types, each statement would cite [S46].\n\nBut the user's question is asking for the types of organizations involved, as indicated by the provided list. Therefore, the answer would be the types, each with a citation to [S46].\n\nSo the final answer would be statements listing each type, each citing [S46]."

    "[S1] Cities Alliance\n\n\n# Cities Alliance\n\n\n\n**Cities Alliance** is a global partnership fighting urban poverty and supporting cities to deliver sustainable development. [S2] To manage its activities, the Cities Alliance operates a multi-donor fund with UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), as host and trustee. [S3] Different members provide direction, financing and advocacy. [S4] Cities Alliance aims to deliver solutions to urban poverty. [S5] ## Overview\n\nFounded in 1999 at the conclusion of the International Mayors Summit, the Cities Alliance's initial members were bilateral aid agencies from the US, Japan, Germany, the UK, and Canada, in addition to four associations of local authorities. [S6] From its inception, the Cities Alliance has been clear in its intention to exclusively \"fund partnership-efforts of multiple stakeholders\", with the intention of engendering cooperation across the government, NGO, international organization, and citizen advocacy divides to support active local governance, citizenship, and economic growth These efforts implicate \"regional staff members in Africa, Asia, and Latin America\". [S7] The Cities Alliance has additionally \"made transparency and access to information an important aspect of its decision-making process\" in accordance with principle five of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. [S8] This is one of several ways in which the Cities Alliance is in line with current thinking on the subject. [S9] Through their country programmes, for instance, they are strengthening \"a framework to enhance cooperation between urban stakeholders, and public and private investments in urban communities\", echoing the Paris Declaration's themes of harmonisation, alignment, and ownership. [S10] In addition to grant distribution and monitoring efforts, the Cities Alliance also serves as \"a medium for information and experience sharing between various local governments\", to encourage the development of best practices in urban planning, mapping, and service delivery, with knowledge exchanges taking place in various fora. [S11] It was this same coordinating function that prompted the Cities Alliance Secretariat's location, first in Washington DC and then in Brussels, in order \"to encourage close coordination between the technical assistance role to be promoted by the Cities Alliance\" with the larger \"urban project lending\" function. [S12] This move, from Washington DC to Brussels in 2013, corresponded with the departure of the Cities Alliance from the World Bank, at which point it fell under the auspices of the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), following a \"partnership-driven selection process\" to make it their secretariat and trustee. [S13] ## Practices\n\nThe basic practices of the Cities Alliance were outlined in their 2003 annual report, calling for \"an attack on urban poverty by focusing on two areas: city development strategy (CDS), and citywide and nationwide squatter settlement upgrading\". [S14] This has since expanded to include other modalities but still forms the bedrock of Cities Alliance, which focuses on \"the city and its region rather than on sectors\", making it relatively unusual. [S15] ### City Development Strategies",
    "[S16] City Development Strategies (CDS) are positioned \"as a mechanism to create a shared vision of the city's future among all stakeholders\". [S17] They are \"based on an assessment of each city's economic growth prospects and are aimed at enhancing its competitiveness\" and focus on \"improved urban governance, fiscal responsibility and the establishment for clear priorities for action and investment\". [S18] One prominent example of a Cities Alliance CDS programme can be found in the Philippines. [S19] In 1999, the \"World Bank/Japan, concurrent with UNDP/ UN-HABITAT\" supported the development of CDS in three cities. [S20] Subsequently, \"the Municipal League of the Philippines\" expanded the project \"to many more cities than initially included\", due to the CDS\u2019 capacity to aid leaders in understanding \"the economic development of the city\" and removing \"constraints to its efficient functioning\" to raise living standards of its citizens. [S21] ### Slum upgrading\n\nSlum upgrading, or the delivering of \"a package of basic services: clean water supply and adequate sewage disposal to improve the well-being of the community\" and \"legalizing and \u2018regularizing\u2019 the properties in situations of insecure or unclear tenure\" was, and continues to be, one of the first focuses of the Cities Alliance. [S22] Prominent slum upgrading projects undertaken by the Cities Alliance include:\n\n* A Community-Led Infrastructure Financing Facility in Mumbai\n* The Shelter Finance for the Poor Initiative in Peru, India, Mexico, Ecuador, and Kenya,\n* A National Slum Upgrading Strategy in the Philippines\n* The Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project (VUUP)\n* Barrio Legal Programme in S\u00e3o Paulo\n* National Upgrading Support Program (NUSP) in South Africa\n\n### Country programmes\n\nCountry programmes are considered the \"fulcrum of its work program to longer-term, programmatic support\". [S23] They are a framework, including \"national and local governments, urban poor communities, Cities Alliance members, investors and other partners\" and funding for projects. [S24] In their Uganda Country Programme, for instance, projects are targeted \"not only where the bulk of urbanization is taking place, but also where capacity constraints, infrastructure backlogs, and affordability challenges are the most extreme\". [S25] ### Catalytic Fund\n\nThe Catalytic Fund of the Cities Alliance is a fund for small grants ($50,000 to $200,000), intended to \"catalyse urban transformation processes that promote inclusive cities\" and advance collective knowledge \"through learning distilled from project experiences\" and are issued along selected themes. [S26] The themes in question vary, but in years past, they have included \"Know Your City\" and \"Youth and the City\". [S27] ### Advocacy\n\nThe Cities Alliance has had several high-profile advocates in its history, including:",
    "[S28] * Clare Short: A British politician, Short has been a member of the Cities Alliance's policy arm since 2006. [S29] * Sheela Patel: The founder of the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers (SPARC) is an alumna of the policy arm, stepping away from her position in 2007. [S30] * Mary Houghton: The co-founder of ShoreBank, Houghten is reportedly a former member of the Policy Advisory Board from 2001 until 2004. [S31] * Somsook Boonyabancha: The Cities Alliance website lists the Secretary General of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights (ACHR) as having been active in the Policy Advisory Board from 2001 until 2004. [S32] * Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi: The Secretary General of the UCLG \u2013 Africa is also a member of the Cities Alliance Policy Advisory Board. [S33] * Richard Webb Duarte: The ex-president of the Peruvian Central Bank participated in the Policy Advisory Board. [S34] * Juanita Amatong: The former Philippine Secretary of Finance was also a member of the Policy Advisory Board. [S35] * Paulo Teixeira: This member of the Brazilian National Congress contributed to the Policy Advisory Board. [S36] * Nicephore Soglo: The former president of Benin, according to the Cities Alliance's website, began his engagement with the Policy Advisory Board in 2007. [S37] * Mark Hildebrand: The former Chief of the Technical Cooperation Division of UN-Habitat was also the manager of the Cities Alliance from 1999 until 2006. [S38] ## Accomplishments\n\nThe Cities Alliance has been credited with several major developments in the field of urban innovation, dating from its inception. [S39] \"Developed within the framework of the Cities Alliance\", the \"Cities Without Slums Action Plan\", launched by Nelson Mandela, set an agenda and targets for improving conditions \"of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020\". [S40] This was subsequently \"endorsed at the UN Millennium Summit\" and is reflected in Goal 7, Target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals. [S41] In 2009, based on its track record, the Cities Alliance was further awarded a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to continue its work on slum upgrading in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Uganda through its country programs. [S42] It has also created a number of notable programmes, including several urban forums and its Land, Services and Citizenship programmes. [S43] The latter \"aims to support national and local policy dialogue to promote sustainable urbanisation, ensure the empowerment of local governments and reinforce the importance of active community participation\" by aligning \"urban development efforts at the national, city and community levels\" in Ghana and Vietnam.
