      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the different types of coins and banknotes issued during the franga's circulation and specific actions taken regarding the 1 franga banknote and 100 franga notes in 1939.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions coins and banknotes. For coins, S3 says that between 1926 and 1938, 1, 2, and 5 franga coins were issued in silver, and 10, 20, 50, 100 franga in gold. Also, fractional pieces in lek and qindarka were issued (S4). So the coins are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 franga, plus fractional coins. But the question is about coins and banknotes. The banknotes part: S5 mentions an undated series in 1926 with 1, 5, 20, 100 franga notes. The 1 franga note was recalled shortly after (S6). Then in 1939, the 100 franga notes were overprinted during the Italian occupation (S7).\n\nSo the answer should list the coins as 1, 2, 5 franga in silver, 10, 20, 50, 100 in gold, and fractional lek and qindarka. Banknotes: 1, 5, 20, 100 franga. Then, specific actions: the 1 franga note was recalled, and the 100s were overprinted in 1939. Need to cite the relevant sentences. The 1 franga banknote recall is S6, and the 100 franga overprinting is S7. The coins are covered in S3 and S4. The banknotes are S5 and S6. So I need to structure each part with the correct citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the metal composition of franga coins across different denominations and the additional currency units issued alongside the franga.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that between 1926 and 1938, 1, 2, and 5 franga coins were made of silver. The lower values (1, 2 franga) were .835 fine, and the 5-franga coins were 900 fine. Then, the 10, 20, 50, 100 franga coins were gold at .900 fine. That answers the first part about metal composition varying by denomination.\n\nNext, the additional currency units. The passage states that fractional pieces in lek and qindarka were also issued. So, lek and qindarka are the additional units. Also, there's mention of banknotes in franga, but the question is about coins, so maybe the banknotes aren't relevant here. The user might be looking for the other units besides franga, which are lek and qindarka.\n\nNow, checking the citations. The metal composition details are in [S3]. The fractional coins in lek and qindarka are mentioned in [S4]. So the citations for the composition would be [S3], and for the additional units, [S4]. \n\nWait, the question also asks about \"additional currency units issued alongside the franga.\" The passage says \"fractional pieces denominated in lek and qindarka were also issued during the period.\" So those are the units. So the answer should mention lek and qindarka, cited from [S4].\n\nPutting it all together: The metal composition varies with silver for 1,2,5 franga and gold for 10,20,50,100. Additional units are lek and qindarka. Citations for the composition are [S3], and for the units [S4]. \n\nI need to structure each sentence with the correct citations. Make sure each statement is a separate <statement> with the right citations."
