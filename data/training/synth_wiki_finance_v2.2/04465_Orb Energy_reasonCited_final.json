      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key milestones in Orb Energy's expansion from 2006 to their operations in Africa, and how they adapted their business model in Kenya.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me go through each sentence to identify the relevant information.\n\nStarting with [S1], it mentions that Orb Energy is a solar company founded in 2006 by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in Bangalore. That's the founding, so that's a milestone. Then [S2] repeats the founding details. Maybe I should note that as the starting point.\n\n[S3] talks about the first branch in Kumta, India. That's a milestone in their early expansion. [S4] says they reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015. That's another key milestone. Then [S5] mentions starting operations in Africa in 2014. Wait, that's before the 100 branches in 2015. So the timeline is important here. \n\n[S6] states they launched a subsidiary in Kenya to replicate their Indian business model. So the adaptation in Kenya would be about setting up a subsidiary and adapting their model. But the question is about how they adapted the business model in Kenya. The passage says they \"replicate its Indian Business model in Africa,\" but does it mention any specific adaptations? The context given doesn't have more details, so maybe the answer is that they set up a subsidiary to replicate the model, but there's no info on specific adaptations. \n\nSo the key milestones would be founding in 2006, first branch in Kumta, 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015, and starting African operations in 2014 with a Kenya subsidiary. For the business model adaptation, the passage only mentions replicating the Indian model, so that's the point. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement and citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>. Check that each milestone is correctly cited. Also, ensure that the answer addresses both parts of the question: milestones and the adaptation in Kenya."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about specific details of Orb Energy's growth in Karnataka and their international expansion as mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and identify the relevant sentences. Let me go through each sentence one by one.\n\nStarting with [S1], it mentions that Orb Energy is a solar company based in Bangalore, founded by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in 2006. That's general info, not specific growth details in Karnataka or international expansion. So probably not relevant here.\n\n[S2] talks about the history, stating the founding in 2006 again. Same as above, not specific growth details.\n\n[S3] says the company opened its first branch in Kumta, India. Kumta is a place in Karnataka, I think. So that's a detail about their growth in Karnataka. But the question is about growth in Karnataka, so maybe this is relevant. But wait, the user is asking for specific details. So maybe this is a point, but I need to check if there's more.\n\n[S4] mentions that by 2015, Orb Energy reached 100 branches in Karnataka. That's a clear specific detail about their growth in Karnataka. So this is definitely a key point.\n\n[S5] states that Orb Energy started operations in Africa in 2014. That's part of their international expansion. So that's a specific detail.\n\n[S6] says they launched a subsidiary in Kenya to replicate their Indian business model in Africa. This adds more detail about their international expansion, specifically in Kenya. So both [S5] and [S6] are relevant here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the specific details about Karnataka growth are the 100 branches by 2015 (S4). For international expansion, starting in Africa in 2014 (S5) and the Kenya subsidiary (S6). The first branch in Kumta (S3) might be part of Karnataka growth, but maybe the user is looking for more significant growth metrics. However, since the question says \"specific details,\" even the first branch could count. But the user might be looking for the 100 branches as the main growth detail. Let me check the question again: \"specific details about Orb Energy's growth in Karnataka and its international expansion.\" So both the 100 branches in Karnataka and the Africa expansion with the Kenya subsidiary.\n\nSo the answer should include S4 for Karnataka's growth and S5 and S6 for international expansion. The first branch in Kumta (S3) is part of their growth in Karnataka, but maybe the user wants the 100 branches as the main detail. However, the question says \"specific details,\" so both could be included. But the answer needs to be based on what's explicitly mentioned. The passage says \"reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015\" (S4) and \"opened its first branch in Kumta, India\" (S3). Since Kumta is in Karnataka, that's a specific detail. So maybe both S3 and S4 for Karnataka. But the user might consider the 100 branches as the growth metric. However, the question is about \"growth,\" which could include both the first branch and the 100 branches. But the answer should include all explicitly mentioned details.\n\nSo the answer would have two parts: for Karnataka, S3 and S4; for international expansion, S5 and S6. But let me check the original passage again.\n\nThe passage says:\n\n[S3] The company opened its first branch in Kumta, India.\n\n[S4] The company reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015.\n\nSo both are specific details about growth in Karnataka. Then for international expansion:\n\n[S5] started operations in Africa in 2014.\n\n[S6] launched subsidiary in Kenya to replicate Indian model in Africa.\n\nSo the answer should include S3, S4, S5, S6. But the user might want the answer to list each detail with their citations. So the statement would be:\n\nOrb Energy's growth in Karnataka includes opening its first branch in Kumta, India (S3) and reaching 100 branches by 2015 (S4). For international expansion, they started operations in Africa in 2014 (S5) and established a subsidiary in Kenya (S6).\n\nBut according to the response format, each sentence should be in <statement> tags with citations. So I need to split into individual statements.\n\nSo:\n\n<statement>Orb Energy opened its first branch in Kumta, India.</statement><cite>[S3]</cite>\n\n<statement>Orb Energy reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015.</statement><cite>[S4]</cite>\n\n<statement>Orb Energy started its operations in Africa in 2014.</statement><cite>[S5]</cite>\n\n<statement>Orb Energy launched its own subsidiary in Kenya to replicate its Indian business model in Africa.</statement><cite>[S6]</cite>\n\nThat's four statements, each with their citations. The user's question asks for specific details about growth in Karnataka and international expansion. The answer should include all these points. The first branch in Kumta is a specific detail, as is the 100 branches. The international expansion details are the Africa operations and the Kenya subsidiary. So this should cover all the explicitly mentioned points."

The passage mentions that Orb Energy was founded by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in 2006. That's in sentences S1 and S2. So their role as founders is clear. The question is about their role in the early development, so founding the company would be their primary role.\n\nNext, the company's structure evolution. The passage states that they opened the first branch in Kumta (S3), reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015 (S4), started operations in Africa in 2014 (S5), and launched a subsidiary in Kenya (S6). So the structure evolved from a single branch to multiple branches in Karnataka and then expanding to Africa with a subsidiary.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is correctly cited. For the founders' roles, S1 and S2 are the relevant sentences. For the structure evolution, S3, S4, S5, S6. But each sentence should be in its own <statement> tag with appropriate citations. Also, check if any sentences are combined or need to be split. The user's example shows each sentence as a separate statement. So each of these points should be individual statements with their citations."
