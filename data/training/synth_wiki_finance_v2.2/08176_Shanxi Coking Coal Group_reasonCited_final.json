      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know how the ownership structure of Shanxi Coking Group evolved from its founding to its integration into Shanxi Coking Coal Group, and the key transactions with its subsidiaries.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.\n\nFrom Passage 1, Shanxi Coking Group was founded in 1969 as Hongtong Coking Factory. Then in 1995, a subsidiary called Shanxi Coking Company was formed to float the coke-making factory on the stock exchange. The other assets remained unlisted. In 2004, Shanxi Coking Group became a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanxi Coking Coal Group. Then in 2005, they sold a 24.19% stake in the listed company to Xishan Coal and Electricity Power, another subsidiary of Shanxi Coking Coal Group. In 2014, they received a 49% stake in Huajin Energy from the parent company, which was later sold in 2016.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, Shanxi Coking Coal Group was formed in 2001 as a holding company for Fenxi, Xishan, and Huozhou. In 2004, they became the parent of Shanxi Coking Group. Then Yuncheng Salt Group in 2012 and Shanxi Coke Group in 2013. Also, there's mention of subsidiaries like Shanxi Coking Company and Xishan Coal and Electricity Power.\n\nNow, the key transactions involving subsidiaries: the 2005 sale of 24.19% stake to Xishan Coal and Electricity Power, and the 2014 injection of 49% stake in Huajin Energy, which was later sold. Also, the integration into Shanxi Coking Coal Group in 2004. The evolution starts from being a factory, becoming a subsidiary, then part of the larger group, with various stake transfers.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each sentence citing the relevant numbers. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>. Check for all the key points: founding, 1995 subsidiary, 2004 integration, 2005 stake sale, 2014 Huajin Energy stake, and any other relevant transactions. Also, check if there are other subsidiaries mentioned that might be part of the ownership changes."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of joint ventures in Shanxi Coking Coal Group's structure and how their ownership and operations changed over time. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages for mentions of joint ventures. Let me scan through each section.\n\nIn Passage 2, under the \"History\" section, there's a mention: \"The group also formed a joint venture Huajin Coking Coal in the same year [2001].\" That's one instance. Then, looking at the \"Huajin Coking Coal\" section, it says, \"Huajin Coking Coal Co., Ltd. was incorporated in 2001 as a 50-50 joint venture of Shanxi Coking Coal Group and China Coal Energy.\" So that's a joint venture between Shanxi Coking Coal and China Coal Energy. \n\nAnother part under \"Huajin Coking Coal\" mentions that in 2011, \"Shanxi China Coal Huajin Energy\" was split from the company, but that might be a separate entity. Also, there's a note about the 49% stake in Huajin Energy being injected into Shanxi Coking Group in 2014. But the original joint venture was Huajin Coking Coal itself.\n\nNow, the question also asks about changes in ownership and operations over time. The joint venture Huajin Coking Coal was formed in 2001 as a 50-50 split. Later, in 2011, there was a split into Huajin Coking Coal and Huajin Energy, each with 51% stakes under different companies. Then in 2014, the 49% stake in Huajin Energy was transferred to Shanxi Coking Group. \n\nSo the ownership of the joint venture changed over time, with the parent company taking a larger stake. Operations might have involved coking coal production, and later splits into different entities. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The formation of the joint venture is in [S12] and [S19]. The split in 2011 is mentioned in [S19]-[S21], and the 2014 transfer in [S22]. \n\nAlso, check if there are other joint ventures. The user mentioned \"joint ventures\" in general, so maybe other subsidiaries? But the only explicit mention is Huajin Coking Coal as a joint venture. The other subsidiaries like Xishan Coal and Electricity Power are subsidiaries but not joint ventures. \n\nSo the answer should state that joint ventures, specifically Huajin Coking Coal, were formed as part of the group's structure. Ownership changed from 50-50 to Shanxi Coking Coal Group acquiring more stake over time, and operations involved coking coal and later splits into different companies."
