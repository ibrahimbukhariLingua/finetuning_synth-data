      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the organizations and committees Amaury Rivera was involved with that show his influence in both Puerto Rican and international business sectors. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage is structured with various sections like Early life, Business, Active and past board participation, etc. The key here is to identify the organizations and committees mentioned and check if they relate to Puerto Rican or international business.\n\nLooking at the \"Active and past board participation\" section. There's a mention of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, which is a Spanish bank, so that's international. Then, the Puerto Rico Products Association \u2013 that's definitely Puerto Rican. The Universal Service Committee of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Board also sounds local. \n\nThen there's the Small Business Round Table of Exports under Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown during Clinton's time \u2013 that's U.S. federal, so international. The Conference on Small Businesses of the White House, San Juan area hearings in 1996 \u2013 that's Puerto Rican. The Export Committee for the Center of Opportunities for Minority Businesses of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2013 that's international. Also, the New York State Small Business Advisory Board appointed by Cuomo \u2013 that's New York, so international as well.\n\nI need to make sure each organization is cited correctly. For example, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria is [S19], Puerto Rico Products Association [S20], Universal Service Committee [S21], Small Business Round Table [S22], Conference on Small Businesses [S23], Export Committee [S24], and New York State board [S25]. \n\nI should list each organization and the corresponding citations. Also, check if any other sections mention other organizations. The business section mentions Convergence Communications, Inc., but that's a company he worked for, not an organization or committee. The telecommunications acts might relate to committees, but the specific committees are in the board participation section.\n\nSo the answer should list each organization with their citations. Make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Also, check for any other possible mentions. The user wants influence in both sectors, so both Puerto Rican and international. The answer should reflect that."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the awards and recognitions Amaury Rivera received that highlight his achievements in marketing and business leadership. I need to go through the supporting context provided and pick out the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for sections that mention awards or recognitions. The \"Awards and recognition\" section is a good start. Let me check that part.\n\nLooking at the passage, under \"Awards and recognition,\" there are several bullet points. The first one says: \"Mexico\u2019s Best Business Executive in Marketing in 1998 by the Mexican Businessmen Chamber Association.\" That's a direct award related to marketing. The citation here is [S26].\n\nNext, \"The Caribbean Business (Puerto Rico) recognized Amaury Rivera as one of the Top Ten Business Leaders of Puerto Rico in 1997...\" This is an recognition of leadership, so that's relevant. Citation [S27].\n\nThen, \"Revista Caras\" Caras Magazine selected Rivera as the most successful young executives under 40 in 1998. This highlights his success and leadership, so that's another point. Citation [S28].\n\nAnother bullet: \"In 1995, The Young Businessman Committee of the Interamerican Business Association bestowed Rivera 'The Young Businessman of the Year' Award.\" This is an award for young business leaders, so it's relevant. Citation [S29].\n\nThere's also a mention of the Puerto Rico Legislature issuing a proclamation for his achievements as president of the Puerto Rico Products Association. However, the question specifically asks for awards and recognitions that highlight marketing and business leadership. The proclamation is more about his role in the association rather than a specific award. But maybe it's still relevant. However, since the user might be looking for formal awards, I'll check if there's a citation for that. The citation here is [S30], but looking back at the passage, the exact sentence is: \"The Puerto Rico Legislature unanimously issued a congratulatory proclamation in favor of Rivera for his achievements as president of the Puerto Rico Products Association.\" But the user's question is about marketing and business leadership. The proclamation is for his achievements in the association, which might be related but not explicitly marketing. However, since it's part of the awards section, maybe it's included. But I need to check if the user wants only the ones explicitly mentioned in the awards section. The answer should include all the awards listed there.\n\nWait, the user's question is about awards and recognitions that highlight his achievements in marketing and business leadership. So the ones mentioned in the awards section are the ones to include. Let me list them again:\n\n1. Mexico\u2019s Best Business Executive in Marketing in 1998 (S26)\n2. Top Ten Business Leaders of Puerto Rico in 1997 (S27)\n3. Most successful young executives under 40 in 1998 (S28)\n4. Young Businessman of the Year Award in 1995 (S29)\n5. Proclamation from Puerto Rico Legislature for achievements as president of the Puerto Rico Products Association (S30?)\n\nWait, the last one is in the \"Active and past board participation\" section, not the awards section. Let me check again. The user's passage has an \"Awards and recognition\" section with the bullets. The last bullet in that section is the Puerto Rico Legislature proclamation. But looking at the passage, the exact text is: \"The Puerto Rico Legislature unanimously issued a congratulatory proclamation in favor of Rivera for his achievements as president of the Puerto Rico Products Association.\" However, in the passage, that sentence is under the \"Active and past board participation\" section, not the \"Awards and recognition\" section. Wait, no, looking at the original passage:\n\nThe user's passage has a section titled \"Awards and recognition\" with the bullets. Let me check again:\n\nThe passage has:\n\n## Awards and recognition\n\n* Mexico\u2019s Best Business Executive in Marketing in 1998 by the Mexican Businessmen Chamber Association. [S26] * The Caribbean Business (Puerto Rico) recognized Amaury Rivera as one of the Top Ten Business Leaders of Puerto Rico in 1997 as selected by its readers. [S27] * \u201cRevista Caras\u201d Caras Magazine selected Rivera as the most successful young executives under 40 in 1998. [S28] * In 1995, The Young Businessman Committee of the Interamerican Business Association bestowed Rivera \u201cThe Young Businessman of the Year\u201d Award. [S29] * The Puerto Rico Legislature unanimously issued a congratulatory proclamation in favor of Rivera for his achievements as president of the Puerto Rico Products Association\n\nWait, the last bullet here is part of the \"Awards and recognition\" section. So that's included. But the citation for that last point is [S30]? Let me check the original passage's citations. The original passage's sentences are numbered up to S30? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the original passage, the sentences are:\n\n[S1] Amaury Rivera\n\n[S2] He set up the two earliest competitors...\n\n[S3] territory's telecommunication's market...\n\n[S4] citation needed\n\n[S5] Rivera holds a Bachelor...\n\n[S6] Rivera studied finance...\n\n[S7] From 2003 to 2008...\n\n[S8] From 2000 to 2003...\n\n[S9] In addition, he was chief...\n\n[S10] Rivera was responsible...\n\n[S11] He served as senior...\n\n[S12] Rivera was recognized...\n\n[S13] From 1996 to 1998...\n\n[S14] His efforts...\n\n[S15] Rivera served as vice...\n\n[S16] During 1989\u20131993...\n\n[S17] From 1984 to 1989...\n\n[S18] in New York.\n\n[S19] Rivera is an independent...\n\n[S20] Rivera was Secretary...\n\n[S21] Rivera was chairman...\n\n[S22] Rivera served as member...\n\n[S23] Rivera was a delegate...\n\n[S24] Rivera was a member...\n\n[S25] He was appointed...\n\n[S26] Mexico\u2019s Best Business...\n\n[S27] The Caribbean Business...\n\n[S28] \u201cRevista Caras\u201d Caras...\n\n[S29] In 1995, The Young...\n\n[S30] The Puerto Rico Legislature...\n\nSo yes, the last bullet in the awards section is [S30]. Therefore, that's included.\n\nSo the answer should include all these awards and recognitions. Now, I need to structure each sentence with the citations. Each award is a separate sentence. So:\n\n1. \"Mexico\u2019s Best Business Executive in Marketing in 1998 by the Mexican Businessmen Chamber Association.\" [S26]\n2. \"The Caribbean Business (Puerto Rico) recognized Amaury Rivera as one of the Top Ten Business Leaders of Puerto Rico in 1997 as selected by its readers.\" [S27]\n3. \"Revista Caras\" Caras Magazine selected Rivera as the most successful young executives under 40 in 1998.\" [S28]\n4. \"In 1995, The Young Businessman Committee of the Interamerican Business Association bestowed Rivera 'The Young Businessman of the Year' Award.\" [S29]\n5. \"The Puerto Rico Legislature unanimously issued a congratulatory proclamation in favor of Rivera for his achievements as president of the Puerto Rico Products Association.\" [S30]\n\nBut I need to check if each of these is a separate sentence. The original passage lists them as bullet points, but in the context, each bullet is a separate sentence. So each of these would be a separate <statement> with their respective citations.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list each of these awards with their citations."
