      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] ASOS (retailer)\n\n\n# ASOS (retailer)\n\n\n\n**ASOS plc** (/\u02c8e\u026as\u0252s/ AY-soss) is a British online fast-fashion and cosmetic retailer. [S2] The company was founded in 2000 in London, primarily aimed at young adults. [S3] The website sells over 850 brands as well as its own range of clothing and accessories, and ships to all 196 countries from fulfilment centres in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. [S4] ASOS originally stood for *AsSeenOnScreen* with the tagline \"Buy what you see on film and TV\" because it exclusively sold imitations of clothing from those mediums (for example, Brad Pitt's red leather jacket from the 1999 film *Fight Club*). [S5] ASOS's headquarters are in Camden Town, at Greater London House, with additional offices in Berlin and Birmingham. [S6] As of 2013\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49, their main fulfilment centre is in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, where they employ 3,500 workers. [S7] The customer care department is based in Leavesden. [S8] The Danish company Bestseller A/S, owned by the business magnate Anders Holch Povlsen, is ASOS's largest stakeholder, with a 26% share. [S9] The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. [S10] ## History\n\n\n### 2000\u20132004\n\nASOS was established on 3 June 2000, by Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan, Quentin Griffiths, and Deborah Thorpe. [S11] In 2001, ASOS was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on the London Stock Exchange. [S12] In 2003, ASOS shareholders agreed to change the names of AsSeenOnScreen Holdings PLC and AsSeenOnScreen Limited to ASOS plc and ASOS.com Limited. [S13] In 2004, the company reported a maiden profit, with sales almost doubling in its first half. [S14] In 2004, ASOS introduced their own label for women's clothing. [S15] ### 2005\u20132012\n\nIn 2005, the Buncefield Fuel Depot explosion led to the closure of the business for six weeks and \u00a35m of stock was lost. [S16] In 2008, ASOS debuted kidswear on its site, however the branded market subsequently suffered declines at the expense of fast-growing own-label kidswear offers. [S17] In 2010, ASOS announced it would no longer offer kidswear, to concentrate on its core young adult fashion market. [S18] In the final quarter of 2010, ASOS launched three international online shops in Germany, France and the US. [S19] In November 2010, ASOS launched its marketplace platform for boutiques, vintage collectors, individuals and designers to trade from virtual market stalls to customers globally. [S20] In September 2011, ASOS launched three more sites in Australia, Italy and Spain. [S21] In 2012, ASOS opened its first international office in Sydney, Australia, followed by an office in New York. [S22] Later on, the company launched its first drama-game show series, called *#DIGIDATING*, starring AJ Odudu. [S23] It was billed as an Internet dating show with backstage drama. [S24] ### 2013\u20132019\n\nIn 2013, ASOS opened its first office outside the South East, in Birmingham. [S25] Later in 2013, ASOS recalled belts contaminated with radioactive cobalt-60. [S26] ASOS in Russia and China were launched in the same year. [S27] In 2014, a fire in the Barnsley warehouse prevented them from taking orders for almost three days. [S28] During the 2014 Formula One season, ASOS was a sponsor of the McLaren Formula One team. [S29] In 2015, ASOS had over 4,000 employees and was the UK's largest independent online and fashion beauty retailer. [S30] In September 2016, an investigative report from BuzzFeed News alleged poor working conditions at ASOS's warehouse. [S31] However, company spokespersons contended that the isolated complaints reported in the BuzzFeed article were not reflective of the general working conditions there. [S32] In April 2019, ASOS informed its clients through email that the company is looking into ways of changing its easy returns policy, after research showed customers were manipulating the easy return process. [S33] The company also admitted that the previous return policy was environmentally costly. [S34] ### 2020\u2013present\n\nPassage 2:\n[S35] In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ASOS was accused by some staff and workers unions of *\"playing Russian roulette with people\u2019s lives\"* by failing to adequately enforce preventative measures in their Grimethorpe, Barnsley site. [S36] It was claimed that warehouse staff could not safely operate whilst maintaining social distancing, that the staff felt unsafe and that ASOS's product was not actually essential, thus not meeting the UK Government's recommendation that only essential workplaces remain open. [S37] The company disputed these claims, claiming they had sufficiently changed their operation to comply, Barnsley Council also inspected the site and found that the company was complying. [S38] In October 2020, ASOS Marketplace announced that it would not be charging commission rates on small business transactions to provide support through the COVID-19 pandemic for sellers. [S39] In April 2021, ASOS has partnered with delivery company DPD of DPDgroup to allow shoppers the option to donate unwanted clothing to charity. [S40] In June 2021, ASOS launched a partnership with Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics. [S41] In February 2021, it was announced that ASOS was to acquire the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, and HIIT brands from collapsed Philip Green's Arcadia Group. [S42] On 4 February, the three former Arcadia Group brands became wholly owned subsidiaries of ASOS, with 300 head-office staff members from Arcadia and Topshop/Topman Limited. [S43] In November 2021, Ian Dyson, former Marks & Spencer finance director, became Chair. [S44] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ASOS suspended operations in Russia. [S45] In January 2023 ASOS's share value UK dropped by 70% compared to the previous year, mainly due to online shopping and shipping of the products. [S46] Consumers were less likely to purchase items online due to delivery problems since Christmas. [S47] In June 2023, it was reported that the Frasers Group had accumulated a stake of nearly 9% in ASOS. [S48] In November 2023, The *Guardian* reported that Asos's business was \"unsustainable\" describing it as a \"fast-fashion also-ran.\" In September 2024, Asos introduced a return fee of \u00a33.95 starting in October which risked alienating customers. [S49] The *BBC* reported that customers had reacted to the decision with anger with returns to Asos common due to the company's inconsistent sizing. [S50] ## Digital marketing\n\nIn November 2009, ASOS claimed a ratio of one Twitter follower to eight Facebook fans to 100 active e-mail subscribers. [S51] Their 2008 report pointed out that nearly 10% of sales could be directly attributed to email marketing. [S52] In 2017, ASOS launched a campaign intended to take full advantage of the Instagram Stories feature, encouraging users to upload videos of purchased ASOS products. [S53] 3 million people interacted with the video in the UK. [S54] ASOS uses the #AsSeenOnMe hashtag and any use of the hashtag adds the photos to an ASOS online database.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that caused ASOS's share value to drop by 70% in 2023 and how customer behavior during the holiday season played a role. The supporting context is provided in two passages with various citations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the passages for any mentions of the 70% drop. Scanning through, I see in Passage 2, sentence S46: \"In January 2023 ASOS's share value UK dropped by 70% compared to the previous year, mainly due to online shopping and shipping of the products.\" That's a direct mention. Then, S47 says, \"Consumers were less likely to purchase items online due to delivery problems since Christmas.\" So the main factors here are online shopping and shipping issues, and delivery problems during the holiday season.\n\nBut wait, the question also asks how customer behavior during the holiday season played a role. The delivery problems mentioned in S47 likely relate to the holiday season, as Christmas is a major holiday. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention customer behavior beyond the delivery issues. Maybe the drop in online purchases because of delivery problems is the customer behavior aspect. \n\nAre there other factors? The user might be expecting more, but according to the given context, the main reasons cited are online shopping and shipping issues, and delivery problems. The rest of the passage talks about other events like the acquisition of Topshop, partnerships, etc., but those are before 2023. The return fee in S49 and customer anger in S50 are in 2023 but after January, so maybe not directly related to the January drop. \n\nSo the answer should cite S46 and S47. The statement about the share drop is in S46, and the customer behavior (less online purchases due to delivery issues) is in S47. The user might also wonder if there's more, but based on the provided context, those are the key points. Need to make sure not to add external knowledge and stick strictly to the citations given."

        "[S35] In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, ASOS was accused by some staff and workers unions of *\"playing Russian roulette with people\u2019s lives\"* by failing to adequately enforce preventative measures in their Grimethorpe, Barnsley site. [S36] It was claimed that warehouse staff could not safely operate whilst maintaining social distancing, that the staff felt unsafe and that ASOS's product was not actually essential, thus not meeting the UK Government's recommendation that only essential workplaces remain open. [S37] The company disputed these claims, claiming they had sufficiently changed their operation to comply, Barnsley Council also inspected the site and found that the company was complying. [S38] In October 2020, ASOS Marketplace announced that it would not be charging commission rates on small business transactions to provide support through the COVID-19 pandemic for sellers. [S39] In April 2021, ASOS has partnered with delivery company DPD of DPDgroup to allow shoppers the option to donate unwanted clothing to charity. [S40] In June 2021, ASOS launched a partnership with Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics. [S41] In February 2021, it was announced that ASOS was to acquire the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, and HIIT brands from collapsed Philip Green's Arcadia Group. [S42] On 4 February, the three former Arcadia Group brands became wholly owned subsidiaries of ASOS, with 300 head-office staff members from Arcadia and Topshop/Topman Limited. [S43] In November 2021, Ian Dyson, former Marks & Spencer finance director, became Chair. [S44] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ASOS suspended operations in Russia. [S45] In January 2023 ASOS's share value UK dropped by 70% compared to the previous year, mainly due to online shopping and shipping of the products. [S46] Consumers were less likely to purchase items online due to delivery problems since Christmas. [S47] In June 2023, it was reported that the Frasers Group had accumulated a stake of nearly 9% in ASOS. [S48] In November 2023, The *Guardian* reported that Asos's business was \"unsustainable\" describing it as a \"fast-fashion also-ran.\" In September 2024, Asos introduced a return fee of \u00a33.95 starting in October which risked alienating customers. [S49] The *BBC* reported that customers had reacted to the decision with anger with returns to Asos common due to the company's inconsistent sizing. [S50] ## Digital marketing\n\nIn November 2009, ASOS claimed a ratio of one Twitter follower to eight Facebook fans to 100 active e-mail subscribers. [S51] Their 2008 report pointed out that nearly 10% of sales could be directly attributed to email marketing. [S52] In 2017, ASOS launched a campaign intended to take full advantage of the Instagram Stories feature, encouraging users to upload videos of purchased ASOS products.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how ASOS responded to the 2020 pandemic-related accusations about workplace safety and the outcome of the council's inspection.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections, and the relevant info is probably in Passage 2 since it covers the 2020 period. Let me scan through the sentences in Passage 2.\n\nLooking at sentence S35: It mentions that in April 2020, ASOS was accused by staff and unions of not enforcing preventative measures at their Grimethorpe, Barnsley site. The accusations included unsafe working conditions and not meeting the UK government's essential workplace guidelines. \n\nThen, S36 and S37 elaborate on the claims. But the key part is S38, which says that the company disputed these claims, stating they had changed operations to comply. Also, Barnsley Council inspected the site and found compliance. \n\nSo, the response from ASOS was disputing the claims and asserting compliance. The outcome of the inspection was that the council found them compliant. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that add more info. The rest of the passage talks about other events in 2020 and later, like the marketplace commission change and partnerships, but those aren't relevant here. \n\nSo the answer should state that ASOS disputed the accusations, claiming they had made necessary changes, and the council's inspection confirmed compliance. The citations would be S35, S36, S37, and S38. Wait, but the user wants each sentence in the answer to have its own citations. So I need to structure the answer into statements, each with their citations.\n\nFirst statement: ASOS was accused in April 2020. Citations S35, S36, S37. Then the second statement about their response and the council's inspection, citing S38. \n\nWait, but the question is about both the response and the outcome. So maybe two sentences. Let me check the exact wording. The user wants the answer to include both how ASOS responded and the outcome of the inspection. So the first sentence could be the accusations and their response, and the second the outcome. But need to make sure each sentence is properly cited. \n\nAlternatively, split into two statements. Let me structure it as:\n\n1. ASOS faced accusations in 2020 about workplace safety. [S35][S36][S37]\n2. The company disputed the claims, stating they had complied, and the council found them compliant. [S38]\n\nYes, that should cover it. Need to make sure the citations are correctly placed. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. I don't think so. The rest of the passage doesn't mention the council's inspection outcome beyond S38. So that's the correct info."

This suggests that the acquisition led to hiring or integrating existing staff from the acquired companies. However, there's no mention of layoffs or other workforce changes.

[S3] The website sells over 850 brands as well as its own range of clothing and accessories, and ships to all 196 countries from fulfilment centres in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. [S4] ASOS originally stood for *AsSeenOnScreen* with the tagline \"Buy what you see on film and TV\" because it exclusively sold imitations of clothing from those mediums (for example, Brad Pitt's red leather jacket from the 1999 film *Fight Club*). [S5] ASOS's headquarters are in Camden Town, at Greater London House, with additional offices in Berlin and Birmingham.

[S10] ## History\n\n\n### 2000\u20132004\n\nASOS was established on 3 June 2000, by Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan, Quentin Griffiths, and Deborah Thorpe. [S11] In 2001, ASOS was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on the London Stock Exchange. [S12] In 2003, ASOS shareholders agreed to change the names of AsSeenOnScreen Holdings PLC and AsSeenOnScreen Limited to ASOS plc and ASOS.com Limited. [S13] In 2004, the company reported a maiden profit, with sales almost doubling in its first half. [S14] In 2004, ASOS introduced their own label for women's clothing. [S15] ### 2005\u20132012\n\nIn 2005, the Buncefield Fuel Depot explosion led to the closure of the business for six weeks and \u00a35m of stock was lost. [S16] In 2008, ASOS debuted kidswear on its site, however the branded market subsequently suffered declines at the expense of fast-growing own-label kidswear offers. [S17] In 2010, ASOS announced it would no longer offer kidswear, to concentrate on its core young adult fashion market. [S18] In the final quarter of 2010, ASOS launched three international online shops in Germany, France and the US. [S19] In November 2010, ASOS launched its marketplace platform for boutiques, vintage collectors, individuals and designers to trade from virtual market stalls to customers globally. [S20] In September 2011, ASOS launched three more sites in Australia, Italy and Spain. [S21] In 2012, ASOS opened its first international office in Sydney, Australia, followed by an office in New York.

[S28] During the 2014 Formula One season, ASOS was a sponsor of the McLaren Formula One team. [S29] In 2015, ASOS had over 4,000 employees and was the UK's largest independent online and fashion beauty retailer. [S30] In September 2016, an investigative report from BuzzFeed News alleged poor working conditions at ASOS's warehouse. [S31] However, company spokespersons contended that the isolated complaints reported in the BuzzFeed article were not reflective of the general working conditions there. [S32] In April 2019, ASOS informed its clients through email that the company is looking into ways of changing its easy returns policy, after research showed customers were manipulating the easy return process.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the changes ASOS made to their return policy in 2019 and the reasons behind those changes. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage for any mentions of 2019. In Passage 1, under the section \"2013\u20132019\", there's a sentence that says: \"In April 2019, ASOS informed its clients through email that the company is looking into ways of changing its easy returns policy, after research showed customers were manipulating the easy return process. [S33] The company also admitted that the previous return policy was environmentally costly. [S34]\"\n\nSo, the key points here are that ASOS was considering changes to their easy returns policy because customers were manipulating the process and because the previous policy was environmentally costly. The citations here are S33 and S34. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in the passage about 2019 return policy changes. Let me check the rest of the text. The other parts talk about different years, like 2020 and beyond, but nothing else about 2019. \n\nTherefore, the answer should mention the changes as looking into modifying the easy returns policy due to customer manipulation and environmental costs. The citations would be [S33] and [S34]. I need to structure the answer with each sentence citing the relevant sources."
