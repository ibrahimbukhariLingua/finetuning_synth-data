      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S58] At the middle of the city block is the galleria from 51st to 52nd Street. [S59] It is one of six passageways that form 6\u00bd Avenue, a set of full-block passageways from 51st to 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. [S60] The passageway was built as a \"through-block connection\" under the Special Midtown District, created in 1982. [S61] The space measures 45 feet (14\u00a0m) wide and 91 feet (28\u00a0m) tall underneath the north and south ends, where the seventh and eighth floors cross the galleria. [S62] The center of the space, beneath the skylights, is 124 feet (38\u00a0m) tall. [S63] Burton designed outdoor seating for the galleria. [S64] On the galleria's eastern wall is a passageway to 1285 Sixth Avenue's lobby, which originally connected with the Paine Webber Art Gallery in that building. [S65] The lobbies of 1285 Sixth Avenue and Equitable Center measured a combined 800 feet (240\u00a0m) long. [S66] An elevator lobby for the First National Bank of Chicago, just east of the galleria, contained Agnes Denes's artwork *Hypersphere: The Earth in the Shape of the Universe*, a set of 144 glass panels. [S67] LeWitt commissioned a set of six geometric artworks for the walls of the galleria entitled *Wall Drawing: Bands of Lines in Four Colors and Four Directions, Separated by Gray Bands*. [S68] As the name indicates, LeWitt's artwork consists of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal bands in four colors, created in acrylic paint on limestone. [S69] These works, which are up to 106 feet (32\u00a0m) high, are illuminated by natural light coming through the rooftop skylights. [S70] In addition, Flanagan designed two bronze sculptures at the galleria's north and south ends, each depicting animals in whimsical scenes. [S71] The north end contains *Young Elephant* (1986), while the south end contains *Hare on Bell* (1985). [S72] Two escalators lead from the galleria to Axa Center's public basement concourse. [S73] The escalators are placed within a glass enclosure containing a gold-colored frame. [S74] The basement concourse is connected to Rockefeller Center's underground concourse, which in turn provides a connection to the New York City Subway's 47th\u201350th Streets\u2013Rockefeller Center station. [S75] Axa Center's basement concourse also contains the Athletic & Swim Club, which has a fitness center and a small swimming pool. [S76] Valerie Jaudon had created a mural for the swimming pool's wall, measuring 72 by 12 feet (21.9 by 3.7\u00a0m).

[S78] According to the New York City Department of City Planning, the building has a gross floor area of 1,633,544 square feet (151,761.2\u00a0m\u00b2). [S79] Equitable was allowed to include an additional 49,161 square feet (4,567.2\u00a0m\u00b2) in exchange for providing privately owned public space. [S80] The steel superstructure contains two-story outrigger trusses wrapping around the 11th and 36th stories, which transfer the structural loads and absorb the wind loads at each of the setbacks. [S81] Belt trusses connect the outrigger trusses to the building's structural core. [S82] The roof is surrounded by a hat truss, behind which is mechanical equipment. [S83] From the beginning, 787 Seventh Avenue contained several \"smart\" building systems, such as high-capacity fiber optic cables and conduits, as well as a computerized display to monitor energy use, security, and elevators. [S84] The \"smart\" systems cost $2 to $4 million, though that cost also included a retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S85] The building is internally connected to 1285 Sixth Avenue at the ground floor, concourse, and first eight stories. [S86] The 787 Seventh Avenue building was known as Equitable Center West or Equitable Tower, while the 1285 Sixth Avenue building was known as Equitable Center East.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the construction of Equitable Center influenced the development of Midtown Manhattan and the contrasting perspectives on its impact.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts. Let me scan through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a lot about the galleria, passageways, and other buildings like 1285 Sixth Avenue and Axa Center. But I need to focus on Equitable Center. Wait, in Passage 2, there are specific mentions. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, [S224] says Equitable was the first major company to build a headquarters on Seventh Avenue in Midtown. [S225] mentions it was the only major office structure there at completion. Then [S227] quotes Reynolds saying the building encouraged office development to move west from Sixth to Seventh Avenue, similar to Rockefeller Center's effect. That's a key point about influencing development. \n\nAlso, [S228] mentions controversy over over-concentration of skyscrapers in midtown. So there's a contrasting perspective here\u2014developers might have seen it as positive, while civic groups were worried. \n\n[S229] states the development improved the surrounding area's character in the mid-80s. But [S230] notes that civic organizations worried theaters north of Times Square would be replaced by offices. So the contrasting views are between development boost vs. concerns about replacing theaters.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points. The influence is the westward shift of office development, inspired by Rockefeller Center's example. The contrasting perspectives are the positive impact on the area's character and the controversy over skyscraper concentration, plus the fear of replacing theaters.\n\nNow, check the citations. The sentences about the influence are [S224][S225][S227][S229]. The contrasting views are [S228] and [S230]. \n\nMake sure each statement in the answer cites the correct sentences. Also, ensure that each sentence is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Avoid any markdown and follow the format exactly."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S123] A broadcast studio and auditorium were also designed for the building. [S124] The Equitable auditorium has 487, 495, or 500 seats, accessed from a staircase from the atrium. [S125] The auditorium has been used for several major corporate events, including the announcement of a merger between IBM and Lotus Software, as well as the merger announcement of Kimberly-Clark and Scott Paper Company. [S126] It has also been used for musical performances, such as a jazz performance by Roy Nathanson in 1990. [S127] Equitable officials had their own private bathrooms as well as Chippendale furniture. [S128] The 49th and 50th floors comprised Equitable's executive suite and were connected by a stair. [S129] The 49th floor was designed with 14 dining rooms, each with works from a different artists. [S130] The dining rooms range from a small accommodation, with one table and four chairs, to a dining hall with a baby grand piano, sofas, and a fireplace. [S131] There were two executive rooms at the 50th story: one facing east and the other facing west. [S132] The rooms had classical-inspired moldings, large woodwork, and custom furnishings designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Conway. [S133] The western room, which served as Equitable's main boardroom, was originally designed with a green carpet with a large circular table. [S134] The eastern room had Equitable's main dining room and contained *Triptych*, a trio of landscapes by Brad Davis. [S135] ## History\n\nEquitable Holdings (originally the Equitable Life Assurance Society) had constructed several structures in New York City since the late 19th century, as well as several across the United States. [S136] The first New York City office was the Equitable Life Building on 120 Broadway in Lower Manhattan, completed in 1870. [S137] The Equitable Life Building was destroyed by a fire in 1912 and replaced by the current Equitable Building at 120 Broadway. [S138] Equitable Life moved to 393 Seventh Avenue (now 11 Penn Plaza) in 1924, and it moved to 1281 Sixth Avenue in 1961. [S139] Equitable had occupied all 1.8\u00a0million square feet (170,000\u00a0m\u00b2) in its Sixth Avenue building for over twenty years. [S140] However, by the 1980s, it was looking to move decentralize its New York City office. [S141] The company split into four major divisions, of which only one, Equitable Capital, remained in the Sixth Avenue building. [S142] At the time, office space in Midtown Manhattan was in high demand and Equitable felt it could lease its Sixth Avenue building at a great profit. [S143] ### Development\n\nAfter considering relocating elsewhere in the United States, Equitable planned to expand its Sixth Avenue headquarters by 1980. [S144] Over the next year, it acquired an adjacent L-shaped site extending to Seventh Avenue, measuring 67,000 square feet (6,200\u00a0m\u00b2). [S145] Except for a small plot on the corner of Seventh Avenue and 52nd Street, Equitable had control of the entire city block. [S146] Equitable first announced its intention, in March 1981, to construct a tower on the newly acquired Seventh Avenue site. [S147] Demolition of existing buildings, such as the Victoria and Abbey hotels, began soon after. [S148] General contractor Turner Construction performed the demolitions manually, even though it had the city government's permission to use dynamite, since it wished to minimize disruption to neighboring structures. [S149] During one demolition in 1982, a steel beam fell through the roof of a nearby deli.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S202] Bar Americain, at the building's ground floor, closed in 2018. [S203] A helicopter crashed on Axa Equitable Center's roof on June 10, 2019, killing the pilot and sparking a fire that prompted the building's evacuation. [S204] No one else was hurt in the crash, and the helicopter's wreckage was removed. [S205] The Urbanspace food hall opened at the ground level of Axa Equitable Center in early 2020. [S206] In 2022, following the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, BNP Paribas renovated its offices at 787 Seventh Avenue to encourage workers to return to the firm's physical offices. [S207] In addition, a sign with the name \"BNP Paribas\" was installed above the Seventh Avenue entrance, replacing Equitable's name. [S208] Although 787 Seventh Avenue had an occupancy rate of 96 percent by early 2024, its value had declined by $123 million since the pandemic; at the time, the building was estimated to be worth $917 million. [S209] The reduced valuation reflected the fact that BNP Paribas had downsized its space at the building from 450,000 to 300,000 square feet (42,000 to 28,000\u00a0m\u00b2), while the lease of another major tenant, UBS, was scheduled to expire in 2026. [S210] ## Tenants\n\nAs of 2024\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49, several financial and law firms occupy the space, including:\n\n* BNP Paribas, banking group\n* Citigroup, investment bank\n* Sidley Austin, law firm\n* Stifel, investment bank\n* UBS, investment bank\n* Willkie Farr & Gallagher, law firm\n\n## Impact\n\n\n### Reception\n\nThe design of Equitable Tower was largely criticized upon its completion. [S211] Paul Goldberger called the building \"54 stories of ambivalence\", saying it \"adds almost no grace to the skyline\". [S212] *Progressive Architecture* was similarly critical of the \"undistinguished quality\" of the facade, saying: \"Barnes's tower can't seem to make up its mind whether it's a Modern skyscraper or a Post-Modern one\", Roger Kimball of *The New Criterion* wrote: \"Mr. [S213] Barnes seems to have abandoned any attempt at a cogent architectural design. [S214] Instead, he has contrived to produce one of the most pretentious and ungainly new buildings in New York.\" *The New Criterion* cited Equitable Tower's \"large clunky base\", its \"replaceable\"-looking granite and limestone facade, and its massive arches that \"seem more like movie-set novelties\" as flaws in the design. [S215] Suzanne Stephens said the criticism showed that Barnes was \"more adept at chipping, chamfering and chiseling buildings with rotated geometries\". [S216] By contrast, architectural writer Donald M. [S217] Reynolds said the building was \"one of the largest and most comprehensive collaborations of architecture, urban planning, and public art since Rockefeller Center\". [S218] The artwork was received more positively by architectural and art critics. [S219] *The New York Times* reported that the artwork was a \"statement of [Equitable's] belief not only in the commercial and promotional value of art, but also in the role art can play in the quality of corporate and communal life\". [S220] *Progressive Architecture* characterized the collection as \"one of the more successful corporate art programs to come along in some time\", as opposed to the \"resolutely ho-hum\" character of much of Equitable Tower. [S221] Phaidon Press wrote of the art collection: \"AXA Equitable Life Insurance wished to project a positive image of itself to New Yorkers\u2014as progressive, leading edge and civic-minded, as demonstrated by this indisputable gift to the city.\" Conversely, *The New Criterion* wrote that the collection was \"not art but money\", in that it was a showcase of Equitable's wealth rather than a display of art for its own sake. [S222] Goldberger thought that, even with the art and public spaces, the building \"lacks a kind of freshness, as if everyone involved in this project were doing it by rote\".

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the architectural features of the Axa Equitable Center that were designed to accommodate both corporate events and executive functions, and how these elements reflected the company's priorities during its development.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage has two parts, but the first one seems more relevant here. Let me scan through the sentences in Passage 1.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S123] mentions a broadcast studio and auditorium. Then [S124] talks about the Equitable auditorium's seating and access from the atrium. [S125] states that the auditorium was used for major corporate events like merger announcements. [S127] mentions private bathrooms and Chippendale furniture for officials. [S128] refers to the 49th and 50th floors as the executive suite connected by a stair. [S129] describes the 49th floor with 14 dining rooms by different artists. [S130] explains the range of dining rooms, from small to large with amenities. [S131] mentions two executive rooms on the 50th floor, east and west. [S132] talks about classical-inspired moldings and custom furnishings. [S133] details the western room as the main boardroom with a green carpet and circular table. [S134] mentions the eastern room's dining area with a Triptych artwork. \n\nThese sentences seem to outline the features. The auditorium (S123, S124, S125) was for corporate events. The executive suite on 49th and 50th floors (S128) with dining rooms (S129, S130) and private rooms (S131, S132, S133, S134) were for executive functions. The Chippendale furniture and private bathrooms (S127) indicate luxury and privacy. The art in the dining rooms (S134) might reflect the company's emphasis on art and corporate image.\n\nNow, how did these reflect the company's priorities? The mention of corporate events (merger announcements) suggests they wanted a space for significant business activities. The executive suite's design with multiple dining rooms and custom furnishings shows a focus on luxury and providing high-end facilities for executives. The art collection (though not directly in the first passage, maybe in the second?) Wait, the second passage mentions art in the context of the building's design, but the user's question is about the Axa Equitable Center. However, the supporting context here might not have that info. Wait, the first passage's S135 is about the Triptych artwork in the eastern room. Also, the later part of Passage 1 mentions the history and development, but the user's question is about the architectural features during development. \n\nThe company's priorities during development would be reflected in the features designed. The auditorium for events shows they wanted a venue for important corporate activities. The executive suite with private areas and art suggests they valued both functionality and prestige. The custom furnishings and art indicate a focus on creating a high-quality, prestigious environment, possibly to project a positive image. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The auditorium features are in S123, S124, S125. The executive suite is S128, S129, S130, S131, S132, S133, S134. The private bathrooms and Chippendale furniture are in S127. The art in the dining rooms is in S134. \n\nSo the answer should list these features with their citations. The reflection on priorities would tie the auditorium to hosting major events, the executive suite to luxury and privacy, and the art to corporate image."

[S143] ### Development\n\nAfter considering relocating elsewhere in the United States, Equitable planned to expand its Sixth Avenue headquarters by 1980. [S144] Over the next year, it acquired an adjacent L-shaped site extending to Seventh Avenue, measuring 67,000 square feet (6,200\u00a0m\u00b2).

[S146] Equitable first announced its intention, in March 1981, to construct a tower on the newly acquired Seventh Avenue site. [S147] Demolition of existing buildings, such as the Victoria and Abbey hotels, began soon after. [S148] General contractor Turner Construction performed the demolitions manually, even though it had the city government's permission to use dynamite, since it wished to minimize disruption to neighboring structures.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the mixed critical reception of the Axa Equitable Center's design contrasted with the reception of its art collection, and what that suggests about the building's overall impact.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections, and the relevant part is under \"Impact\" and specifically \"Reception\". Let me scan through that.\n\nIn the \"Reception\" section, it says the design was largely criticized. There are quotes from Paul Goldberger calling it \"54 stories of ambivalence\" and other critics like *Progressive Architecture* and Roger Kimball from *The New Criterion* who criticized the facade and design. However, there's also a positive note from Donald M. Reynolds who praised it as a comprehensive collaboration. So the design had mixed reviews.\n\nThen, the art collection is mentioned as being received more positively. *The New York Times* and *Progressive Architecture* praised the art collection, seeing it as a positive corporate image and a successful program. However, *The New Criterion* criticized it as just showcasing wealth. But overall, the art seems to have a more positive reception compared to the design.\n\nThe question is asking how these two receptions contrast. So the design was mixed, with some critics being harsh, while the art collection was more positively received, though not universally. The contrast is between the building's design being criticized and the art collection being praised. \n\nWhat does this suggest about the building's overall impact? Well, even though the design had issues, the art collection added value. The mixed reception of the design might mean that while the building wasn't aesthetically successful, the art elements contributed positively. However, the overall impact might be mixed too, as the building's design flaws were significant, but the art collection was a positive aspect. The mention of the art being a \"statement\" of the company's values and the contrast with the building's \"resolutely ho-hum\" character suggests that the art tried to elevate the building's image but the design itself wasn't as effective.\n\nNow, I need to find the specific sentences in the context that support this. Let me check the citations.\n\nFor the design criticism: [S211] to [S223]. Specifically, [S211] says the design was largely criticized. Then [S212] has Goldberger's quote. [S213]-[S215] have the *New Criterion* comments. [S216] mentions Suzanne Stephens' comment. [S217]-[S218] is Reynolds' positive take. \n\nFor the art collection: [S219] says the artwork was received more positively. [S220] has *The New York Times* quote. [S221] is *Progressive Architecture* praising the collection. [S222] mentions *The New Criterion*'s negative take on the art as \"not art but money\". [S223] has Goldberger's comment about the building lacking freshness despite the art.\n\nSo the contrast is between the design's mixed to negative reviews and the art's more positive but still some criticism. The overall impact might be that the building's design was problematic, but the art collection tried to compensate, leading to a mixed overall impact.\n\nNow, structuring the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should be in <statement> with citations. Need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence, and citations are correctly placed.\n\nFirst statement: The design of the Axa Equitable Center received mixed critical reception, with some critics calling it \"54 stories of ambivalence\" and criticizing its \"undistinguished quality\" and \"pretentious and ungainly\" appearance. Citations would be [S211][S212][S213][S215][S216].\n\nSecond statement: However, architectural writer Donald M. Reynolds praised the building as \"one of the largest and most comprehensive collaborations of architecture, urban planning, and public art since Rockefeller Center.\" [S217][S218].\n\nThird statement: In contrast, the art collection was received more positively by critics, with *The New York Times* highlighting its role in enhancing corporate and communal life, and *Progressive Architecture* calling it \"one of the more successful corporate art programs.\" [S219][S220][S221].\n\nFourth statement: Nonetheless, *The New Criterion* criticized the art collection as \"not art but money,\" suggesting it was a display of wealth rather than artistic value. [S222].\n\nFifth statement: This contrast between the building's design criticism and the art collection's mixed reception suggests that while the art aimed to elevate the building's image, the design's flaws may have limited its overall impact. [S223].\n\nWait, but the question is about how the mixed reception of the design contrasted with the art collection's reception. So the design had mixed (some negative, some positive), while the art had more positive but some negative. The overall impact is that the building's design was problematic, but the art tried to compensate. \n\nNeed to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. Also, check if all citations are correctly referenced. For example, the part about the art collection being more positively received is [S219], and the specific quotes are [S220][S221][S222]. The last statement about overall impact would cite [S223] where Goldberger mentions the building lacking freshness despite the art.\n\nI think that's it. Now format each statement with the citations."

[S211] Paul Goldberger called the building \"54 stories of ambivalence\", saying it \"adds almost no grace to the skyline\". [S212] *Progressive Architecture* was similarly critical of the \"undistinguished quality\" of the facade, saying: \"Barnes's tower can't seem to make up its mind whether it's a Modern skyscraper or a Post-Modern one\", Roger Kimball of *The New Criterion* wrote: \"Mr. [S213] Barnes seems to have abandoned any attempt at a cogent architectural design. [S214] Instead, he has contrived to produce one of the most pretentious and ungainly new buildings in New York.\" *The New Criterion* cited Equitable Tower's \"large clunky base\", its \"replaceable\"-looking granite and limestone facade, and its massive arches that \"seem more like movie-set novelties\" as flaws in the design. [S215] Suzanne Stephens said the criticism showed that Barnes was \"more adept at chipping, chamfering and chiseling buildings with rotated geometries\". [S216] By contrast, architectural writer Donald M. [S217] Reynolds said the building was \"one of the largest and most comprehensive collaborations of architecture, urban planning, and public art since Rockefeller Center\". [S218] The artwork was received more positively by architectural and art critics. [S219] *The New York Times* reported that the artwork was a \"statement of [Equitable's] belief not only in the commercial and promotional value of art, but also in the role art can play in the quality of corporate and communal life\". [S220] *Progressive Architecture* characterized the collection as \"one of the more successful corporate art programs to come along in some time\", as opposed to the \"resolutely ho-hum\" character of much of Equitable Tower.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about recent changes in tenant composition and building usage that have influenced the Axa Equitable Center's financial valuation and operational dynamics. I need to look through the provided passages and find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan Passage 1 and Passage 2 for mentions of tenants, building usage, and financial aspects. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Tenants\" which lists current occupants as of 2024. But the question is about recent changes. Looking at the \"Impact\" section, there's a mention of BNP Paribas renovating offices in 2022 to encourage return to physical offices after the pandemic. Also, BNP Paribas downsized their space from 450,000 to 300,000 sq ft. Additionally, UBS's lease was set to expire in 2026. These tenant changes could affect the building's valuation. \n\nAnother point is the occupancy rate being 96% in early 2024, but the building's value declined by $123 million since the pandemic. The decline is linked to BNP Paribas downsizing and UBS's lease expiration. That's directly related to tenant composition changes. \n\nAlso, in Passage 2, the Urbanspace food hall opened in 2020, which is a change in building usage. The closure of Bar Americain in 2018 and the helicopter crash in 2019 might be operational incidents, but not sure if they directly affect financial valuation. However, the helicopter crash might have operational impacts, but the context doesn't mention financial effects from that. \n\nThe renovation by BNP Paribas in 2022 is mentioned, which could influence operational dynamics. The sign change from Equitable to BNP Paribas might indicate a shift in tenant prominence. \n\nSo the key points are BNP Paribas downsizing, UBS lease expiration, and the Urbanspace food hall opening. The financial valuation decline is tied to these tenant changes. The citations for these points would be S206 (Urbanspace), S209 (valuation decline), S210 (BNP Paribas downsizing and UBS lease). \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing these sources. Also, check if there are other relevant sentences. The passage mentions that the building's value declined by $123 million, which is in S209. The tenant changes are in S210. The Urbanspace opening is S205. \n\nSo the answer should include the changes in tenants (BNP Paribas downsizing, UBS lease), the new food hall, and the resulting financial impact. Each statement needs to have the correct citations."

[S212] *Progressive Architecture* was similarly critical of the \"undistinguished quality\" of the facade, saying: \"Barnes's tower can't seem to make up its mind whether it's a Modern skyscraper or a Post-Modern one\", Roger Kimball of *The New Criterion* wrote: \"Mr. [S213] Barnes seems to have abandoned any attempt at a cogent architectural design. [S214] Instead, he has contrived to produce one of the most pretentious and ungainly new buildings in New York.\" *The New Criterion* cited Equitable Tower's \"large clunky base\", its \"replaceable\"-looking granite and limestone facade, and its massive arches that \"seem more like movie-set novelties\" as flaws in the design. [S215] Suzanne Stephens said the criticism showed that Barnes was \"more adept at chipping, chamfering and chiseling buildings with rotated geometries\". [S216] By contrast, architectural writer Donald M. [S217] Reynolds said the building was \"one of the largest and most comprehensive collaborations of architecture, urban planning, and public art since Rockefeller Center\". [S218] The artwork was received more positively by architectural and art critics. [S219] *The New York Times* reported that the artwork was a \"statement of [Equitable's] belief not only in the commercial and promotional value of art, but also in the role art can play in the quality of corporate and communal life\". [S220] *Progressive Architecture* characterized the collection as \"one of the more successful corporate art programs to come along in some time\", as opposed to the \"resolutely ho-hum\" character of much of Equitable Tower.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the development process of the Axa Equitable Center, including the demolition of existing structures, reflected the company's strategic goals during the 1980s. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts, but the relevant information is probably in Passage 1, especially the \"History\" and \"Development\" sections. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nIn the \"History\" section, there's mention that by the 1980s, Equitable wanted to decentralize its New York City office. They split into four divisions, with only one remaining in the Sixth Avenue building. Also, office space in Midtown was in high demand, and they thought they could lease the Sixth Avenue building profitably. That seems like a strategic move to optimize their real estate and possibly generate revenue.\n\nThen, under \"Development,\" it says they planned to expand their Sixth Avenue headquarters by 1980, acquired an adjacent site, and started demolishing buildings like the Victoria and Abbey hotels. The demolition was done manually to avoid disrupting neighboring structures. This suggests they were careful about the process, maybe to maintain good relations with the community or avoid legal issues, which could be part of their strategy to ensure smooth development.\n\nThe strategic goals here seem to be about decentralization, maximizing profit through leasing, and expanding their presence in a high-demand area. The demolition was part of acquiring the necessary land for the new tower, which would allow them to modernize their facilities and possibly attract more tenants or improve their corporate image.\n\nI need to check if there are specific citations. The relevant sentences are in the \"History\" and \"Development\" sections. For example, [S140] mentions they occupied the Sixth Avenue building for over twenty years, and by the 1980s, they wanted to decentralize. [S141] and [S142] talk about splitting into divisions and moving some out. [S143] mentions leasing for profit. In the Development section, [S144] about planning to expand, [S145] acquiring the site, [S147] announcing the tower, [S148] demolition of hotels, and [S149] about using manual methods to minimize disruption.\n\nSo the answer should connect the demolition and expansion to their goals of decentralization, leasing for profit, and strategic real estate moves. The citations would be from those sentences."

[S124] The Equitable auditorium has 487, 495, or 500 seats, accessed from a staircase from the atrium. [S125] The auditorium has been used for several major corporate events, including the announcement of a merger between IBM and Lotus Software, as well as the merger announcement of Kimberly-Clark and Scott Paper Company. [S126] It has also been used for musical performances, such as a jazz performance by Roy Nathanson in 1990. [S127] Equitable officials had their own private bathrooms as well as Chippendale furniture. [S128] The 49th and 50th floors comprised Equitable's executive suite and were connected by a stair. [S129] The 49th floor was designed with 14 dining rooms, each with works from a different artists. [S130] The dining rooms range from a small accommodation, with one table and four chairs, to a dining hall with a baby grand piano, sofas, and a fireplace.

[S135] ## History\n\nEquitable Holdings (originally the Equitable Life Assurance Society) had constructed several structures in New York City since the late 19th century, as well as several across the United States. [S136] The first New York City office was the Equitable Life Building on 120 Broadway in Lower Manhattan, completed in 1870. [S137] The Equitable Life Building was destroyed by a fire in 1912 and replaced by the current Equitable Building at 120 Broadway. [S138] Equitable Life moved to 393 Seventh Avenue (now 11 Penn Plaza) in 1924, and it moved to 1281 Sixth Avenue in 1961. [S139] Equitable had occupied all 1.8\u00a0million square feet (170,000\u00a0m\u00b2) in its Sixth Avenue building for over twenty years. [S140] However, by the 1980s, it was looking to move decentralize its New York City office. [S141] The company split into four major divisions, of which only one, Equitable Capital, remained in the Sixth Avenue building. [S142] At the time, office space in Midtown Manhattan was in high demand and Equitable felt it could lease its Sixth Avenue building at a great profit. [S143] ### Development\n\nAfter considering relocating elsewhere in the United States, Equitable planned to expand its Sixth Avenue headquarters by 1980. [S144] Over the next year, it acquired an adjacent L-shaped site extending to Seventh Avenue, measuring 67,000 square feet (6,200\u00a0m\u00b2). [S145] Except for a small plot on the corner of Seventh Avenue and 52nd Street, Equitable had control of the entire city block. [S146] Equitable first announced its intention, in March 1981, to construct a tower on the newly acquired Seventh Avenue site. [S147] Demolition of existing buildings, such as the Victoria and Abbey hotels, began soon after. [S148] General contractor Turner Construction performed the demolitions manually, even though it had the city government's permission to use dynamite, since it wished to minimize disruption to neighboring structures. [S149] During one demolition in 1982, a steel beam fell through the roof of a nearby deli.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S202] Bar Americain, at the building's ground floor, closed in 2018. [S203] A helicopter crashed on Axa Equitable Center's roof on June 10, 2019, killing the pilot and sparking a fire that prompted the building's evacuation. [S204] No one else was hurt in the crash, and the helicopter's wreckage was removed. [S205] The Urbanspace food hall opened at the ground level of Axa Equitable Center in early 2020. [S206] In 2022, following the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, BNP Paribas renovated its offices at 787 Seventh Avenue to encourage workers to return to the firm's physical offices. [S207] In addition, a sign with the name \"BNP Paribas\" was installed above the Seventh Avenue entrance, replacing Equitable's name. [S208] Although 787 Seventh Avenue had an occupancy rate of 96 percent by early 2024, its value had declined by $123 million since the pandemic; at the time, the building was estimated to be worth $917 million. [S209] The reduced valuation reflected the fact that BNP Paribas had downsized its space at the building from 450,000 to 300,000 square feet (42,000 to 28,000\u00a0m\u00b2), while the lease of another major tenant, UBS, was scheduled to expire in 2026.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S177] By 1990, Equitable was in the process of being acquired by the French company Axa. [S178] Within two years, Equitable had gone public and downsized most of its employees, leaving only 2,200 working at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S179] The company was considering leaving for the suburbs, given the high costs of occupying office space in midtown, but ultimately decided against it. [S180] The Whitney branch in Equitable Tower closed in 1992, when its original agreement expired, and it was replaced by an art gallery called the Equitable Gallery. [S181] Sam's Restaurant closed the next year, being replaced by another American grill, Judson Grill, in early 1994. [S182] Equitable only occupied ten percent of 787 Seventh Avenue by early 1995, when it placed 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of space for lease. [S183] That year, Equitable announced it would be moving one block east to 1290 Sixth Avenue, with only the highest-ranking executives remaining at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S184] Much of Equitable's space at 787 Seventh Avenue was taken by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the floor just below the penthouse was occupied by Paramount Capital. [S185] With Equitable's relocation, the *America Today* murals were moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue. [S186] In the late 1990s, David Emil planned to open a restaurant called Night Sky on the 50th floor, but it was canceled after Equitable wished to lease that floor as offices. [S187] The 1997 chess match of Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov, in which IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, took place at Equitable Center as well. [S188] By 2000, the building's tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, Hicks Muse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher. [S189] About a third of the total space, 500,000 square feet (46,000\u00a0m\u00b2), was set to become available for lease in 2002 when Ernst & Young's lease expired. [S190] Much of Ernst & Young's space was taken in 2001 by law firm Sidley Austin, which had to renovate 11 floors within two months after its old World Trade Center offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. [S191] Another lessee that had been displaced from the World Trade Center was investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which borrowed space from BNP Paribas and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz before leasing its own fourth-floor space. [S192] The Palio restaurant closed in 2002, and Judson Grill closed two years later; the latter was replaced by Bar Americain. [S193] Citigroup leased a major block of space, covering 250,000 square feet (23,000\u00a0m\u00b2), in late 2005, including the 50th-floor penthouse. [S194] Other tenants in the 2000s included investment manager New Mountain Capital as well as IT company SAS Institute. [S195] ### 2010s to present\n\nPalio's space became part of Piano Due, which closed in 2011 and was replaced by the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar in 2014. [S196] Axa Equitable placed 787 Seventh Avenue and 1285 Sixth Avenue for sale in August 2015. [S197] At the time, 787 Seventh Avenue was almost completely occupied, with only 1.6 percent of the space vacant. [S198] By the end of the year, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) had shown interest in acquiring 787 Seventh Avenue for $1.9 billion. [S199] This would make Axa Equitable Center one of the most expensive single buildings to ever be sold in New York City. [S200] In February 2016, CalPERS announced it had purchased the building. [S201] The purchase was financed with a $780 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n# Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n\n**Axa Equitable Center** (originally the **Equitable Tower** or **Equitable Center West**) is an office skyscraper at 787 Seventh Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S2] Completed in 1986 and designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the building measures 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S3] Equitable Center West was developed by the Equitable Life Assurance Society (later renamed Equitable Holdings, part of Axa) adjacent to Equitable's existing skyscraper at 1285 Avenue of the Americas. [S4] The facade is clad in granite, applied in a two-tone pattern of white horizontal and red vertical bands. [S5] The building has three setbacks, as well as a penthouse at the top with arched windows. [S6] Equitable acquired an extensive collection of artwork to display in the building's public spaces. [S7] There is a public galleria from 51st to 52nd Street, which forms part of 6\u00bd Avenue, as well as an arched entrance atrium from Seventh Avenue. [S8] The complex also includes an underground concourse, several restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. [S9] The building was proposed in the early 1980s and, after the site was acquired, Equitable's board approved the plans for the tower in 1983. [S10] When the tower opened, the company's corporate offices occupied about a third of the space, and the ground story had commercial concerns such as the Le Bernardin restaurant and a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S11] Equitable only used the tower as its headquarters until the late 1990s, and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) acquired Axa Equitable Center in 2016. [S12] ## Site\n\n787 Seventh (formerly known as the AXA Equitable Building) is at 787 Seventh Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S13] The building's rectangular land lot occupies the western half of the city block bounded by Seventh Avenue to the west, 51st Street to the south, Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) to the east, and 52nd Street to the north. [S14] The site covers 80,333 square feet (7,463.2\u00a0m\u00b2), with a frontage of 200 feet (61\u00a0m) on Seventh Avenue and 400 feet (120\u00a0m) along the side streets. [S15] Adjacent is 1285 Avenue of the Americas (1285 Sixth Avenue; Equitable Center East), designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and constructed from 1959 to 1961. [S16] The Sixth Avenue building occupies the eastern half of the city block. [S17] The sidewalk in front of the building is made of pink granite, extending eastward in front of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S18] The sidewalks adjacent to 1285 Sixth Avenue comprise Urban Plaza North and South, designed by Scott Burton. [S19] Axa Equitable Center is also near 810 Seventh Avenue to the northwest, the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel and Flatotel New York City to the north, Credit Lyonnais Building to the northeast, 1271 Avenue of the Americas to the southeast, The Michelangelo to the south, and the Winter Garden Theatre to the southwest. [S20] The site occupied by Axa Equitable Center had contained the Victoria and Abbey hotels just before the skyscraper's construction. [S21] ## Architecture\n\nAxa Equitable Center was designed in the postmodern style by Edward Larrabee Barnes for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. [S22] The building is 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S23] Severud Associates was the structural engineer and Turner Construction was the main contractor. [S24] The structure uses 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of stone and 28,000 short tons (25,000 long tons; 25,000\u00a0t) of steel. [S25] Rather than dictate the precise style for the building, Equitable CEO John B. [S26] Carter had requested only that Barnes create \"a top-quality building\". [S27] Nonetheless, Carter had specific requests for several of the interior spaces.",

        "[S177] By 1990, Equitable was in the process of being acquired by the French company Axa. [S178] Within two years, Equitable had gone public and downsized most of its employees, leaving only 2,200 working at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S179] The company was considering leaving for the suburbs, given the high costs of occupying office space in midtown, but ultimately decided against it. [S180] The Whitney branch in Equitable Tower closed in 1992, when its original agreement expired, and it was replaced by an art gallery called the Equitable Gallery. [S181] Sam's Restaurant closed the next year, being replaced by another American grill, Judson Grill, in early 1994. [S182] Equitable only occupied ten percent of 787 Seventh Avenue by early 1995, when it placed 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of space for lease. [S183] That year, Equitable announced it would be moving one block east to 1290 Sixth Avenue, with only the highest-ranking executives remaining at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S184] Much of Equitable's space at 787 Seventh Avenue was taken by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the floor just below the penthouse was occupied by Paramount Capital. [S185] With Equitable's relocation, the *America Today* murals were moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue. [S186] In the late 1990s, David Emil planned to open a restaurant called Night Sky on the 50th floor, but it was canceled after Equitable wished to lease that floor as offices. [S187] The 1997 chess match of Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov, in which IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, took place at Equitable Center as well. [S188] By 2000, the building's tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, Hicks Muse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher. [S189] About a third of the total space, 500,000 square feet (46,000\u00a0m\u00b2), was set to become available for lease in 2002 when Ernst & Young's lease expired. [S190] Much of Ernst & Young's space was taken in 2001 by law firm Sidley Austin, which had to renovate 11 floors within two months after its old World Trade Center offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. [S191] Another lessee that had been displaced from the World Trade Center was investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which borrowed space from BNP Paribas and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz before leasing its own fourth-floor space. [S192] The Palio restaurant closed in 2002, and Judson Grill closed two years later; the latter was replaced by Bar Americain. [S193] Citigroup leased a major block of space, covering 250,000 square feet (23,000\u00a0m\u00b2), in late 2005, including the 50th-floor penthouse. [S194] Other tenants in the 2000s included investment manager New Mountain Capital as well as IT company SAS Institute. [S195] ### 2010s to present\n\nPalio's space became part of Piano Due, which closed in 2011 and was replaced by the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar in 2014. [S196] Axa Equitable placed 787 Seventh Avenue and 1285 Sixth Avenue for sale in August 2015. [S197] At the time, 787 Seventh Avenue was almost completely occupied, with only 1.6 percent of the space vacant.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the original name of the Axa Equitable Center and how its ownership and tenant composition evolved from the 1990s to the 2000s.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the building was originally called \"Equitable Tower\" or \"Equitable Center West\" in Passage 2, specifically in sentence S1. That's the original name.\n\nNow, for the ownership and tenant changes. Let's start with the 1990s. From Passage 1, S177 says that by 1990, Equitable was being acquired by Axa. Then in S178, by 1992, Equitable went public and downsized. There's mention of them considering moving to the suburbs but staying. The Whitney branch closed in 1992 (S180), and Sam's Restaurant closed in 1993 (S181). By 1995, they only occupied 10% of the space and leased 300k sq ft (S182). They moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue in 1995 (S183), leaving some space to law firms like Willkie Farr & Gallagher (S184). The America Today murals were moved with them (S185). In the late 90s, there was a plan for a restaurant on the 50th floor that didn't happen (S186), and the 1997 chess match was there (S187). By 2000, tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, etc. (S188). In 2002, Ernst & Young's lease expired, leading to some space being taken by Sidley Austin (S189, S190). Other tenants like Keefe, Bruyette & Woods moved in (S191). Restaurants like Palio and Judson Grill closed, replaced by others (S192, S193). Citigroup leased space in 2005 (S194), and other tenants in the 2000s included New Mountain Capital and SAS Institute (S195).\n\nOwnership changes: The building was originally Equitable, then acquired by Axa by 1990 (S177). Later, in 2016, CalPERS bought it (S191, S199, S200, S201). \n\nSo putting it all together, the original name is Equitable Tower or Equitable Center West. Ownership shifted from Equitable to Axa, then to CalPERS. Tenants evolved from having Equitable as the main occupant, then leasing space to law firms, other companies, and restaurants, with changes in tenants over the years as companies moved in or out."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S89] Leading from Seventh Avenue is a five-story atrium, which serves as the main lobby. [S90] The atrium is an 80-foot (24\u00a0m) cube. [S91] Its large size is in part due to a commercial holdout who did not leave the site until construction had already started. [S92] At the center of the atrium, Burton designed *Atrium Furnishment*, which consists of a 40-foot-wide (12\u00a0m) marble semicircular banquette and a circular marble fountain with trees. [S93] Though the atrium in general has a white marble floor, *Atrium Furnishment* is surrounded by red granite pavers, which were intended to provide a contrast between the circular artwork and the cubical atrium. [S94] A bronze band surrounds the artwork as well. [S95] On the eastern wall of the atrium, facing the main archway on Seventh Avenue, is a Lichtenstein artwork, *Mural with Blue Brushstroke*, which measures 68 by 32 feet (20.7 by 9.8\u00a0m). [S96] Lichtenstein had painted the mural on-site in 1986. [S97] A pair of parallel passageways leads east from the atrium to the galleria, each originally decorated with a separate artwork.

[S108] Another tenant was the Cathedral of St. [S109] John the Divine, which operated two stores with souvenirs from the city's museums. [S110] The Urbanspace food hall has also operated at ground level since 2020. [S111] From the building's opening in early 1986, Equitable officials wanted to operate what *Newsday* described as \"nothing but the best of restaurants\". [S112] Initially, there was an Italian restaurant called Palio and a French restaurant called Le Bernardin. [S113] Palio's ground-floor bar measured 30 by 30 feet (9.1 by 9.1\u00a0m), with a 24-foot-tall (7.3\u00a0m) ceiling, and its second floor contained a dining room.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S150] Equitable's board officially approved plans in February 1983 to move its headquarters to a Seventh Avenue building. [S151] Edward Larrabee Barnes was hired as the architect. [S152] Equitable's new tower was one of several high-rise developments planned for the area at the time, in spite of a slight decline in New York City's office market. [S153] Equitable planned to sell its Sixth Avenue headquarters to get a tax deduction on the new building. [S154] The old Sixth Avenue structure would be partially occupied by Paine Webber. [S155] Equitable officials were not worried about the fact that Seventh Avenue was not a prestigious executive address. [S156] This was a contrast to two decades earlier, when officials had thought Sixth Avenue was \"more like Speakeasy Row than Corporate Corridor\". [S157] While much of the building was to be completed by 1985, the section at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 52nd Street was occupied by an eight-story building and would be delayed. [S158] Construction of Equitable Tower had to be closely coordinated to avoid delays or disruptions, since even a one-month delay in completion would cost Equitable $6 million in rent and $3 million in construction loans. [S159] Work was complicated by the fact that traffic on the neighboring streets could not be disrupted during construction. [S160] On two sides of the construction site, there was only 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m) of space within which builders could work, and there was no space for materials to be stored on site. [S161] Equitable president John B. [S162] Carter announced in May 1985 that a series of artworks would be commissioned for the building. [S163] During construction that July, a construction hoist fell from Equitable Tower and killed two workers. [S164] ### Opening and early years\n\nBy early 1986, Equitable had finished the atrium, galleria, plazas, and lobby, as well as a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S165] The company had taken the top third of the building and expected to rent out the remaining stories at a rate of $40 to $50 per square foot ($430 to $540/m\u00b2), a higher rate than at nearby office buildings. [S166] At the time, there were few tenants for the west tower's vacant space, and Equitable was marketing both the west and east towers as part of the same complex. [S167] The building ultimately cost $200 million to construct. [S168] A public preview of the new tower's boardrooms took place on February 1, 1986, as part of a benefit event for the Center for Arts Information. [S169] The Whitney branch opened on February 11, 1986. [S170] Douglas McGill of *The New York Times* called the Whitney branch the \"latest and largest addition to an extensive collaboration between a major art museum and the corporate world.\"\n\nThe building was technically owned by Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, which leased space to Equitable for its own corporate offices. [S171] Within a year of Equitable Tower's opening, eighty percent of the space had been leased. [S172] Among the tenants were arts organizations American Council for the Arts, Center for Arts Information, and Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, which were offered below-market-rate rents. [S173] In addition, accounting firm Ernst & Whinney (later Ernst & Young) took space in the tower. [S174] By October 1987, when Black Monday occurred, Equitable Tower was fully leased despite charging higher rents per square foot than other buildings in the area. [S175] The American grill Sam's Restaurant opened at ground level at the end of that year. [S176] ### 1990s and 2000s\n\nPassage 2:\n[S28] For Equitable Tower's construction, Equitable acquired $7 million or $7.5 million worth of artwork to display in both public and private spaces. [S29] The work includes large murals by Sol LeWitt and Roy Lichtenstein and sculptures by Scott Burton and Barry Flanagan. [S30] In addition, works by Milton Avery, George Bellows, James E. [S31] Buttersworth, Marsden Hartley, and Alex Katz decorated the offices. [S32] Some works, such as a mobile by Alexander Calder and the bronze sculpture *Day* by Paul Manship, were already in Equitable's art collection when Equitable Tower was built. [S33] Equitable hired several experts, including art consultant Emily Braun, to assist in arranging the artwork. [S34] Equitable publications referred to 787 Seventh Avenue, along with 1285 Sixth Avenue, as \"one square block of art\". [S35] ### Form and facade\n\nThe entire building is set back 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) from the street on each side. [S36] A public galleria runs from north to south, dividing the lowest six floors of the building. [S37] The seventh and eighth stories span the north and south ends of the galleria. [S38] The north and south elevations rise with three setbacks, while the west and east elevations rise without setbacks. [S39] The setbacks on the north and south elevations are placed at the 12th, 34th, and 50th stories, with each setback being 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) deep. [S40] Barnes intended for the setbacks to recall those on 30 Rockefeller Plaza and the International Building, two of Rockefeller Center's tallest buildings. [S41] One of the early plans for Axa Equitable Center, which was illustrated in a monograph of Barnes's work, was for the massing to instead contain setbacks on the west and east, with the north and south elevations rising as a slab-like wall from the street. [S42] In a subsequent iteration of the plans, Barnes had planned deep porches at the setbacks. [S43] The facade is made of limestone, granite, and glass. [S44] The Indiana limestone and Brazilian granite on the facade is applied in a two-tone pattern. [S45] The vertical pilasters are clad with reddish-brown granite, which is also used for some horizontal bands just below each setback. [S46] The pilasters divide the facades into horizontal spandrel bands of buff-colored limestone, which alternate with glass windows on each floor. [S47] Barnes had used these materials because they harmonized with the colors and materials used on the neighboring buildings. [S48] Axa Equitable Center uses 5,800 panes of glass on its facade. [S49] The main entrance on Seventh Avenue is set within a semicircular-headed arch measuring 72 feet (22\u00a0m) tall. [S50] There is a loading dock at the eastern end of the 52nd Street elevation. [S51] There are double-height mechanical spaces at each setback. [S52] These double-height floors contain recessed windows to give the impression that the red pilasters are massive piers; the recessed windows were inspired by those in Art Deco buildings. [S53] The recessed windows on the double-height floors also wrap around to the west and east elevations. [S54] The topmost penthouse is embellished with large triumphal-arched windows on its west and east elevations, which illuminate the Equitable boardrooms. [S55] The boardroom windows measure 42 feet (13\u00a0m) in diameter and 53 feet (16\u00a0m) tall. [S56] While the original plan had been to use ocular windows, Barnes instead used triumphal arches because they allowed more light to enter the boardroom spaces. [S57] ### Galleria and concourse",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the integration of artwork and architectural elements influenced the building's identity and tenant attraction, and its role in long-term success. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Let me scan through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with Passage 1: There's a mention of Equitable president John B. Carter announcing in May 1985 that a series of artworks would be commissioned for the building (S162). Also, in Passage 2, there's a lot about the artwork. For example, S28 says they acquired $7 million or $7.5 million worth of artwork, including works by famous artists like Sol LeWitt, Roy Lichtenstein, etc. (S29). Additionally, S34 mentions hiring art consultant Emily Braun. The building was referred to as \"one square block of art\" in S35. \n\nThen, looking at the architectural elements: The facade details in Passage 2, like the use of limestone, granite, glass, and the setbacks inspired by Rockefeller Center (S40). The galleria and public spaces are mentioned in S36, which divides the lowest six floors. The main entrance's arch (S49) and the design elements like pilasters and spandrel bands (S46-S47). The double-height mechanical spaces with recessed windows (S52) and the triumphal-arched windows (S54-S55) are also part of the architecture.\n\nNow, how did these elements influence the building's identity and tenant attraction? The artwork likely enhanced the building's aesthetic appeal, making it a cultural hub. The mention of the Whitney Museum branch (S169) and arts organizations as tenants (S173) suggests that the artwork attracted such tenants. The architectural design, with its public galleria and unique facade, might have made the building stand out, contributing to its identity. \n\nFor tenant attraction, the passage states that Equitable expected to rent out spaces at higher rates but still managed to lease 80% within a year (S172). The presence of arts organizations and the building's unique features could have made it attractive. Also, despite higher rents, it was fully leased by 1987 (S175). The integration of art and architecture probably played a role in making the building desirable, leading to long-term success.\n\nCitations needed: The artwork integration is covered in S28, S29, S35, S34. The architectural elements in S36, S40, S46, S47, S49, S54, S55. The tenant attraction and success are in S172, S173, S175. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing these sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with appropriate citations. Check if each citation is correctly linked. For example, the artwork's role in identity and attraction would cite S28, S29, S35, S34. The architectural elements' influence would cite S36, S40, S46, S47, S49, S54, S55. The tenant attraction and success would cite S172, S173, S175."

[S46] The pilasters divide the facades into horizontal spandrel bands of buff-colored limestone, which alternate with glass windows on each floor. [S47] Barnes had used these materials because they harmonized with the colors and materials used on the neighboring buildings. [S48] Axa Equitable Center uses 5,800 panes of glass on its facade. [S49] The main entrance on Seventh Avenue is set within a semicircular-headed arch measuring 72 feet (22\u00a0m) tall. [S50] There is a loading dock at the eastern end of the 52nd Street elevation. [S51] There are double-height mechanical spaces at each setback. [S52] These double-height floors contain recessed windows to give the impression that the red pilasters are massive piers; the recessed windows were inspired by those in Art Deco buildings. [S53] The recessed windows on the double-height floors also wrap around to the west and east elevations. [S54] The topmost penthouse is embellished with large triumphal-arched windows on its west and east elevations, which illuminate the Equitable boardrooms. [S55] The boardroom windows measure 42 feet (13\u00a0m) in diameter and 53 feet (16\u00a0m) tall. [S56] While the original plan had been to use ocular windows, Barnes instead used triumphal arches because they allowed more light to enter the boardroom spaces. [S57] ### Galleria and concourse"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the construction timeline and financial risks influenced Equitable's strategic decisions during the Axa Equitable Center's development and what the outcomes were.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage for mentions of construction timeline, financial risks, strategic decisions, and outcomes. Let me go through each sentence step by step.\n\nLooking at the first passage, there's a lot of info. Let's check each sentence:\n\n[S158] mentions that a one-month delay would cost $6 million in rent and $3 million in construction loans. That's a financial risk directly tied to the timeline. So this sentence shows that financial risks (costs from delays) influenced their planning. The citation here is [S158].\n\n[S159] talks about traffic restrictions complicating construction. This relates to the timeline, as they had to coordinate carefully to avoid delays. So this is about the construction timeline's challenges. Citation [S159].\n\n[S160] and [S161] describe the tight working space, which would affect the construction timeline. These are constraints that would influence their strategy to manage the timeline. Citations [S160][S161].\n\n[S163] mentions a construction hoist falling, leading to deaths. This is a safety issue, but maybe also a risk that could delay the project. However, the passage doesn't explicitly link this to strategic decisions, so maybe not directly relevant here.\n\nLooking at the outcomes, [S172] states that within a year, 80% of space was leased. [S175] says by 1987, it was fully leased despite higher rents. These are positive outcomes. Also, [S171] mentions the building was owned by a subsidiary, which might be a strategic decision. But the question is about how timeline and financial risks influenced decisions. \n\nThe financial risks (costs of delays) would push Equitable to manage the timeline closely. The tight space (S160, S161) would require careful planning to avoid delays. The outcome was successful leasing despite higher rents, possibly due to strategic marketing (S166). \n\nAnother point: [S153] mentions selling the old building for a tax deduction. That's a financial strategy, but not directly about timeline risks. However, the tax deduction might have influenced the timing of the project. But the question is about construction timeline and financial risks during development. \n\nSo, the key points are the financial risks (costs of delays) and the tight construction timeline constraints. The outcomes include successful leasing and the building's completion despite challenges. \n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the relevant citations. For example, the financial risks are cited in [S158], the construction challenges in [S159][S160][S161], and the outcomes in [S172][S175]."

The passage starts by mentioning the atrium's size. Sentence [S90] says it's an 80-foot cube. Then, sentence [S91] explains that the large size is partly due to a commercial holdout who didn't leave until construction started. That's one factor. \n\nNext, the design elements. The atrium has *Atrium Furnishment* by Burton, which includes a marble banquette and fountain. The red granite pavers around it (S93) contrast with the white marble floor, and there's a bronze band (S94). These elements probably contribute to the design. \n\nThen there's the Lichtenstein artwork on the eastern wall (S95), which is a mural. The Benton murals in the passageways (S98-S100) and Manship's sculpture (S101-S103) are other artworks. The question is how these reflect the building's intentions. The atrium's design with contrasting materials and the placement of art might aim to create a dynamic, artistic space. The Lichtenstein mural being on the main wall facing the entrance could highlight the building's commitment to contemporary art. The Benton murals, originally from another location, might indicate a focus on integrating existing art into the new space. \n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. The size factor is [S91], the design elements like the banquette and pavers are [S92][S93][S94]. The Lichtenstein artwork is [S95], Benton's murals [S98][S99], and Manship's sculpture [S101][S102]. \n\nWait, the question also asks how the artwork reflects the building's intentions. The passage mentions that the red granite and bronze were intended to contrast the artwork with the atrium's cube shape. The Lichtenstein mural's placement and the inclusion of existing artworks like Benton's might show a blend of contemporary and historical art, emphasizing the building's role as a cultural hub. \n\nI should structure the answer into two parts: factors for the atrium's design and size, and the artwork's reflection of intentions. Each sentence should have the relevant citations. Let me check again to ensure all citations are correctly attributed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the restaurant offerings at the Axa Equitable Center changed over time and what remains of the original establishments. I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of restaurants. There's a section under \"Retail and restaurants\" that starts with the Whitney Museum branch and then talks about restaurants. Let me check those sentences.\n\nSentence [S112] mentions that from the building's opening in 1986, Equitable wanted \"nothing but the best of restaurants.\" Initially, there was Palio (Italian) and Le Bernardin (French). Then [S113] gives details about Palio's bar and dining room. [S114] says the former bar room's walls have a mural by Sandro Chia. [S115] notes that Le Bernardin was Michelin-starred with velvet upholstery. \n\nThen [S117] mentions a third restaurant, Sam's Restaurant, opened in 1987. Later, [S118] states that Le Bernardin continued in the 2010s, but the old Palio space became Aldo Sohm Wine Bar since 2014. [S119] says Sam's was replaced by Judson Grill and then Bar Americain.\n\nSo the changes are: Palio and Le Bernardin were there initially, then Palio's space became Aldo Sohm, Sam's was replaced by Judson Grill and Bar Americain. Le Bernardin remained. What remains? Le Bernardin is still there, and the Palio mural might still be in the Aldo Sohm space. Also, the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar is in the old Palio space, so maybe the mural is still there. The passage doesn't mention if the mural was removed, so maybe it's still present. \n\nI need to structure the answer with the changes over time and what remains. Citations would be [S112]-[S119] for the changes and [S114] for the mural remaining. Also, check if any other sentences mention remaining elements. The passage says \"the former bar room's walls still contain a mural\" so that's a citation. Le Bernardin's continued operation is mentioned in [S118]. \n\nSo the answer would state that initially there were Palio, Le Bernardin, and Sam's. Over time, Palio became Aldo Sohm, Sam's was replaced, but Le Bernardin remains. The mural from Palio is still there. Citations for each part."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S177] By 1990, Equitable was in the process of being acquired by the French company Axa. [S178] Within two years, Equitable had gone public and downsized most of its employees, leaving only 2,200 working at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S179] The company was considering leaving for the suburbs, given the high costs of occupying office space in midtown, but ultimately decided against it. [S180] The Whitney branch in Equitable Tower closed in 1992, when its original agreement expired, and it was replaced by an art gallery called the Equitable Gallery. [S181] Sam's Restaurant closed the next year, being replaced by another American grill, Judson Grill, in early 1994. [S182] Equitable only occupied ten percent of 787 Seventh Avenue by early 1995, when it placed 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of space for lease. [S183] That year, Equitable announced it would be moving one block east to 1290 Sixth Avenue, with only the highest-ranking executives remaining at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S184] Much of Equitable's space at 787 Seventh Avenue was taken by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the floor just below the penthouse was occupied by Paramount Capital. [S185] With Equitable's relocation, the *America Today* murals were moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue. [S186] In the late 1990s, David Emil planned to open a restaurant called Night Sky on the 50th floor, but it was canceled after Equitable wished to lease that floor as offices. [S187] The 1997 chess match of Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov, in which IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, took place at Equitable Center as well. [S188] By 2000, the building's tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, Hicks Muse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher. [S189] About a third of the total space, 500,000 square feet (46,000\u00a0m\u00b2), was set to become available for lease in 2002 when Ernst & Young's lease expired. [S190] Much of Ernst & Young's space was taken in 2001 by law firm Sidley Austin, which had to renovate 11 floors within two months after its old World Trade Center offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. [S191] Another lessee that had been displaced from the World Trade Center was investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which borrowed space from BNP Paribas and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz before leasing its own fourth-floor space. [S192] The Palio restaurant closed in 2002, and Judson Grill closed two years later; the latter was replaced by Bar Americain. [S193] Citigroup leased a major block of space, covering 250,000 square feet (23,000\u00a0m\u00b2), in late 2005, including the 50th-floor penthouse.

[S197] At the time, 787 Seventh Avenue was almost completely occupied, with only 1.6 percent of the space vacant. [S198] By the end of the year, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) had shown interest in acquiring 787 Seventh Avenue for $1.9 billion. [S199] This would make Axa Equitable Center one of the most expensive single buildings to ever be sold in New York City. [S200] In February 2016, CalPERS announced it had purchased the building. [S201] The purchase was financed with a $780 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n# Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n\n**Axa Equitable Center** (originally the **Equitable Tower** or **Equitable Center West**) is an office skyscraper at 787 Seventh Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S2] Completed in 1986 and designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the building measures 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S3] Equitable Center West was developed by the Equitable Life Assurance Society (later renamed Equitable Holdings, part of Axa) adjacent to Equitable's existing skyscraper at 1285 Avenue of the Americas. [S4] The facade is clad in granite, applied in a two-tone pattern of white horizontal and red vertical bands. [S5] The building has three setbacks, as well as a penthouse at the top with arched windows. [S6] Equitable acquired an extensive collection of artwork to display in the building's public spaces. [S7] There is a public galleria from 51st to 52nd Street, which forms part of 6\u00bd Avenue, as well as an arched entrance atrium from Seventh Avenue. [S8] The complex also includes an underground concourse, several restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. [S9] The building was proposed in the early 1980s and, after the site was acquired, Equitable's board approved the plans for the tower in 1983. [S10] When the tower opened, the company's corporate offices occupied about a third of the space, and the ground story had commercial concerns such as the Le Bernardin restaurant and a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S11] Equitable only used the tower as its headquarters until the late 1990s, and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) acquired Axa Equitable Center in 2016. [S12] ## Site\n\n787 Seventh (formerly known as the AXA Equitable Building) is at 787 Seventh Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S13] The building's rectangular land lot occupies the western half of the city block bounded by Seventh Avenue to the west, 51st Street to the south, Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) to the east, and 52nd Street to the north. [S14] The site covers 80,333 square feet (7,463.2\u00a0m\u00b2), with a frontage of 200 feet (61\u00a0m) on Seventh Avenue and 400 feet (120\u00a0m) along the side streets. [S15] Adjacent is 1285 Avenue of the Americas (1285 Sixth Avenue; Equitable Center East), designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and constructed from 1959 to 1961. [S16] The Sixth Avenue building occupies the eastern half of the city block. [S17] The sidewalk in front of the building is made of pink granite, extending eastward in front of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S18] The sidewalks adjacent to 1285 Sixth Avenue comprise Urban Plaza North and South, designed by Scott Burton. [S19] Axa Equitable Center is also near 810 Seventh Avenue to the northwest, the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel and Flatotel New York City to the north, Credit Lyonnais Building to the northeast, 1271 Avenue of the Americas to the southeast, The Michelangelo to the south, and the Winter Garden Theatre to the southwest. [S20] The site occupied by Axa Equitable Center had contained the Victoria and Abbey hotels just before the skyscraper's construction. [S21] ## Architecture\n\nAxa Equitable Center was designed in the postmodern style by Edward Larrabee Barnes for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. [S22] The building is 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S23] Severud Associates was the structural engineer and Turner Construction was the main contractor. [S24] The structure uses 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of stone and 28,000 short tons (25,000 long tons; 25,000\u00a0t) of steel. [S25] Rather than dictate the precise style for the building, Equitable CEO John B. [S26] Carter had requested only that Barnes create \"a top-quality building\". [S27] Nonetheless, Carter had specific requests for several of the interior spaces.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the architectural features of the Axa Equitable Center and how its occupancy and lease dynamics changed from the early 1990s to the 2010s. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Passage 1 seems to focus more on the occupancy changes and lease dynamics over time, while Passage 2 describes the architectural features.\n\nStarting with the architectural features. Looking at Passage 2, there are several sentences that mention the design. For example, [S2] says it's 752 feet tall with 54 stories. [S4] mentions the facade is granite with white horizontal and red vertical bands. [S5] talks about three setbacks and a penthouse with arched windows. [S7] mentions a public galleria and arched entrance atrium. [S8] notes an underground concourse, restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. Also, [S22] states it's postmodern style by Edward Larrabee Barnes. So those are the key architectural elements.\n\nNow, the occupancy and lease dynamics from the early 90s to 2010s. Passage 1 has a lot of info. In the early 90s, Equitable was downsizing, as per [S178], and by 1995, they only occupied 10% of the building, leasing 300k sq ft [S182]. They moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue in 1995 [S183], so that's a major change. Then in the late 90s, there were changes in tenants like Willkie Farr & Gallagher taking over space [S184], and the 1997 chess match [S187]. In the 2000s, Ernst & Young's lease expired in 2002 [S189], and Sidley Austin moved in after 9/11 [S190]. Citigroup leased space in 2005 [S193]. By the 2010s, the building was almost fully occupied [S197], and CalPERS bought it in 2016 [S199]. \n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. For architectural features, the sentences from Passage 2. For the occupancy changes, the relevant sentences from Passage 1. Also, check if any sentences in Passage 1 mention the 2010s, like [S197] and [S199] which talk about the sale in 2015 and occupancy rates.\n\nI should structure the answer into two parts: first the architectural features with their citations, then the occupancy changes with their citations. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with the appropriate citations. Need to ensure that each sentence is properly attributed and that the citations are in the correct format."

The user is asking about an event involving a technological milestone at the Equitable Center in 1997 and how the building's lease availability and tenant shifts reflected broader economic or corporate changes in the late 90s and 2000s.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has a lot of sentences with citations. Let me scan through them for the year 1997. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, sentence [S187] mentions: \"The 1997 chess match of Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov, in which IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, took place at Equitable Center as well.\" That seems like the technological milestone event. So the answer to the first part is the Deep Blue vs. Garry Kasparov chess match.\n\nNow, the second part of the question is about how the building's lease availability and tenant shifts reflected broader economic or corporate changes. Let me check the sentences around the late 90s and 2000s. \n\nIn Passage 1, [S182] says Equitable placed 300,000 sq ft for lease in 1995, moving to 1290 Sixth Avenue. [S183] mentions the move, and [S184] talks about law firms taking over space. Then in [S186], there's a mention of a restaurant plan on the 50th floor that was canceled because Equitable wanted that space. \n\nIn the late 90s, [S187] is the chess match. Then in [S188], by 2000, tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, etc. [S189] mentions 500,000 sq ft available in 2002 when Ernst & Young's lease expired. [S190] says Sidley Austin took over in 2001 after 9/11. [S191] mentions Keefe, Bruyette & Woods displaced from WTC. [S193] Palio and Judson Grill closing, replaced by others. [S194] Citigroup leasing space in 2005. [S195] mentions IT company SAS Institute. \n\nThese changes reflect things like companies downsizing, moving due to costs, post-9/11 relocations, and tech companies moving in. The lease availability shows the building adapting to corporate needs, maybe more flexible spaces. Tenant shifts like law firms and financial companies moving in and out could indicate economic shifts, maybe the tech boom, or the aftermath of 9/11 affecting office spaces. Also, the sale in 2015 at a high price shows the building's value and possibly the real estate market trends.\n\nSo, putting it together, the technological event is the Deep Blue match. The lease and tenant changes reflect corporate relocations, downsizing, post-9/11 adjustments, and the rise of tech and financial firms. The citations would be [S187] for the event, and then various others for the lease and tenant shifts. Need to make sure each statement cites the correct sentences."

[S201] The purchase was financed with a $780 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n# Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n\n**Axa Equitable Center** (originally the **Equitable Tower** or **Equitable Center West**) is an office skyscraper at 787 Seventh Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S2] Completed in 1986 and designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the building measures 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S3] Equitable Center West was developed by the Equitable Life Assurance Society (later renamed Equitable Holdings, part of Axa) adjacent to Equitable's existing skyscraper at 1285 Avenue of the Americas. [S4] The facade is clad in granite, applied in a two-tone pattern of white horizontal and red vertical bands. [S5] The building has three setbacks, as well as a penthouse at the top with arched windows. [S6] Equitable acquired an extensive collection of artwork to display in the building's public spaces. [S7] There is a public galleria from 51st to 52nd Street, which forms part of 6\u00bd Avenue, as well as an arched entrance atrium from Seventh Avenue. [S8] The complex also includes an underground concourse, several restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. [S9] The building was proposed in the early 1980s and, after the site was acquired, Equitable's board approved the plans for the tower in 1983. [S10] When the tower opened, the company's corporate offices occupied about a third of the space, and the ground story had commercial concerns such as the Le Bernardin restaurant and a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S11] Equitable only used the tower as its headquarters until the late 1990s, and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) acquired Axa Equitable Center in 2016. [S12] ## Site\n\n787 Seventh (formerly known as the AXA Equitable Building) is at 787 Seventh Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S13] The building's rectangular land lot occupies the western half of the city block bounded by Seventh Avenue to the west, 51st Street to the south, Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) to the east, and 52nd Street to the north. [S14] The site covers 80,333 square feet (7,463.2\u00a0m\u00b2), with a frontage of 200 feet (61\u00a0m) on Seventh Avenue and 400 feet (120\u00a0m) along the side streets. [S15] Adjacent is 1285 Avenue of the Americas (1285 Sixth Avenue; Equitable Center East), designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and constructed from 1959 to 1961. [S16] The Sixth Avenue building occupies the eastern half of the city block. [S17] The sidewalk in front of the building is made of pink granite, extending eastward in front of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S18] The sidewalks adjacent to 1285 Sixth Avenue comprise Urban Plaza North and South, designed by Scott Burton. [S19] Axa Equitable Center is also near 810 Seventh Avenue to the northwest, the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel and Flatotel New York City to the north, Credit Lyonnais Building to the northeast, 1271 Avenue of the Americas to the southeast, The Michelangelo to the south, and the Winter Garden Theatre to the southwest. [S20] The site occupied by Axa Equitable Center had contained the Victoria and Abbey hotels just before the skyscraper's construction. [S21] ## Architecture\n\nAxa Equitable Center was designed in the postmodern style by Edward Larrabee Barnes for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. [S22] The building is 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S23] Severud Associates was the structural engineer and Turner Construction was the main contractor. [S24] The structure uses 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of stone and 28,000 short tons (25,000 long tons; 25,000\u00a0t) of steel. [S25] Rather than dictate the precise style for the building, Equitable CEO John B. [S26] Carter had requested only that Barnes create \"a top-quality building\". [S27] Nonetheless, Carter had specific requests for several of the interior spaces.",

        "[S177] By 1990, Equitable was in the process of being acquired by the French company Axa. [S178] Within two years, Equitable had gone public and downsized most of its employees, leaving only 2,200 working at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S179] The company was considering leaving for the suburbs, given the high costs of occupying office space in midtown, but ultimately decided against it. [S180] The Whitney branch in Equitable Tower closed in 1992, when its original agreement expired, and it was replaced by an art gallery called the Equitable Gallery. [S181] Sam's Restaurant closed the next year, being replaced by another American grill, Judson Grill, in early 1994. [S182] Equitable only occupied ten percent of 787 Seventh Avenue by early 1995, when it placed 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of space for lease. [S183] That year, Equitable announced it would be moving one block east to 1290 Sixth Avenue, with only the highest-ranking executives remaining at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S184] Much of Equitable's space at 787 Seventh Avenue was taken by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the floor just below the penthouse was occupied by Paramount Capital. [S185] With Equitable's relocation, the *America Today* murals were moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue. [S186] In the late 1990s, David Emil planned to open a restaurant called Night Sky on the 50th floor, but it was canceled after Equitable wished to lease that floor as offices. [S187] The 1997 chess match of Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov, in which IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, took place at Equitable Center as well. [S188] By 2000, the building's tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, Hicks Muse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher. [S189] About a third of the total space, 500,000 square feet (46,000\u00a0m\u00b2), was set to become available for lease in 2002 when Ernst & Young's lease expired. [S190] Much of Ernst & Young's space was taken in 2001 by law firm Sidley Austin, which had to renovate 11 floors within two months after its old World Trade Center offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. [S191] Another lessee that had been displaced from the World Trade Center was investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which borrowed space from BNP Paribas and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz before leasing its own fourth-floor space.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the historical and cultural elements integrated into the Axa Equitable Center's design and how these elements interacted with its evolving use as a corporate and public space.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Passage 1 talks about the building's history, tenant changes, and events. Passage 2 describes the building's architecture, design, and some cultural aspects.\n\nLooking for historical elements: The building was originally called Equitable Tower and was developed by Equitable Life Assurance Society. It was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes in the postmodern style. The construction was completed in 1986. There's mention of the building's facade with granite in a two-tone pattern, three setbacks, a penthouse with arched windows. Also, there's a public galleria and an arched entrance atrium. The building has an underground concourse, restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. \n\nCultural elements: The passage mentions that Equitable acquired an extensive collection of artwork for public spaces. There was a Whitney Museum branch in the building, which closed in 1992, and it was replaced by the Equitable Gallery. There's also the *America Today* murals that were moved when Equitable relocated. Additionally, the building hosted the 1997 chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov. The presence of restaurants like Le Bernardin, Sam's Restaurant, Judson Grill, Palio, and later Bar Americain indicate cultural aspects related to dining. The corporate auditorium might also be a cultural space.\n\nNow, how did these elements interact with its evolving use? The building started as a corporate headquarters for Equitable, but over time, it became a mixed-use space with various tenants, including law firms, banks, and restaurants. The art collections and galleries (Whitney branch, Equitable Gallery, *America Today* murals) were part of the cultural elements. The relocation of Equitable and the subsequent leasing of spaces to other companies and the change in restaurant tenants show the evolution. The building's design, with public spaces and art, probably contributed to its role as both a corporate and public space. The chess match event also highlights its use as a public or cultural venue.\n\nI need to check the citations. For example, the design elements are in S2, S4, S5, S7, S8, S22. The artwork collection is in S6. The Whitney branch and Equitable Gallery are in S180 and S181. The *America Today* murals moved in S185. The chess match is in S187. The restaurants are mentioned in S180, S181, S192, S193, S194, etc.\n\nSo, the answer should list the historical elements like the building's construction, design by Barnes, postmodern style, granite facade, public spaces. Cultural elements include artwork, galleries, murals, restaurants, and events. The interaction with evolving use is the shift from corporate headquarters to a mixed-use space with various tenants and the adaptation of spaces for different purposes over time."

[S59] It is one of six passageways that form 6\u00bd Avenue, a set of full-block passageways from 51st to 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. [S60] The passageway was built as a \"through-block connection\" under the Special Midtown District, created in 1982. [S61] The space measures 45 feet (14\u00a0m) wide and 91 feet (28\u00a0m) tall underneath the north and south ends, where the seventh and eighth floors cross the galleria. [S62] The center of the space, beneath the skylights, is 124 feet (38\u00a0m) tall. [S63] Burton designed outdoor seating for the galleria. [S64] On the galleria's eastern wall is a passageway to 1285 Sixth Avenue's lobby, which originally connected with the Paine Webber Art Gallery in that building. [S65] The lobbies of 1285 Sixth Avenue and Equitable Center measured a combined 800 feet (240\u00a0m) long. [S66] An elevator lobby for the First National Bank of Chicago, just east of the galleria, contained Agnes Denes's artwork *Hypersphere: The Earth in the Shape of the Universe*, a set of 144 glass panels. [S67] LeWitt commissioned a set of six geometric artworks for the walls of the galleria entitled *Wall Drawing: Bands of Lines in Four Colors and Four Directions, Separated by Gray Bands*. [S68] As the name indicates, LeWitt's artwork consists of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal bands in four colors, created in acrylic paint on limestone. [S69] These works, which are up to 106 feet (32\u00a0m) high, are illuminated by natural light coming through the rooftop skylights. [S70] In addition, Flanagan designed two bronze sculptures at the galleria's north and south ends, each depicting animals in whimsical scenes.

[S72] mentions escalators from the galleria to Axa Center's basement concourse, and [S74] notes the connection to Rockefeller Center's underground concourse and the subway. \n\nAlso, [S60] mentions the galleria is part of 6\u00bd Avenue, a set of passageways, and [S61] describes the space's dimensions. The design of the galleria as a through-block connection (S60) and its role in connecting to other structures like Axa Center and Rockefeller Center (S72, S74) suggests that the lobbies' combined length contributes to the overall connectivity. The 800 feet of lobbies likely facilitate these connections, making the galleria a central hub. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other relevant sentences. [S65] is the key for the length, and the connections are covered in [S64], [S72], [S74], and the mention of 6\u00bd Avenue in [S59]. So the answer should cite [S65] for the length and [S64][S72][S74][S59][S60] for the design and connectivity aspects. \n\nWait, the user wants each sentence in the answer to have its own citations. So the statement about the combined length would cite [S65], and the part about the design and connectivity would need to reference the relevant sentences. But the question is asking for how the combined length relates to the galleria's design and connectivity. So maybe the answer is split into two parts: one stating the combined length with citation, and another explaining the relation with citations. \n\nI need to structure the response with two statements. The first statement gives the combined length and cites [S65]. The second statement explains the relation, citing the sentences about the passageways, connections to other structures, and the galleria's design as a through-block connection. So sentences [S64], [S72], [S74], [S59], [S60]. \n\nI should check if those sentences are indeed relevant. [S64] mentions the passageway to 1285 Sixth Avenue's lobby, which is part of the lobbies in question. [S72] and [S74] talk about connections to Axa Center and Rockefeller Center. [S59] and [S60] explain the galleria's role in the passageways and as a through-block connection. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the final answer would have two statements: one with the length and [S65], another explaining the connectivity with the other citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific artworks in the galleria and how their descriptions and placements reflect the artistic and functional elements of the space. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences numbered from S58 to S88 and then some more in Passage 2. Let me focus on the parts that mention artworks in the galleria.\n\nLooking at the first passage, S66 mentions Agnes Denes's artwork \"Hypersphere: The Earth in the Shape of the Universe\" with 144 glass panels in the elevator lobby of the First National Bank of Chicago, which is near the galleria. Then S67 talks about LeWitt's set of six geometric artworks called \"Wall Drawing: Bands of Lines in Four Colors and Four Directions, Separated by Gray Bands\" on the galleria's walls. S68 describes these as vertical, horizontal, and diagonal bands in four colors on limestone. S69 says they are up to 106 feet high and lit by natural light from skylights. \n\nS70 mentions Flanagan's two bronze sculptures at the north and south ends: \"Young Elephant\" (1986) and \"Hare on Bell\" (1985). Also, S73 and S74 describe the escalators in a glass enclosure with a gold frame, which might be functional but not artworks. Then S76 and S77 mention Valerie Jaudon's mural for the swimming pool, but that's in the basement concourse, not the galleria itself. \n\nSo the artworks in the galleria are LeWitt's wall drawings, Agnes Denes's artwork (though it's in the elevator lobby nearby), and Flanagan's sculptures. Wait, the question is specifically about the galleria. The Denes artwork is in the elevator lobby east of the galleria, so maybe that's part of the galleria's area? The passage says \"just east of the galleria,\" so maybe it's considered part of the space. The user might consider it as located in the galleria. \n\nThe placements: LeWitt's works are on the walls, using natural light from skylights, which is both artistic (using light as part of the artwork) and functional (illuminating the space). The sculptures at the ends add artistic elements and might guide movement. The escalators' glass enclosure with gold frame is functional but not an artwork. The placement of the artworks in the galleria's walls and ends would enhance the aesthetic while serving the purpose of the space as a passageway. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For LeWitt's artwork: S67, S68, S69. For Flanagan's sculptures: S70, S71. For Agnes Denes: S66. The user might also consider the placement of the artworks in relation to the skylights and the structure of the galleria. The descriptions mention the materials and how they interact with the environment, which ties into both artistic and functional aspects."

Let me scan through the sentences again.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a sentence that says: \"[S84] From the beginning, 787 Seventh Avenue contained several 'smart' building systems, such as high-capacity fiber optic cables and conduits, as well as a computerized display to monitor energy use, security, and elevators.\" Then the next sentence is \"[S85] The 'smart' systems cost $2 to $4 million, though that cost also included a retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue.\" \n\nSo the cost is mentioned here as $2 to $4 million. The additional infrastructure mentioned is the retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue. Also, the smart systems themselves include fiber optic cables, conduits, and a computerized display. \n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the cost and the additional infrastructure included in the expenditure. The retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue is part of the expenditure. The smart systems' cost is $2-4 million. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. Let me check other parts. The rest of the passage talks about the building's structure, atrium, etc., but not about the cost or additional infrastructure beyond the retrofit. \n\nSo the answer should state that the cost was $2 to $4 million, and the additional infrastructure included the retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue. The citations would be [S84] and [S85]. \n\nWait, the question mentions \"Axa Center.\" But in the passage, the building at 787 Seventh Avenue is referred to as Equitable Center West or Equitable Tower, and Axa Center is mentioned in the context of the basement concourse. However, the smart systems are mentioned in the context of 787 Seventh Avenue. But the user is asking about Axa Center. Is there a connection?\n\nLooking back, the passage says: \"The escalators are placed within a glass enclosure containing a gold-colored frame. [S73] The basement concourse is connected to Rockefeller Center's underground concourse... [S74] Axa Center's basement concourse also contains the Athletic & Swim Club...\" So Axa Center is the building with the basement concourse. However, the smart systems are mentioned in the context of 787 Seventh Avenue, which is Equitable Center West. But maybe Axa Center is the same as 787 Seventh Avenue? Or is there a mix-up?\n\nWait, the user might be referring to Axa Center as the building in question. However, in the passage, the smart systems are mentioned in the context of 787 Seventh Avenue, which is Equitable Center West. But the question is about Axa Center. However, in the passage, the basement concourse of Axa Center is connected to other places. But there's no direct mention of Axa Center having the smart systems. However, the passage says: \"The building is internally connected to 1285 Sixth Avenue at the ground floor, concourse, and first eight stories.\" The building here is 787 Seventh Avenue (Equitable Center West). But the user is asking about Axa Center. Maybe there's a confusion here. \n\nWait, the user might have a typo or mix-up. Alternatively, maybe Axa Center is the same as 787 Seventh Avenue. But the passage doesn't explicitly state that. However, given that the question is about Axa Center, and the smart systems are mentioned in the context of 787 Seventh Avenue, which is part of the Equitable Center, perhaps there's an assumption here. Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the same building. Since the passage doesn't explicitly link Axa Center to the smart systems, but the question is about Axa Center, maybe there's an error. However, given the information provided, the only mention of smart systems is in [S84] and [S85], which refer to 787 Seventh Avenue. But the user is asking about Axa Center. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, since the user is asking about Axa Center, and the passage mentions Axa Center's basement concourse, but the smart systems are in 787 Seventh Avenue, perhaps there's a connection. Alternatively, maybe the user is using Axa Center to refer to the Equitable Center. Given that the question is based on the provided passage, and the passage doesn't explicitly state that Axa Center has the smart systems, but the smart systems are part of 787 Seventh Avenue, which is Equitable Center West. However, the user might have intended that. \n\nIn the absence of explicit information, I have to go with what's in the passage. The answer would be based on the sentences that mention the smart systems and their cost, even if the building name is different. But the user might have made a mistake. However, as per the instructions, I have to use the supporting context provided. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the cost was $2 to $4 million, including the retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue. The citations are [S84] and [S85]. Even if the building name is different, the information is there. The user might have intended that Axa Center is the same as 787 Seventh Avenue, or perhaps there's a mix-up. But based on the given text, that's the only relevant information."

    "[S1] Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n# Axa Equitable Center\n\n\n\n**Axa Equitable Center** (originally the **Equitable Tower** or **Equitable Center West**) is an office skyscraper at 787 Seventh Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S2] Completed in 1986 and designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the building measures 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S3] Equitable Center West was developed by the Equitable Life Assurance Society (later renamed Equitable Holdings, part of Axa) adjacent to Equitable's existing skyscraper at 1285 Avenue of the Americas. [S4] The facade is clad in granite, applied in a two-tone pattern of white horizontal and red vertical bands. [S5] The building has three setbacks, as well as a penthouse at the top with arched windows. [S6] Equitable acquired an extensive collection of artwork to display in the building's public spaces. [S7] There is a public galleria from 51st to 52nd Street, which forms part of 6\u00bd Avenue, as well as an arched entrance atrium from Seventh Avenue. [S8] The complex also includes an underground concourse, several restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. [S9] The building was proposed in the early 1980s and, after the site was acquired, Equitable's board approved the plans for the tower in 1983. [S10] When the tower opened, the company's corporate offices occupied about a third of the space, and the ground story had commercial concerns such as the Le Bernardin restaurant and a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S11] Equitable only used the tower as its headquarters until the late 1990s, and the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) acquired Axa Equitable Center in 2016. [S12] ## Site\n\n787 Seventh (formerly known as the AXA Equitable Building) is at 787 Seventh Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S13] The building's rectangular land lot occupies the western half of the city block bounded by Seventh Avenue to the west, 51st Street to the south, Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) to the east, and 52nd Street to the north. [S14] The site covers 80,333 square feet (7,463.2\u00a0m\u00b2), with a frontage of 200 feet (61\u00a0m) on Seventh Avenue and 400 feet (120\u00a0m) along the side streets. [S15] Adjacent is 1285 Avenue of the Americas (1285 Sixth Avenue; Equitable Center East), designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and constructed from 1959 to 1961. [S16] The Sixth Avenue building occupies the eastern half of the city block. [S17] The sidewalk in front of the building is made of pink granite, extending eastward in front of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S18] The sidewalks adjacent to 1285 Sixth Avenue comprise Urban Plaza North and South, designed by Scott Burton. [S19] Axa Equitable Center is also near 810 Seventh Avenue to the northwest, the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel and Flatotel New York City to the north, Credit Lyonnais Building to the northeast, 1271 Avenue of the Americas to the southeast, The Michelangelo to the south, and the Winter Garden Theatre to the southwest. [S20] The site occupied by Axa Equitable Center had contained the Victoria and Abbey hotels just before the skyscraper's construction. [S21] ## Architecture\n\nAxa Equitable Center was designed in the postmodern style by Edward Larrabee Barnes for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. [S22] The building is 752 feet (229\u00a0m) tall with 54 stories. [S23] Severud Associates was the structural engineer and Turner Construction was the main contractor. [S24] The structure uses 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of stone and 28,000 short tons (25,000 long tons; 25,000\u00a0t) of steel. [S25] Rather than dictate the precise style for the building, Equitable CEO John B. [S26] Carter had requested only that Barnes create \"a top-quality building\". [S27] Nonetheless, Carter had specific requests for several of the interior spaces.",
    "[S28] For Equitable Tower's construction, Equitable acquired $7 million or $7.5 million worth of artwork to display in both public and private spaces. [S29] The work includes large murals by Sol LeWitt and Roy Lichtenstein and sculptures by Scott Burton and Barry Flanagan. [S30] In addition, works by Milton Avery, George Bellows, James E. [S31] Buttersworth, Marsden Hartley, and Alex Katz decorated the offices. [S32] Some works, such as a mobile by Alexander Calder and the bronze sculpture *Day* by Paul Manship, were already in Equitable's art collection when Equitable Tower was built. [S33] Equitable hired several experts, including art consultant Emily Braun, to assist in arranging the artwork. [S34] Equitable publications referred to 787 Seventh Avenue, along with 1285 Sixth Avenue, as \"one square block of art\". [S35] ### Form and facade\n\nThe entire building is set back 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) from the street on each side. [S36] A public galleria runs from north to south, dividing the lowest six floors of the building. [S37] The seventh and eighth stories span the north and south ends of the galleria. [S38] The north and south elevations rise with three setbacks, while the west and east elevations rise without setbacks. [S39] The setbacks on the north and south elevations are placed at the 12th, 34th, and 50th stories, with each setback being 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) deep. [S40] Barnes intended for the setbacks to recall those on 30 Rockefeller Plaza and the International Building, two of Rockefeller Center's tallest buildings. [S41] One of the early plans for Axa Equitable Center, which was illustrated in a monograph of Barnes's work, was for the massing to instead contain setbacks on the west and east, with the north and south elevations rising as a slab-like wall from the street. [S42] In a subsequent iteration of the plans, Barnes had planned deep porches at the setbacks. [S43] The facade is made of limestone, granite, and glass. [S44] The Indiana limestone and Brazilian granite on the facade is applied in a two-tone pattern. [S45] The vertical pilasters are clad with reddish-brown granite, which is also used for some horizontal bands just below each setback. [S46] The pilasters divide the facades into horizontal spandrel bands of buff-colored limestone, which alternate with glass windows on each floor. [S47] Barnes had used these materials because they harmonized with the colors and materials used on the neighboring buildings. [S48] Axa Equitable Center uses 5,800 panes of glass on its facade. [S49] The main entrance on Seventh Avenue is set within a semicircular-headed arch measuring 72 feet (22\u00a0m) tall. [S50] There is a loading dock at the eastern end of the 52nd Street elevation. [S51] There are double-height mechanical spaces at each setback. [S52] These double-height floors contain recessed windows to give the impression that the red pilasters are massive piers; the recessed windows were inspired by those in Art Deco buildings. [S53] The recessed windows on the double-height floors also wrap around to the west and east elevations. [S54] The topmost penthouse is embellished with large triumphal-arched windows on its west and east elevations, which illuminate the Equitable boardrooms. [S55] The boardroom windows measure 42 feet (13\u00a0m) in diameter and 53 feet (16\u00a0m) tall. [S56] While the original plan had been to use ocular windows, Barnes instead used triumphal arches because they allowed more light to enter the boardroom spaces. [S57] ### Galleria and concourse",
    "[S58] At the middle of the city block is the galleria from 51st to 52nd Street. [S59] It is one of six passageways that form 6\u00bd Avenue, a set of full-block passageways from 51st to 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. [S60] The passageway was built as a \"through-block connection\" under the Special Midtown District, created in 1982. [S61] The space measures 45 feet (14\u00a0m) wide and 91 feet (28\u00a0m) tall underneath the north and south ends, where the seventh and eighth floors cross the galleria. [S62] The center of the space, beneath the skylights, is 124 feet (38\u00a0m) tall. [S63] Burton designed outdoor seating for the galleria. [S64] On the galleria's eastern wall is a passageway to 1285 Sixth Avenue's lobby, which originally connected with the Paine Webber Art Gallery in that building. [S65] The lobbies of 1285 Sixth Avenue and Equitable Center measured a combined 800 feet (240\u00a0m) long. [S66] An elevator lobby for the First National Bank of Chicago, just east of the galleria, contained Agnes Denes's artwork *Hypersphere: The Earth in the Shape of the Universe*, a set of 144 glass panels. [S67] LeWitt commissioned a set of six geometric artworks for the walls of the galleria entitled *Wall Drawing: Bands of Lines in Four Colors and Four Directions, Separated by Gray Bands*. [S68] As the name indicates, LeWitt's artwork consists of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal bands in four colors, created in acrylic paint on limestone. [S69] These works, which are up to 106 feet (32\u00a0m) high, are illuminated by natural light coming through the rooftop skylights. [S70] In addition, Flanagan designed two bronze sculptures at the galleria's north and south ends, each depicting animals in whimsical scenes. [S71] The north end contains *Young Elephant* (1986), while the south end contains *Hare on Bell* (1985). [S72] Two escalators lead from the galleria to Axa Center's public basement concourse. [S73] The escalators are placed within a glass enclosure containing a gold-colored frame. [S74] The basement concourse is connected to Rockefeller Center's underground concourse, which in turn provides a connection to the New York City Subway's 47th\u201350th Streets\u2013Rockefeller Center station. [S75] Axa Center's basement concourse also contains the Athletic & Swim Club, which has a fitness center and a small swimming pool. [S76] Valerie Jaudon had created a mural for the swimming pool's wall, measuring 72 by 12 feet (21.9 by 3.7\u00a0m). [S77] ### Interior\n\nAxa Center contains 1,740,000 square feet (162,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of interior space. [S78] According to the New York City Department of City Planning, the building has a gross floor area of 1,633,544 square feet (151,761.2\u00a0m\u00b2). [S79] Equitable was allowed to include an additional 49,161 square feet (4,567.2\u00a0m\u00b2) in exchange for providing privately owned public space. [S80] The steel superstructure contains two-story outrigger trusses wrapping around the 11th and 36th stories, which transfer the structural loads and absorb the wind loads at each of the setbacks. [S81] Belt trusses connect the outrigger trusses to the building's structural core. [S82] The roof is surrounded by a hat truss, behind which is mechanical equipment. [S83] From the beginning, 787 Seventh Avenue contained several \"smart\" building systems, such as high-capacity fiber optic cables and conduits, as well as a computerized display to monitor energy use, security, and elevators. [S84] The \"smart\" systems cost $2 to $4 million, though that cost also included a retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S85] The building is internally connected to 1285 Sixth Avenue at the ground floor, concourse, and first eight stories. [S86] The 787 Seventh Avenue building was known as Equitable Center West or Equitable Tower, while the 1285 Sixth Avenue building was known as Equitable Center East. [S87] The two structures were initially known collectively as the \"Equitable Center\". [S88] #### Atrium and lobby",
    "[S89] Leading from Seventh Avenue is a five-story atrium, which serves as the main lobby. [S90] The atrium is an 80-foot (24\u00a0m) cube. [S91] Its large size is in part due to a commercial holdout who did not leave the site until construction had already started. [S92] At the center of the atrium, Burton designed *Atrium Furnishment*, which consists of a 40-foot-wide (12\u00a0m) marble semicircular banquette and a circular marble fountain with trees. [S93] Though the atrium in general has a white marble floor, *Atrium Furnishment* is surrounded by red granite pavers, which were intended to provide a contrast between the circular artwork and the cubical atrium. [S94] A bronze band surrounds the artwork as well. [S95] On the eastern wall of the atrium, facing the main archway on Seventh Avenue, is a Lichtenstein artwork, *Mural with Blue Brushstroke*, which measures 68 by 32 feet (20.7 by 9.8\u00a0m). [S96] Lichtenstein had painted the mural on-site in 1986. [S97] A pair of parallel passageways leads east from the atrium to the galleria, each originally decorated with a separate artwork. [S98] Thomas Hart Benton's *America Today* murals, commissioned in 1931, were originally installed in the northern passageway, around the elevator core. [S99] The Benton murals were originally installed in the New School for Social Research, and Equitable had acquired the Benton murals in 1984 for a reported $3.1 million. [S100] The murals were relocated to 1290 Sixth Avenue in the mid-1990s. [S101] The southern passageway of the lobby has a niche, which contains Paul Manship's sculpture *Day*. [S102] Manship had crafted *Day* in 1938 as part of a set of four bronze works called *The Moods of Time*. [S103] #### Retail and restaurants\n\nA branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art occupied space in two storefront galleries from 1986 to 1992. [S104] There was a north gallery for permanent works and a south gallery for temporary exhibitions. [S105] The Equitable Tower location, the largest of the Whitney's four branches at the time, occupied 3,000 square feet (280\u00a0m\u00b2) in each gallery. [S106] As part of the arrangement, Equitable gave money to the Whitney and paid the branch's operating expenses for six years. [S107] After the Whitney branch closed, its space became the Equitable Gallery. [S108] Another tenant was the Cathedral of St. [S109] John the Divine, which operated two stores with souvenirs from the city's museums. [S110] The Urbanspace food hall has also operated at ground level since 2020. [S111] From the building's opening in early 1986, Equitable officials wanted to operate what *Newsday* described as \"nothing but the best of restaurants\". [S112] Initially, there was an Italian restaurant called Palio and a French restaurant called Le Bernardin. [S113] Palio's ground-floor bar measured 30 by 30 feet (9.1 by 9.1\u00a0m), with a 24-foot-tall (7.3\u00a0m) ceiling, and its second floor contained a dining room. [S114] The former bar room's walls still contain a mural by Sandro Chia entitled *Palio*, which depicts the Palio di Siena horse race. [S115] Le Bernardin, a Michelin-starred restaurant, occupies a less architecturally elaborate space, originally decorated with velvet upholstery. [S116] A third restaurant, the American grill Sam's Restaurant, opened in late 1987. [S117] While Le Bernardin continued to operate in the building in the 2010s, the old Palio space has operated as the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar since 2014. [S118] Meanwhile, Sam's was replaced by Judson Grill and then Bar Americain. [S119] #### Other stories\n\nThe building has 31 passenger elevators, as well as three freight elevators and two vehicular elevators. [S120] Twenty-six of the passenger elevators lead from the lobby to the upper floors. [S121] Four of these elevators run from the lobby to floors 2 through 9; eight elevators serve floors 9 through 23; six elevators serve floors 23 through 33; and eight elevators serve floors 34 through 50. [S122] There are also two elevators in the annex, serving the lobby through floor 8; another elevator connecting the lobby to the subcellar; and two elevators connecting the Axa Equitable auditorium to the lobby.",
    "[S123] A broadcast studio and auditorium were also designed for the building. [S124] The Equitable auditorium has 487, 495, or 500 seats, accessed from a staircase from the atrium. [S125] The auditorium has been used for several major corporate events, including the announcement of a merger between IBM and Lotus Software, as well as the merger announcement of Kimberly-Clark and Scott Paper Company. [S126] It has also been used for musical performances, such as a jazz performance by Roy Nathanson in 1990. [S127] Equitable officials had their own private bathrooms as well as Chippendale furniture. [S128] The 49th and 50th floors comprised Equitable's executive suite and were connected by a stair. [S129] The 49th floor was designed with 14 dining rooms, each with works from a different artists. [S130] The dining rooms range from a small accommodation, with one table and four chairs, to a dining hall with a baby grand piano, sofas, and a fireplace. [S131] There were two executive rooms at the 50th story: one facing east and the other facing west. [S132] The rooms had classical-inspired moldings, large woodwork, and custom furnishings designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Conway. [S133] The western room, which served as Equitable's main boardroom, was originally designed with a green carpet with a large circular table. [S134] The eastern room had Equitable's main dining room and contained *Triptych*, a trio of landscapes by Brad Davis. [S135] ## History\n\nEquitable Holdings (originally the Equitable Life Assurance Society) had constructed several structures in New York City since the late 19th century, as well as several across the United States. [S136] The first New York City office was the Equitable Life Building on 120 Broadway in Lower Manhattan, completed in 1870. [S137] The Equitable Life Building was destroyed by a fire in 1912 and replaced by the current Equitable Building at 120 Broadway. [S138] Equitable Life moved to 393 Seventh Avenue (now 11 Penn Plaza) in 1924, and it moved to 1281 Sixth Avenue in 1961. [S139] Equitable had occupied all 1.8\u00a0million square feet (170,000\u00a0m\u00b2) in its Sixth Avenue building for over twenty years. [S140] However, by the 1980s, it was looking to move decentralize its New York City office. [S141] The company split into four major divisions, of which only one, Equitable Capital, remained in the Sixth Avenue building. [S142] At the time, office space in Midtown Manhattan was in high demand and Equitable felt it could lease its Sixth Avenue building at a great profit. [S143] ### Development\n\nAfter considering relocating elsewhere in the United States, Equitable planned to expand its Sixth Avenue headquarters by 1980. [S144] Over the next year, it acquired an adjacent L-shaped site extending to Seventh Avenue, measuring 67,000 square feet (6,200\u00a0m\u00b2). [S145] Except for a small plot on the corner of Seventh Avenue and 52nd Street, Equitable had control of the entire city block. [S146] Equitable first announced its intention, in March 1981, to construct a tower on the newly acquired Seventh Avenue site. [S147] Demolition of existing buildings, such as the Victoria and Abbey hotels, began soon after. [S148] General contractor Turner Construction performed the demolitions manually, even though it had the city government's permission to use dynamite, since it wished to minimize disruption to neighboring structures. [S149] During one demolition in 1982, a steel beam fell through the roof of a nearby deli.",
    "[S150] Equitable's board officially approved plans in February 1983 to move its headquarters to a Seventh Avenue building. [S151] Edward Larrabee Barnes was hired as the architect. [S152] Equitable's new tower was one of several high-rise developments planned for the area at the time, in spite of a slight decline in New York City's office market. [S153] Equitable planned to sell its Sixth Avenue headquarters to get a tax deduction on the new building. [S154] The old Sixth Avenue structure would be partially occupied by Paine Webber. [S155] Equitable officials were not worried about the fact that Seventh Avenue was not a prestigious executive address. [S156] This was a contrast to two decades earlier, when officials had thought Sixth Avenue was \"more like Speakeasy Row than Corporate Corridor\". [S157] While much of the building was to be completed by 1985, the section at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 52nd Street was occupied by an eight-story building and would be delayed. [S158] Construction of Equitable Tower had to be closely coordinated to avoid delays or disruptions, since even a one-month delay in completion would cost Equitable $6 million in rent and $3 million in construction loans. [S159] Work was complicated by the fact that traffic on the neighboring streets could not be disrupted during construction. [S160] On two sides of the construction site, there was only 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7\u00a0m) of space within which builders could work, and there was no space for materials to be stored on site. [S161] Equitable president John B. [S162] Carter announced in May 1985 that a series of artworks would be commissioned for the building. [S163] During construction that July, a construction hoist fell from Equitable Tower and killed two workers. [S164] ### Opening and early years\n\nBy early 1986, Equitable had finished the atrium, galleria, plazas, and lobby, as well as a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S165] The company had taken the top third of the building and expected to rent out the remaining stories at a rate of $40 to $50 per square foot ($430 to $540/m\u00b2), a higher rate than at nearby office buildings. [S166] At the time, there were few tenants for the west tower's vacant space, and Equitable was marketing both the west and east towers as part of the same complex. [S167] The building ultimately cost $200 million to construct. [S168] A public preview of the new tower's boardrooms took place on February 1, 1986, as part of a benefit event for the Center for Arts Information. [S169] The Whitney branch opened on February 11, 1986. [S170] Douglas McGill of *The New York Times* called the Whitney branch the \"latest and largest addition to an extensive collaboration between a major art museum and the corporate world.\"\n\nThe building was technically owned by Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, which leased space to Equitable for its own corporate offices. [S171] Within a year of Equitable Tower's opening, eighty percent of the space had been leased. [S172] Among the tenants were arts organizations American Council for the Arts, Center for Arts Information, and Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, which were offered below-market-rate rents. [S173] In addition, accounting firm Ernst & Whinney (later Ernst & Young) took space in the tower. [S174] By October 1987, when Black Monday occurred, Equitable Tower was fully leased despite charging higher rents per square foot than other buildings in the area. [S175] The American grill Sam's Restaurant opened at ground level at the end of that year. [S176] ### 1990s and 2000s",
    "[S177] By 1990, Equitable was in the process of being acquired by the French company Axa. [S178] Within two years, Equitable had gone public and downsized most of its employees, leaving only 2,200 working at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S179] The company was considering leaving for the suburbs, given the high costs of occupying office space in midtown, but ultimately decided against it. [S180] The Whitney branch in Equitable Tower closed in 1992, when its original agreement expired, and it was replaced by an art gallery called the Equitable Gallery. [S181] Sam's Restaurant closed the next year, being replaced by another American grill, Judson Grill, in early 1994. [S182] Equitable only occupied ten percent of 787 Seventh Avenue by early 1995, when it placed 300,000 square feet (28,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of space for lease. [S183] That year, Equitable announced it would be moving one block east to 1290 Sixth Avenue, with only the highest-ranking executives remaining at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S184] Much of Equitable's space at 787 Seventh Avenue was taken by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the floor just below the penthouse was occupied by Paramount Capital. [S185] With Equitable's relocation, the *America Today* murals were moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue. [S186] In the late 1990s, David Emil planned to open a restaurant called Night Sky on the 50th floor, but it was canceled after Equitable wished to lease that floor as offices. [S187] The 1997 chess match of Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov, in which IBM supercomputer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov, took place at Equitable Center as well. [S188] By 2000, the building's tenants included Bank One, BNP Paribas, Hicks Muse, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher. [S189] About a third of the total space, 500,000 square feet (46,000\u00a0m\u00b2), was set to become available for lease in 2002 when Ernst & Young's lease expired. [S190] Much of Ernst & Young's space was taken in 2001 by law firm Sidley Austin, which had to renovate 11 floors within two months after its old World Trade Center offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. [S191] Another lessee that had been displaced from the World Trade Center was investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which borrowed space from BNP Paribas and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz before leasing its own fourth-floor space. [S192] The Palio restaurant closed in 2002, and Judson Grill closed two years later; the latter was replaced by Bar Americain. [S193] Citigroup leased a major block of space, covering 250,000 square feet (23,000\u00a0m\u00b2), in late 2005, including the 50th-floor penthouse. [S194] Other tenants in the 2000s included investment manager New Mountain Capital as well as IT company SAS Institute. [S195] ### 2010s to present\n\nPalio's space became part of Piano Due, which closed in 2011 and was replaced by the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar in 2014. [S196] Axa Equitable placed 787 Seventh Avenue and 1285 Sixth Avenue for sale in August 2015. [S197] At the time, 787 Seventh Avenue was almost completely occupied, with only 1.6 percent of the space vacant. [S198] By the end of the year, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS) had shown interest in acquiring 787 Seventh Avenue for $1.9 billion. [S199] This would make Axa Equitable Center one of the most expensive single buildings to ever be sold in New York City. [S200] In February 2016, CalPERS announced it had purchased the building. [S201] The purchase was financed with a $780 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank.",
    "[S202] Bar Americain, at the building's ground floor, closed in 2018. [S203] A helicopter crashed on Axa Equitable Center's roof on June 10, 2019, killing the pilot and sparking a fire that prompted the building's evacuation. [S204] No one else was hurt in the crash, and the helicopter's wreckage was removed. [S205] The Urbanspace food hall opened at the ground level of Axa Equitable Center in early 2020. [S206] In 2022, following the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, BNP Paribas renovated its offices at 787 Seventh Avenue to encourage workers to return to the firm's physical offices. [S207] In addition, a sign with the name \"BNP Paribas\" was installed above the Seventh Avenue entrance, replacing Equitable's name. [S208] Although 787 Seventh Avenue had an occupancy rate of 96 percent by early 2024, its value had declined by $123 million since the pandemic; at the time, the building was estimated to be worth $917 million. [S209] The reduced valuation reflected the fact that BNP Paribas had downsized its space at the building from 450,000 to 300,000 square feet (42,000 to 28,000\u00a0m\u00b2), while the lease of another major tenant, UBS, was scheduled to expire in 2026. [S210] ## Tenants\n\nAs of 2024\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49, several financial and law firms occupy the space, including:\n\n* BNP Paribas, banking group\n* Citigroup, investment bank\n* Sidley Austin, law firm\n* Stifel, investment bank\n* UBS, investment bank\n* Willkie Farr & Gallagher, law firm\n\n## Impact\n\n\n### Reception\n\nThe design of Equitable Tower was largely criticized upon its completion. [S211] Paul Goldberger called the building \"54 stories of ambivalence\", saying it \"adds almost no grace to the skyline\". [S212] *Progressive Architecture* was similarly critical of the \"undistinguished quality\" of the facade, saying: \"Barnes's tower can't seem to make up its mind whether it's a Modern skyscraper or a Post-Modern one\", Roger Kimball of *The New Criterion* wrote: \"Mr. [S213] Barnes seems to have abandoned any attempt at a cogent architectural design. [S214] Instead, he has contrived to produce one of the most pretentious and ungainly new buildings in New York.\" *The New Criterion* cited Equitable Tower's \"large clunky base\", its \"replaceable\"-looking granite and limestone facade, and its massive arches that \"seem more like movie-set novelties\" as flaws in the design. [S215] Suzanne Stephens said the criticism showed that Barnes was \"more adept at chipping, chamfering and chiseling buildings with rotated geometries\". [S216] By contrast, architectural writer Donald M. [S217] Reynolds said the building was \"one of the largest and most comprehensive collaborations of architecture, urban planning, and public art since Rockefeller Center\". [S218] The artwork was received more positively by architectural and art critics. [S219] *The New York Times* reported that the artwork was a \"statement of [Equitable's] belief not only in the commercial and promotional value of art, but also in the role art can play in the quality of corporate and communal life\". [S220] *Progressive Architecture* characterized the collection as \"one of the more successful corporate art programs to come along in some time\", as opposed to the \"resolutely ho-hum\" character of much of Equitable Tower. [S221] Phaidon Press wrote of the art collection: \"AXA Equitable Life Insurance wished to project a positive image of itself to New Yorkers\u2014as progressive, leading edge and civic-minded, as demonstrated by this indisputable gift to the city.\" Conversely, *The New Criterion* wrote that the collection was \"not art but money\", in that it was a showcase of Equitable's wealth rather than a display of art for its own sake. [S222] Goldberger thought that, even with the art and public spaces, the building \"lacks a kind of freshness, as if everyone involved in this project were doing it by rote\". [S223] ### Influence on other developments",
    "[S224] Equitable was the first major company to erect a headquarters on Seventh Avenue in Midtown. [S225] At the time of its completion, the building was the only major office structure on Seventh Avenue. [S226] This led *Architectural Record* to say: \"Equitable Life Assurance Society has heeded Horace Greeley's dictum, 'Go West', though not, to be sure, very far west.\" According to Reynolds, the building's construction encouraged office development to move west from Sixth to Seventh Avenue, just as the construction of Rockefeller Center had encouraged a similar westward movement from Fifth to Sixth Avenue. [S227] *Architectural Record* described the building as having been proposed \"amidst a swirl of controversy over what some see as an over-concentration of new skyscraper construction in Manhattan's crowded midtown\". [S228] Nonetheless, the development of Equitable Tower directly improved the character of the surrounding area, particularly the Midtown portion of Seventh Avenue, in the mid-1980s. [S229] Following the tower's construction, William Zeckendorf developed the nearby One Worldwide Plaza to improve the character of Eighth Avenue. [S230] Though developers praised the development boom that followed Equitable Tower's construction, civic organizations worried that theaters north of Times Square would be quickly replaced by offices."
