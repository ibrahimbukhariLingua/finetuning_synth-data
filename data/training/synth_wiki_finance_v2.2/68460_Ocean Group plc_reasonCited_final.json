      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the 1967 restructuring in the company's organizational structure and which fleet operating companies were established then.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The relevant part is under \"Group members\" where it mentions the 1967 restructuring. The sentence says that in 1967, the fleet operations were divided among four companies. The four companies listed are Blue Funnel Line, Elder Dempster, Glen Line, and Nederlandsche Stoomvaart Maatschappij Oceaan. \n\nThe question has two parts: the role of the restructuring and the names of the companies. The passage states that the restructuring divided the fleet operations into four companies, each answering to the main board. So the role was reorganizing the fleet operations into separate entities under the main board. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The sentence about the 1967 restructuring is [S13]. The list of companies is part of that same sentence, so they should be cited with [S13]. \n\nWait, the user might think if the companies were established during the restructuring. The passage says \"divided amongst four companies,\" which implies they were existing entities. But the question says \"established during this period.\" Maybe the companies were established around that time, but the passage doesn't explicitly say they were created in 1967. However, the restructuring involved dividing operations into these four, so perhaps they were the ones established then. The answer should stick to the text. \n\nSo the answer would state that the 1967 restructuring divided fleet operations into four companies, each under the main board. The companies are listed as Blue Funnel Line, Elder Dempster, Glen Line, and Nederlandsche Stoomvaart Maatschappij Oceaan, all cited from [S13]. \n\nI need to format each sentence properly with <statement> and <cite>. Since the information is in one sentence, maybe split into two statements? Wait, the user's example had two sentences. But the answer might be one sentence. Let me check the passage again. The sentence starts with \"A major restructuring exercise occurred in 1967...\" and lists the four companies. So the role is the restructuring dividing operations, and the companies are listed. So the first statement would be about the role, citing [S13], and the second statement listing the companies, also citing [S13]. \n\nBut the user's example had two sentences with different citations. Here, both parts are from the same sentence. So both statements would have [S13]. Let me structure it that way."
