[S2] These coins were minted entirely within the city of Montevideo, first at the \"*Taller y Armer\u00eda Jouve*\" owned by a French artisan named Agust\u00edn Jouve and later at the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* (Montevideo Mint) or *Casa de Moneda Nacional*, which was created for this purpose. [S3] This period in Uruguayan numismatics was immersed in a historical context full of economic problems, a non-existent currency, an economy practically in chaos and a civil war that lasted for years (the Great War). [S4] In spite of these difficulties, several attempts were made to mint a coin that would bear national signs and would be able to put an end to the prevailing chaos, given that up to that moment the currency of all the different regimes that had exercised power in the territory had been in circulation: the Crown of Spain, the Crown of Portugal, the British Empire, the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata and, finally, the Empire of Brazil. [S5] The first national coins were minted in 1839, in the workshop of the engraver Agust\u00edn Jouve, followed by the series minted in the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* until 1855, date from which the first coins were minted in foreign mints, thus culminating the classic period of Uruguayan numismatics.

[S12] With the arrival of the first Constitutional President of the Republic, General Fructuoso Rivera, important measures continued to be taken, ordering in 1831 the withdrawal of all foreign copper currency. [S13] As a result of these measures, the city suffered a serious lack of foreign currency, so the government began to look for a quick solution to supply the needs of commerce.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the economic and political instability in Uruguay during the 1830s-1850s affected the feasibility of a stable monetary system and the consequences of those challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and identify relevant sentences. The passage mentions that during this period, there were economic problems, a non-existent currency, an economy in chaos, and a civil war (the Great War). These factors are listed in S3. That directly answers the first part about the impact of instability.\n\nThen, the passage talks about attempts to mint national coins despite the difficulties, as mentioned in S4. However, the economic difficulties and social situation made it almost impossible to establish a stable monetary policy, according to S8. This shows the challenges in creating a stable system.\n\nThe consequences include the circulation of multiple foreign currencies until 1893 (S11), and the government's quick solutions like the \"Tenths of the city of Buenos Aires\" (S14). The lack of foreign currency led to the issuance of these coins, which were only worth half their written value. This indicates the consequences of the challenges, like the temporary measures taken and the continued reliance on foreign currencies.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. For example, the economic problems and chaos are in S3 and S8. The attempts to mint coins are in S4. The consequences like foreign currencies and the Tenths are in S11 and S14. Also, the civil war is mentioned in S3. \n\nI should structure the answer with each relevant sentence, citing the appropriate numbers. Need to check if all the key points are covered: instability's impact, feasibility issues, and the consequences like multiple currencies and temporary solutions."

      "question": "What were the primary legal and material challenges faced by the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* during its first period of operations, and how did these challenges influence the characteristics of the coins minted?",
      "answer": "<statement>The *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* faced legal challenges related to compliance with Laws No. 254 and No. 255 of December 13, 1843, which authorized the issuance of specific coin denominations, including copper and silver coins. These laws mandated the production of 5, 20, and 40 cent\u00e9simos of real (copper) and Half and One *Peso Fuerte* (silver), shaping the initial coinage framework.<cite>[S37][S38][S39]</cite></statement><statement>Material challenges arose from the Siege of Montevideo, which caused severe scarcity of silver.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S37] It was created in order to comply with Laws No. [S38] 254 and No. [S39] 255 of December 13, 1843, which empowered the Government to issue coins of 5, 20 and 40 hundredths of real (copper) and Half and One *Peso Fuerte* (silver). [S40] The same day these laws were enacted, the first tests were carried out, minting coins of 20 hundredths of a real. [S41] In spite of this, the institution was officially inaugurated on February 2, 1844, by the then Political and Police Chief of Montevideo, Andr\u00e9s Lamas, installing itself in a small workshop in the building of the Police Headquarters of the city called *Casa Central de Polic\u00eda*. [S42] ### First period of issues by the Casa de Monedas\n\nThere are two distinct stages in the first period of the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, which are detailed below. [S43] ### First stage\n\nThis stage began with the minting of a 20 cent\u00e9simos coin on the afternoon of December 13 and lasted until mid-March 1844, when the Mint suspended its activities. [S44] During this period the institution depended on the Political Chief of the city of Montevideo and its director was Don Domingo Parpal and minted coins of 20 cent\u00e9simos of 1843, 5, 20 and 40 cent\u00e9simos of 1844 in addition to the magnificent piece of the *Peso Fuerte* or *Peso del Sitio*. [S45] All these pieces were made in the workshop located in the *\"Casa Central de Polic\u00eda\"*. [S46] #### First issue (20 cent 1843)\n\nImmediately after the promulgation of Law No. [S47] 254 of December 13, 1843, the first trials were carried out by issuing 20 cent coins with the same stamps used by Agust\u00edn Jouve in 1839, with the date changed from 1840 to 1843. [S48] The characteristic of these pieces is that since the date was modified, the number 3 appears forced. [S49] These pieces are the first issued by the *Casa de Moneda Nacional*.

[S61] coin was the only one minted at the Mint with this value. [S62] For its minting, a number of stamps were used that have not yet been accurately determined, so that more than 20 variants of this piece are known. [S63] One of these variants is known as the \"*Sol de Cabellera*\", since on the obverse the face of the sun corresponds to a native with long hair. [S64] Due to its great relief, it is very rare to find specimens in good condition, which makes it a very coveted piece by collectors. [S65] #### *Peso del Sitio* or *Peso Fuerte*\n\nPassage 2:\n[S66] This piece is the only silver coin to be minted at the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*. [S67] This minting was carried out in an extremely reduced number (a little more than 1,000) due to the scarcity of materials. [S68] This shortage of materials (caused by the Siege of Montevideo) could be overcome because materials were collected inside the besieged square. [S69] *Mates*, spoons, light bulbs, spurs, etc., all made of silver, were collected from the citizens, among them Andr\u00e9s Lamas himself or personalities such as Giuseppe Garibaldi or Isidoro de Mar\u00eda.\u1d56\u1d43\u1d4d\u1d49\u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 The collected silver, naturally impure, product of the different qualities of silver collected, was analyzed by the expert chemist Professor Julio Antonio Lenoble, who classified the material with a fine 10 1/2 dineros (0.875). [S70] #### Characteristics of the *Peso del Sitio*\n\n| ***Peso del Sitio* o *Peso Fuerte*** | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Value | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 1 peso.

[S73] * This piece would circulate only in Montevideo since on February 15, 1844, from his headquarters in the Cerrito de la Victoria, General Manuel Oribe (Chief of the forces that besieged Montevideo) prohibits the circulation throughout the territory of the Republic. [S74] It is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful coins of the Classical Monetary. [S75] It was minted with similar characteristics to those of a Spanish peso. [S76] It is believed that it was minted more as a commemorative element than for circulation. [S77] This idea is based on the good condition in which the specimens have arrived to our time (although some specimens undoubtedly circulated). [S78] The following is a small passage from a speech made by Andr\u00e9s Lamas to the President of the Republic, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, on the occasion of the inauguration of the *Casa de Moneda Nacional*. [S79] > YOUR EXCELLENCY. [S80] Sir: I have the honor to present to Your Excellency the first silver coin destined for circulation, minted at the *Casa de Moneda Nacional*. [S81] This coin, Mr. [S82] President, is monumental, and this monument is unique to this day on the eastern and western banks of the Rio de la Plata. [S83] This coin is the most finished symbol, Mr. [S84] President, of the National Independence. [S85] In all times and in the public law of all nations, the minting of coins has been the highest prerogative of the Independent Empire. [S86] ### Second stage\n\nThe *Casa de Moneda Nacional*, once out of operation, continued to depend on the Political Chief of the city of Montevideo, until May 27, 1844, when it became dependent on the Ministry of Finance (a position held by Andres Lamas). [S87] On September 20, 1844, Andr\u00e9s Lamas resigned from the Ministry of Finance due to a series of denunciations he received for irregularities committed in the *Casa de Monedas*. [S88] At the head of this ministry would now be Don Santiago Sayago who would order on October 20 the opening of the mint designating Don Juan de Bernade y Mederos as General Director. [S89] The existing stamps were immediately inspected and found to be in very poor condition, so the Director obtained authorization to have new ones engraved. [S90] During this period only 40 cent coins were issued with a date of 1844 (as was seen previously in issue 40 cent of 1844). [S91] This stage of the *Casa de Monedas* lasted until mid-January 1845, when it was definitively closed and the materials of Agust\u00edn Jouve used up to that time were returned.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary legal and material challenges faced by the Casa de Moneda de Montevideo during its first period of operations and how these challenges influenced the characteristics of the coins minted.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the Casa de Moneda was created under Laws No. 254 and 255 of December 13, 1843. These laws allowed the government to issue specific coins. However, the first tests were carried out the same day, but the institution was officially inaugurated later in February 1844. \n\nLooking at the first stage, they started minting 20 cent\u00e9simos coins in December 1843. But there's a mention of the institution depending on the Political Chief of Montevideo and the director being Domingo Parpal. The first coins had issues with the date modification, leading to a forced '3' in the number. That might be a material challenge, like using existing stamps but altering them, which could affect the coin's quality.\n\nThen there's the issue of the Peso Fuerte or Peso del Sitio. The passage states that the minting of this silver coin was limited due to material scarcity, specifically because of the Siege of Montevideo. They had to collect silver items from citizens, which were impure. This scarcity would influence the coin's characteristics, like the metal purity (10 1/2 dineros, 0.875 fine) and the fact that only around 1,000 were made. Also, the Peso del Sitio was mostly commemorative, not for circulation, which might be a legal challenge because of the restrictions on its use.\n\nAnother point is the material challenges affecting the 40 cent\u00e9simos coin. The passage mentions that more than 20 variants exist due to unknown stamps used, leading to different designs like the \"Sol de Cabellera.\" This variability could be due to the limited and possibly inconsistent materials available.\n\nThe legal challenges might include the laws that mandated specific coinage, but the material shortages forced adaptations. For example, the Peso del Sitio's limited circulation due to the siege and the legal prohibition by General Oribe. Also, the transition in management from the Political Chief to the Ministry of Finance might have caused operational challenges.\n\nSo, compiling this, the primary legal challenges were the laws that required specific coinage, and the material challenges were the scarcity of silver during the siege, leading to impure materials and limited production. These influenced the coins by causing variations in design, limited mintages, and the commemorative nature of some coins like the Peso del Sitio."

Let me scan through the text. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's mention of the Casa de Moneda being inaugurated by the Political and Police Chief of Montevideo, Andr\u00e9s Lamas, in 1844. Then, in Passage 2, there's a section about the second stage. Specifically, sentence [S87] says that after the first period, the Casa de Moneda continued to depend on the Political Chief until May 27, 1844, when it became dependent on the Ministry of Finance, which was held by Andr\u00e9s Lamas. \n\nSo, the transition happened on May 27, 1844, when control moved from the Political Chief to the Ministry of Finance. Now, what's the impact on operations? The next sentences mention that Lamas resigned in September 1844 due to denunciations about irregularities. Then Santiago Sayago took over, ordered the mint to open again, and they inspected the stamps, which were in poor condition. They got new ones engraved. During this period, only 40 cent coins were issued. The second stage lasted until mid-January 1845 when it closed, and materials were returned.\n\nSo the consequences include the resignation of Lamas, a new director being appointed, the inspection and replacement of stamps, limited coin production (only 40 cent coins), and eventual closure. The transition might have led to administrative changes, possible inefficiencies due to the poor condition of stamps, and the eventual shutdown. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The transition is mentioned in [S87], the resignation in [S88], the new director in [S89], the stamp inspection in [S90], the limited issues in [S91], and the closure in [S92]. \n\nSo the answer should state that the transition led to changes in leadership, inspection of equipment, limited production, and eventual closure. The citations would be [S87] for the transition, [S88] for the resignation, [S89] for the new director, [S90] for the stamp inspection, [S91] for the limited issues, and [S92] for the closure. \n\nI need to structure each sentence with the appropriate citations. Let me check if there are any other relevant sentences. The passage also mentions that during the second stage, only 40 cent coins were issued, which is [S91]. The closure is [S92]. \n\nSo the impact includes the shift in control, leading to new management, which then resulted in the inspection of stamps, limited production, and eventual closure.

[S20] ### The Great War\n\nThe Great War was one of the events that had the greatest impact on the issues, in this context the first minting attempts of the classic period were developed and had a notable impact, limiting and in many cases canceling the issues. [S21] This conflict began in 1839 in Argentinean territory, and that confronted General Fructuoso Rivera and General Manuel Oribe, had moved since 1842 to the territory of the Republic. [S22] General Manuel Oribe burst into Uruguayan territory and reached the city of Montevideo, laying siege to the capital, which became known as the Siege of Montevideo. [S23] Once this siege was installed, two governments were declared; on the one hand, the so-called Defense Government, led by Rivera and installed in the city (until May 13, 1843, when Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez took over as president), and the Cerrito Government, led by Oribe, who claimed the presidency in Cerrito de la Victoria. [S24] ## First national minting\n\nAlthough the law authorizing this minting dates back to 1839, the first works to carry it out date from May 8, 1840, date on which the engraver Agust\u00edn Jouve presents a proposal to the Executive Power to carry out this activity. [S25] The Executive Power quickly accepted the engraver's proposal, since it was very convenient for the State, which took place on May 9 of that same year. [S26] Immediately Agust\u00edn Jouve began the work but encountered many problems such as, for example, the shortage of copper and its high price in the market at the time. [S27] To solve the problem and start with the issue, the State agrees to a proposal from Jouve to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs agreed in the initial proposal. [S28] In spite of this, only $500 were minted, which were delivered in two batches, one of $400 on October 3 and the other on October 7, 1840, in violation of the contract that established an amount of $20,000. [S29] These coins were quickly put into circulation by the government on October 15, 1840. [S30] This date was declared \"National Numismatic Day\" in 1990 by decision of the Executive Power to remember this important event in the history of Uruguay. [S31] These works were carried out in a small workshop owned by Jouve, which was called \"*Taller y Armer\u00eda Jouve*\" and was located at 300 25 de Mayo Street.

[S94] On June 24, 1854, Laws No. [S95] 414 and 418 were enacted authorizing the minting of gold coins of 10, 20 and 40 reales together with coins of 5, 20 and 40 hundredths of copper. [S96] The minting in gold was never carried out, while in copper only coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos were issued, bearing the years 1854 and 1855. [S97] #### Issue 5 and 20 cent.

[S108] Only one assay minted for a value of 40 reales in 1854, on the reverse of which there is the imprint of an M\u00ba that would identify the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*. [S109] The assays made in this mint are detailed below. [S110] ### 1840, 5 cents\n\nThere are very few known copies of this piece, in which the coin blanks used for its minting are thicker than the rest and its weight is very close to the legal weight. [S111] This is why some numismatists maintain (based on the few copies) that it is an assay, while others (based on the weight of the piece) maintain that it is one of the first minted and that the coin blanks were reduced to economize its production. [S112] ### 1843, 20 cents\n\nThere is only one specimen in the National Historical Museum, stamped in lead, which corresponds to the first proof of the 20 cent coin issued on the afternoon of December 13, 1843. [S113] ### 1854, 40 reales\n\nLaw N\u00ba 414 of June 24, 1854 established the minting of gold coins of 40 reales (in addition to 10 and 20 reales), which was never carried out. [S114] However, very few of these coins were minted, with a module of 22 mm and a weight of 7 grams. [S115] These are the only pieces to bear the mint mark (M\u00ba). [S116] ## End of the classical period\n\nThe classic period culminated with the definitive closing of the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, which took place at the beginning of the second half of 1855, and from then on, all Uruguayan coins were minted in foreign mints. [S117] During this period, 328,500 copper pieces were minted and only 1,000 silver pieces corresponding to the *Peso de Sitio* were minted; no gold coins were minted. [S118] Of this number of pieces, only a very small number have been minted up to the 21st century, and in the case of some variants, only one specimen is known, making them the most coveted coins of the Uruguayan monetary system, not only because of their scarcity, but also because of their great historical value.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the differences between the 1854-1855 minting efforts and the 1840 minting, and what the 'Forced' 4 on the 1854 5 centavo coin suggests about the technical or administrative practices of the time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me start by scanning the passage for information about the 1840 minting. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a section about the first national minting starting in 1840. It mentions that the law was from 1839, but the actual work began in May 1840. The engraver Agust\u00edn Jouve faced issues like copper shortages and had to be indemnified. Only $500 worth of coins were minted, which was way below the $20,000 target. The coins were made in a small workshop, and there's a table with details about the 5 and 20 centavo coins from 1840. The 5 centavo was called \"cinqui\u00f1o\" and had specific weight and size.\n\nNow, looking at Passage 2 for 1854-1855. The National Mint was re-established in 1854, with different people involved: Juan Gard as Director, Agust\u00edn Rivero as engraver. Laws 414 and 418 authorized minting, but gold wasn't done. Copper coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos were made, with 1854 and 1855 dates. The 1854 5 centavo has a \"Forced\" 4, which is mentioned in [S102] and [S103]. The table shows the 1854 5 centavo has a legal weight of 5.38g, real weight 5.2g, same module as 1840. The 1855 coins were similar but with different amounts minted. Also, the 1855 5 centavo had a slightly different weight range.\n\nComparing the two periods: The 1840 minting had significant issues like material shortages, lower production quantity, and a smaller workshop. The 1854-1855 efforts seem more organized, with higher quantities (120,000 5 centavos in 1854 vs. ~6,000 in 1840). The 1854 coins had a more standardized process, but the 'Forced' 4 suggests using older dies from 1840 or 1844, which might indicate either a lack of new dies or a deliberate choice, possibly due to technical limitations or administrative shortcuts. The presence of the 'Forced' 4 could imply that they reused existing equipment, which might point to either resource constraints or a lack of proper minting infrastructure at the time.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the differences, mention the 1840 issues with copper and production quantity [S26][S27][S28][S29], and the 1854-1855 having more coins [S96][S98][S105]. The 'Forced' 4 is in [S102][S103]. Also, note that the 1854 5 centavo's characteristics are similar to 1840 [S102], which supports the idea of using old dies."

[S108] Only one assay minted for a value of 40 reales in 1854, on the reverse of which there is the imprint of an M\u00ba that would identify the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*. [S109] The assays made in this mint are detailed below. [S110] ### 1840, 5 cents\n\nThere are very few known copies of this piece, in which the coin blanks used for its minting are thicker than the rest and its weight is very close to the legal weight. [S111] This is why some numismatists maintain (based on the few copies) that it is an assay, while others (based on the weight of the piece) maintain that it is one of the first minted and that the coin blanks were reduced to economize its production. [S112] ### 1843, 20 cents\n\nThere is only one specimen in the National Historical Museum, stamped in lead, which corresponds to the first proof of the 20 cent coin issued on the afternoon of December 13, 1843. [S113] ### 1854, 40 reales\n\nLaw N\u00ba 414 of June 24, 1854 established the minting of gold coins of 40 reales (in addition to 10 and 20 reales), which was never carried out. [S114] However, very few of these coins were minted, with a module of 22 mm and a weight of 7 grams. [S115] These are the only pieces to bear the mint mark (M\u00ba). [S116] ## End of the classical period\n\nThe classic period culminated with the definitive closing of the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, which took place at the beginning of the second half of 1855, and from then on, all Uruguayan coins were minted in foreign mints. [S117] During this period, 328,500 copper pieces were minted and only 1,000 silver pieces corresponding to the *Peso de Sitio* were minted; no gold coins were minted. [S118] Of this number of pieces, only a very small number have been minted up to the 21st century, and in the case of some variants, only one specimen is known, making them the most coveted coins of the Uruguayan monetary system, not only because of their scarcity, but also because of their great historical value.",
      "chunk_list": [
        "[S16] These measures were not enough to alleviate the shortage situation, despite the fact that the number of coins issued was considerable (2 million), and led the Government to take new measures in 1839 by means of Law No. [S17] 208 of June 20. [S18] This law creates a new monetary system in which the *Peso* or *Patac\u00f3n* is divided into 8 reales and each one of them into one hundred cent\u00e9simos (a system that will last until 1862) and authorizes the issuance of coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos (for an amount of $20,000). [S19] These coins will be the first to bear national signs. [S20] ### The Great War\n\nThe Great War was one of the events that had the greatest impact on the issues, in this context the first minting attempts of the classic period were developed and had a notable impact, limiting and in many cases canceling the issues. [S21] This conflict began in 1839 in Argentinean territory, and that confronted General Fructuoso Rivera and General Manuel Oribe, had moved since 1842 to the territory of the Republic. [S22] General Manuel Oribe burst into Uruguayan territory and reached the city of Montevideo, laying siege to the capital, which became known as the Siege of Montevideo. [S23] Once this siege was installed, two governments were declared; on the one hand, the so-called Defense Government, led by Rivera and installed in the city (until May 13, 1843, when Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez took over as president), and the Cerrito Government, led by Oribe, who claimed the presidency in Cerrito de la Victoria. [S24] ## First national minting\n\nAlthough the law authorizing this minting dates back to 1839, the first works to carry it out date from May 8, 1840, date on which the engraver Agust\u00edn Jouve presents a proposal to the Executive Power to carry out this activity. [S25] The Executive Power quickly accepted the engraver's proposal, since it was very convenient for the State, which took place on May 9 of that same year. [S26] Immediately Agust\u00edn Jouve began the work but encountered many problems such as, for example, the shortage of copper and its high price in the market at the time. [S27] To solve the problem and start with the issue, the State agrees to a proposal from Jouve to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs agreed in the initial proposal. [S28] In spite of this, only $500 were minted, which were delivered in two batches, one of $400 on October 3 and the other on October 7, 1840, in violation of the contract that established an amount of $20,000. [S29] These coins were quickly put into circulation by the government on October 15, 1840. [S30] This date was declared \"National Numismatic Day\" in 1990 by decision of the Executive Power to remember this important event in the history of Uruguay. [S31] These works were carried out in a small workshop owned by Jouve, which was called \"*Taller y Armer\u00eda Jouve*\" and was located at 300 25 de Mayo Street.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the evidence in the source that shows the 1840 and 1854 coin issuances were influenced by economic constraints and political instability, and how these factors affected the design and circulation of the coins.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages for mentions of economic and political factors around those years. Let me start with the 1840 coins. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a mention of the 1839 law (S18) that created a new monetary system. Then, in S26, it says that the Executive Power accepted Jouve's proposal quickly because it was convenient for the State. But then in S26, it mentions that Agust\u00edn Jouve encountered problems like the shortage of copper and its high price. To solve this, the State agreed to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs. However, only $500 were minted instead of the planned $20,000. This seems like an economic constraint\u2014shortage of materials and high costs. Also, the fact that they had to reduce the amount minted indicates economic issues.\n\nThen, the coins were put into circulation quickly (S29), maybe due to the need to address the shortage. The design aspects: the coins were the first to bear national signs (S19), which might be a political move to assert national identity during unstable times. Also, the 1840 coins had specific weight and metal details, which might be due to the available materials. The mention of the \"cinqui\u00f1o\" name (S36) relates to Portuguese influence, but not sure if that's directly related to the question.\n\nNow for 1854. In Passage 2, S93 mentions the National Mint was re-established in 1854, but the minting of gold coins didn't happen. Only copper coins were issued. The 1854 coins had issues with the 5 cent piece's date being \"Forced\" (S102), which might indicate using old molds, possibly due to resource constraints. Also, the 20 cent coins from 1854 were minted in 1855 (S104), suggesting delays or ongoing issues. \n\nEconomic constraints here could be the lack of gold for minting, leading to only copper coins. Political instability might be related to the ongoing conflicts mentioned earlier, like the Great War (S20), which started in 1839 and affected the minting. The Siege of Montevideo (S22) and the two governments (S23) indicate political instability. \n\nFor the design and circulation, the 1854 coins had specific characteristics, like the 24mm module for 5 cents (S99), which might be standardization efforts. The fact that they were minted in the Government Fort (S93) could be a political decision. Also, the 1854 coins had a higher quantity (120,000 5 cent pieces) compared to 1840's 6,000 (S33 vs S98), but maybe that's due to different circumstances. However, the 1854 minting had issues with the date, which might be due to using old equipment or materials, indicating economic constraints.\n\nI need to make sure each point is tied to a citation. For example, the copper shortage in 1840 is S26 and S27. The political instability from the Great War and Siege of Montevideo is S20, S21, S22, S23. The design aspects like national signs (S19) and the forced date (S102) are relevant. Also, the 1854 coins not using gold (S96) shows economic constraints. \n\nI should structure the answer by first addressing the evidence for economic and political factors, then how they affected design and circulation. Each statement needs to have the correct citations. Let me check again to ensure all citations are accurate and that each point is covered."

      "question": "How do the assays and mint marks mentioned in the source, particularly the 1854 40 reales assay, contribute to our understanding of the technical and administrative practices of the Classical Monetary System in Uruguay?",
      "answer": "<statement>The assays and mint marks, particularly the 1854 40 reales assay, provide critical insights into the technical and administrative practices of Uruguay's Classical Monetary System. The absence of mint marks on most coins during the Classical Period, except for the 1854 40 reales assay, highlights the limited standardization of identification practices, while the presence of the M\u00ba imprint on this specific assay indicates a deliberate effort to associate the coin with the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* [S108][S109][S116]. This suggests administrative control over minting operations and quality assurance, as assays were likely used to verify compliance with legal weight and metal standards [S110]. The 1854 40 reales assay also reflects technical experimentation, as it was part of a law authorizing gold coins that were never fully minted, yet surviving specimens with unique characteristics (e.g., 22 mm module, 7 grams weight) demonstrate precision in production [S114][S115]. These details reveal both the challenges of resource management (e.g., copper shortages) and the procedural rigor in minting, even during periods of limited capacity [S26][S28].<cite>[S108][S109][S110][S114][S115][S116]</cite></statement><statement>The 1854 40 reales assay further underscores the administrative complexity of the period, as it was tied to legal frameworks like Law No. 414, which mandated gold coinage but faced practical constraints, such as the lack of gold reserves or technical capacity [S114]. The assay\u2019s role in testing minting processes aligns with broader practices seen in earlier issues, such as the 1840 5-cent coin, where discrepancies in weight and blanks sparked debates over whether they were test pieces or cost-cutting measures [S111][S112]. This duality\u2014between experimental assays and mass production\u2014illustrates the interplay of technical innovation and administrative limitations in Uruguay\u2019s monetary system [S110][S111].<cite>[S110][S111][S112][S114]</cite></statement>",

[S108] Only one assay minted for a value of 40 reales in 1854, on the reverse of which there is the imprint of an M\u00ba that would identify the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*. [S109] The assays made in this mint are detailed below. [S110] ### 1840, 5 cents\n\nThere are very few known copies of this piece, in which the coin blanks used for its minting are thicker than the rest and its weight is very close to the legal weight. [S111] This is why some numismatists maintain (based on the few copies) that it is an assay, while others (based on the weight of the piece) maintain that it is one of the first minted and that the coin blanks were reduced to economize its production. [S112] ### 1843, 20 cents\n\nThere is only one specimen in the National Historical Museum, stamped in lead, which corresponds to the first proof of the 20 cent coin issued on the afternoon of December 13, 1843. [S113] ### 1854, 40 reales\n\nLaw N\u00ba 414 of June 24, 1854 established the minting of gold coins of 40 reales (in addition to 10 and 20 reales), which was never carried out. [S114] However, very few of these coins were minted, with a module of 22 mm and a weight of 7 grams. [S115] These are the only pieces to bear the mint mark (M\u00ba). [S116] ## End of the classical period\n\nThe classic period culminated with the definitive closing of the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, which took place at the beginning of the second half of 1855, and from then on, all Uruguayan coins were minted in foreign mints. [S117] During this period, 328,500 copper pieces were minted and only 1,000 silver pieces corresponding to the *Peso de Sitio* were minted; no gold coins were minted. [S118] Of this number of pieces, only a very small number have been minted up to the 21st century, and in the case of some variants, only one specimen is known, making them the most coveted coins of the Uruguayan monetary system, not only because of their scarcity, but also because of their great historical value.",

        "[S16] These measures were not enough to alleviate the shortage situation, despite the fact that the number of coins issued was considerable (2 million), and led the Government to take new measures in 1839 by means of Law No. [S17] 208 of June 20. [S18] This law creates a new monetary system in which the *Peso* or *Patac\u00f3n* is divided into 8 reales and each one of them into one hundred cent\u00e9simos (a system that will last until 1862) and authorizes the issuance of coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos (for an amount of $20,000). [S19] These coins will be the first to bear national signs. [S20] ### The Great War\n\nThe Great War was one of the events that had the greatest impact on the issues, in this context the first minting attempts of the classic period were developed and had a notable impact, limiting and in many cases canceling the issues. [S21] This conflict began in 1839 in Argentinean territory, and that confronted General Fructuoso Rivera and General Manuel Oribe, had moved since 1842 to the territory of the Republic. [S22] General Manuel Oribe burst into Uruguayan territory and reached the city of Montevideo, laying siege to the capital, which became known as the Siege of Montevideo. [S23] Once this siege was installed, two governments were declared; on the one hand, the so-called Defense Government, led by Rivera and installed in the city (until May 13, 1843, when Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez took over as president), and the Cerrito Government, led by Oribe, who claimed the presidency in Cerrito de la Victoria. [S24] ## First national minting\n\nAlthough the law authorizing this minting dates back to 1839, the first works to carry it out date from May 8, 1840, date on which the engraver Agust\u00edn Jouve presents a proposal to the Executive Power to carry out this activity. [S25] The Executive Power quickly accepted the engraver's proposal, since it was very convenient for the State, which took place on May 9 of that same year. [S26] Immediately Agust\u00edn Jouve began the work but encountered many problems such as, for example, the shortage of copper and its high price in the market at the time. [S27] To solve the problem and start with the issue, the State agrees to a proposal from Jouve to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs agreed in the initial proposal. [S28] In spite of this, only $500 were minted, which were delivered in two batches, one of $400 on October 3 and the other on October 7, 1840, in violation of the contract that established an amount of $20,000. [S29] These coins were quickly put into circulation by the government on October 15, 1840. [S30] This date was declared \"National Numismatic Day\" in 1990 by decision of the Executive Power to remember this important event in the history of Uruguay. [S31] These works were carried out in a small workshop owned by Jouve, which was called \"*Taller y Armer\u00eda Jouve*\" and was located at 300 25 de Mayo Street.

[S94] On June 24, 1854, Laws No. [S95] 414 and 418 were enacted authorizing the minting of gold coins of 10, 20 and 40 reales together with coins of 5, 20 and 40 hundredths of copper. [S96] The minting in gold was never carried out, while in copper only coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos were issued, bearing the years 1854 and 1855. [S97] #### Issue 5 and 20 cent.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the assays and mint marks mentioned, especially the 1854 40 reales assay, contribute to our understanding of the technical and administrative practices of the Classical Monetary System in Uruguay.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information. The key sections here are under \"Assays and mintmark\" in Passage 2. Let me check those sentences.\n\nLooking at the context, [S108] mentions that none of the coins from the Classical Period have a mint mark, except for the 1854 40 reales assay which has an M\u00ba imprint. [S109] says this M\u00ba identifies the Casa de Moneda de Montevideo. [S110] refers to the assays made in this mint. Then, [S114] talks about the 40 reales law not being minted, but some pieces were made with a 22mm module and 7g weight. [S115] and [S116] confirm that these are the only ones with the mint mark.\n\nSo, the 1854 40 reales assay is significant because it's the only one with a mint mark, indicating the Casa de Moneda's involvement. This suggests that even though most coins didn't have mint marks, there were specific instances where they were used, possibly for quality control or identification. The assay itself might have been a test to ensure the coins met standards, showing administrative practices like quality checks. Also, the fact that the 40 reales wasn't actually minted but some pieces exist might indicate experimental or trial minting, which is part of the technical practices.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of assays like the 1840 5 cents being possibly test coins (S111, S112) shows that there were procedures to check the minting process. The lack of mint marks on most coins might relate to the administrative practices of the time, maybe due to the mint's operations or the era's standards.\n\nPutting this together, the assays and the single mint mark from 1854 provide insights into the technical aspects (like quality control, experimental minting) and administrative practices (identification of the mint, adherence to laws). The 1854 assay's unique mint mark helps identify the Casa de Moneda's role, even though most coins didn't have such marks. This contributes to understanding how the system managed production and quality, even with limited documentation or standardization."

[S11] However, precious metal coins (gold and silver) continued to circulate until 1893 (accepted until then for their intrinsic value), when their circulation was definitively prohibited. [S12] With the arrival of the first Constitutional President of the Republic, General Fructuoso Rivera, important measures continued to be taken, ordering in 1831 the withdrawal of all foreign copper currency. [S13] As a result of these measures, the city suffered a serious lack of foreign currency, so the government began to look for a quick solution to supply the needs of commerce. [S14] A solution to this situation was found by means of the law of March 14, 1831, which provided for the issuance of the currency known as \"Tenths of the city of Buenos Aires\" for half of its written value.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the *Peso del Sitio* and *Sol de cabellera* in Uruguayan numismatics and what their current status indicates about their historical value.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find mentions of these coins. Scanning through, I see in [S6] that these two coins are mentioned as part of the classical period, and they are now museum pieces or in important collections, highly coveted by collectors. That seems relevant to their significance and current status.\n\nThe question also asks why they were significant. The passage mentions that during the classical period, there were attempts to create a national currency amidst economic chaos and civil war. The coins were part of these efforts. The context in [S3] and [S4] talks about the historical challenges, so maybe the significance is that they were part of the national efforts to establish a monetary system despite the turmoil. \n\nThe current status part is covered in [S6], stating they are museum pieces or in collections, and valued by collectors. This indicates their historical value because they are preserved and sought after. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The significance is probably tied to the historical context of the classical monetary system and the attempts to create a national currency. The current status is directly in [S6]. \n\nSo, the answer should connect their significance to the historical efforts during the chaotic period and their current status as preserved and valuable items. Citations would be [S6] for the current status and [S3][S4] for the historical context. Wait, but the question is why they were significant. The passage says they were part of the classical period, which was a time of economic problems and attempts to mint national coins. So maybe [S3] and [S4] explain the context, and [S6] explains their current status. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Let me check again. The first part of the question is about significance, so the reasons would be the historical context of economic issues and the attempt to create a national currency. The second part is about current status indicating historical value, which is in [S6]. \n\nSo, the answer would have two statements: one explaining their significance with citations to [S3][S4], and another about their current status with [S6]. But the user might want a single statement combining both parts. Wait, the user's question is two parts: why were they significant, and what does their current status indicate. So maybe two separate statements. Let me check the example response format. The example has two statements, each with their own citations. So I should structure it similarly.\n\nSo first statement: The *Peso del Sitio* and *Sol de cabellera* were significant because they were part of the classical monetary system during a period of economic chaos and civil war, as noted in [S3] and [S4]. Second statement: Their current status as museum pieces and valuable collections indicates their historical value, as stated in [S6]. \n\nI need to make sure the sentences are correctly cited. Also, check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. For example, [S5] mentions they were minted in 1839 and until 1855, but maybe that's not directly relevant to their significance. The key points are the historical context and their current status. So the citations should be [S3][S4] for significance and [S6] for current status."

[S15] These coins with a value of one tenth of a real were the first coins issued by the Oriental Republic of Uruguay.",
    "[S16] These measures were not enough to alleviate the shortage situation, despite the fact that the number of coins issued was considerable (2 million), and led the Government to take new measures in 1839 by means of Law No. [S17] 208 of June 20. [S18] This law creates a new monetary system in which the *Peso* or *Patac\u00f3n* is divided into 8 reales and each one of them into one hundred cent\u00e9simos (a system that will last until 1862) and authorizes the issuance of coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos (for an amount of $20,000). [S19] These coins will be the first to bear national signs. [S20] ### The Great War\n\nThe Great War was one of the events that had the greatest impact on the issues, in this context the first minting attempts of the classic period were developed and had a notable impact, limiting and in many cases canceling the issues. [S21] This conflict began in 1839 in Argentinean territory, and that confronted General Fructuoso Rivera and General Manuel Oribe, had moved since 1842 to the territory of the Republic. [S22] General Manuel Oribe burst into Uruguayan territory and reached the city of Montevideo, laying siege to the capital, which became known as the Siege of Montevideo. [S23] Once this siege was installed, two governments were declared; on the one hand, the so-called Defense Government, led by Rivera and installed in the city (until May 13, 1843, when Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez took over as president), and the Cerrito Government, led by Oribe, who claimed the presidency in Cerrito de la Victoria. [S24] ## First national minting\n\nAlthough the law authorizing this minting dates back to 1839, the first works to carry it out date from May 8, 1840, date on which the engraver Agust\u00edn Jouve presents a proposal to the Executive Power to carry out this activity. [S25] The Executive Power quickly accepted the engraver's proposal, since it was very convenient for the State, which took place on May 9 of that same year. [S26] Immediately Agust\u00edn Jouve began the work but encountered many problems such as, for example, the shortage of copper and its high price in the market at the time. [S27] To solve the problem and start with the issue, the State agrees to a proposal from Jouve to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs agreed in the initial proposal. [S28] In spite of this, only $500 were minted, which were delivered in two batches, one of $400 on October 3 and the other on October 7, 1840, in violation of the contract that established an amount of $20,000. [S29] These coins were quickly put into circulation by the government on October 15, 1840. [S30] This date was declared \"National Numismatic Day\" in 1990 by decision of the Executive Power to remember this important event in the history of Uruguay. [S31] These works were carried out in a small workshop owned by Jouve, which was called \"*Taller y Armer\u00eda Jouve*\" and was located at 300 25 de Mayo Street. [S32] ### Characteristics of the minted pieces (5 and 20 cent. [S33] of 1840)\n\n| Minting in 1840 | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Value | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 5 cent.

[S35] | 28,7 g | 26,5 - 27,8 grams | 37\u00a0mm | 18.500 (approx.) |\n\n* The 5 cent. [S36] coin was popularly known as \"*cinqui\u00f1o*\", coming from the Portuguese term *Cinquinho*, which corresponded to a silver coin of King Manuel of Portugal with a value of 5 reis.\u1d56\u1d43\u1d4d\u1d49\u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n## Casa de Moneda de Montevideo\n\nThe *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* or *Casa de Moneda Nacional* was the institution in charge of the official issuance of coins in the Oriental Republic of Uruguay from 1843 to 1855, although the activity was interrupted on several occasions.",
    "[S37] It was created in order to comply with Laws No. [S38] 254 and No. [S39] 255 of December 13, 1843, which empowered the Government to issue coins of 5, 20 and 40 hundredths of real (copper) and Half and One *Peso Fuerte* (silver). [S40] The same day these laws were enacted, the first tests were carried out, minting coins of 20 hundredths of a real. [S41] In spite of this, the institution was officially inaugurated on February 2, 1844, by the then Political and Police Chief of Montevideo, Andr\u00e9s Lamas, installing itself in a small workshop in the building of the Police Headquarters of the city called *Casa Central de Polic\u00eda*. [S42] ### First period of issues by the Casa de Monedas\n\nThere are two distinct stages in the first period of the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, which are detailed below. [S43] ### First stage\n\nThis stage began with the minting of a 20 cent\u00e9simos coin on the afternoon of December 13 and lasted until mid-March 1844, when the Mint suspended its activities. [S44] During this period the institution depended on the Political Chief of the city of Montevideo and its director was Don Domingo Parpal and minted coins of 20 cent\u00e9simos of 1843, 5, 20 and 40 cent\u00e9simos of 1844 in addition to the magnificent piece of the *Peso Fuerte* or *Peso del Sitio*. [S45] All these pieces were made in the workshop located in the *\"Casa Central de Polic\u00eda\"*. [S46] #### First issue (20 cent 1843)\n\nImmediately after the promulgation of Law No. [S47] 254 of December 13, 1843, the first trials were carried out by issuing 20 cent coins with the same stamps used by Agust\u00edn Jouve in 1839, with the date changed from 1840 to 1843. [S48] The characteristic of these pieces is that since the date was modified, the number 3 appears forced. [S49] These pieces are the first issued by the *Casa de Moneda Nacional*. [S50] | 20 cents of 1843 | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Valoe | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 20 cent.

[S53] They were pieces that contributed to give solidity to the development of commerce and helped to put an end to the great shortage of circulating currency that existed in the new Republic. [S54] | **Minting in 1844** | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Value | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 5 cent. [S55] | N.\u00b0 254 of the day December 13, 1843. [S56] | 5,38 grams | 5,4 - 5,7 grams | Copper | 24\u00a0mm | Smooth | Agust\u00edn Jouve | 6.000 (approx.) |\n| 20 cent.

[S58] | 43 grams | 36 - 42 grams | 38 \u2013 42\u00a0mm | 65.000 (approx.) |\n\n* Five different mintages are known for the 5 cent. [S59] piece. [S60] * The 40 cent. [S61] coin was the only one minted at the Mint with this value. [S62] For its minting, a number of stamps were used that have not yet been accurately determined, so that more than 20 variants of this piece are known. [S63] One of these variants is known as the \"*Sol de Cabellera*\", since on the obverse the face of the sun corresponds to a native with long hair. [S64] Due to its great relief, it is very rare to find specimens in good condition, which makes it a very coveted piece by collectors. [S65] #### *Peso del Sitio* or *Peso Fuerte*",
    "[S66] This piece is the only silver coin to be minted at the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*. [S67] This minting was carried out in an extremely reduced number (a little more than 1,000) due to the scarcity of materials. [S68] This shortage of materials (caused by the Siege of Montevideo) could be overcome because materials were collected inside the besieged square. [S69] *Mates*, spoons, light bulbs, spurs, etc., all made of silver, were collected from the citizens, among them Andr\u00e9s Lamas himself or personalities such as Giuseppe Garibaldi or Isidoro de Mar\u00eda.\u1d56\u1d43\u1d4d\u1d49\u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 The collected silver, naturally impure, product of the different qualities of silver collected, was analyzed by the expert chemist Professor Julio Antonio Lenoble, who classified the material with a fine 10 1/2 dineros (0.875). [S70] #### Characteristics of the *Peso del Sitio*\n\n| ***Peso del Sitio* o *Peso Fuerte*** | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Value | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 1 peso. [S71] | N.\u00b0 254 of December 13, 1843. [S72] | 27 grams | 27 grams | Silver, fine 10 1/2 (*dinero*) | 39\u00a0mm | *Cordoncillo* | Agust\u00edn Jouve | 1.000 (approx.) |\n\n* Some pieces minted on coins from other countries are known. [S73] * This piece would circulate only in Montevideo since on February 15, 1844, from his headquarters in the Cerrito de la Victoria, General Manuel Oribe (Chief of the forces that besieged Montevideo) prohibits the circulation throughout the territory of the Republic. [S74] It is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful coins of the Classical Monetary. [S75] It was minted with similar characteristics to those of a Spanish peso. [S76] It is believed that it was minted more as a commemorative element than for circulation. [S77] This idea is based on the good condition in which the specimens have arrived to our time (although some specimens undoubtedly circulated). [S78] The following is a small passage from a speech made by Andr\u00e9s Lamas to the President of the Republic, Joaqu\u00edn Su\u00e1rez, on the occasion of the inauguration of the *Casa de Moneda Nacional*. [S79] > YOUR EXCELLENCY. [S80] Sir: I have the honor to present to Your Excellency the first silver coin destined for circulation, minted at the *Casa de Moneda Nacional*. [S81] This coin, Mr. [S82] President, is monumental, and this monument is unique to this day on the eastern and western banks of the Rio de la Plata. [S83] This coin is the most finished symbol, Mr. [S84] President, of the National Independence. [S85] In all times and in the public law of all nations, the minting of coins has been the highest prerogative of the Independent Empire. [S86] ### Second stage\n\nThe *Casa de Moneda Nacional*, once out of operation, continued to depend on the Political Chief of the city of Montevideo, until May 27, 1844, when it became dependent on the Ministry of Finance (a position held by Andres Lamas). [S87] On September 20, 1844, Andr\u00e9s Lamas resigned from the Ministry of Finance due to a series of denunciations he received for irregularities committed in the *Casa de Monedas*. [S88] At the head of this ministry would now be Don Santiago Sayago who would order on October 20 the opening of the mint designating Don Juan de Bernade y Mederos as General Director. [S89] The existing stamps were immediately inspected and found to be in very poor condition, so the Director obtained authorization to have new ones engraved. [S90] During this period only 40 cent coins were issued with a date of 1844 (as was seen previously in issue 40 cent of 1844). [S91] This stage of the *Casa de Monedas* lasted until mid-January 1845, when it was definitively closed and the materials of Agust\u00edn Jouve used up to that time were returned. [S92] ### Second period of issues by the *Casa de Monedas*",
    "[S93] In 1854 the National Mint was again established (but this time in the Government Fort) and Don Juan Gard was appointed as Director, with Don Agust\u00edn Rivero as engraver and Don Francisco Didi\u00f3n as assayer. [S94] On June 24, 1854, Laws No. [S95] 414 and 418 were enacted authorizing the minting of gold coins of 10, 20 and 40 reales together with coins of 5, 20 and 40 hundredths of copper. [S96] The minting in gold was never carried out, while in copper only coins of 5 and 20 cent\u00e9simos were issued, bearing the years 1854 and 1855. [S97] #### Issue 5 and 20 cent. [S98] of 1854\n\n| **Minting in 1854** | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Value | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 5 cent.

[S101] | 21,5 grams | 19,5 - 21,5 grams | 38\u00a0mm | 50.000 (approx.) |\n\n* The 5 cent. [S102] piece has the peculiarity that the front shows the number 4 of the year 1854 \"Forced\", this would lead to the conclusion that the stamps used in 1840 or 1844 were used, but these do not have the same characteristics, being then a mystery this detail. [S103] * Pieces of 20 cents with date 1854 were minted in 1855 once the production of these last ones was finished, being identical to the ones stamped in the previous year. [S104] #### Issue 5 and 20 cent. [S105] of 1855\n\n| **Minting in 1855** | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Image | | Value | Characteristics | | | | | | | |\n| Front | Back | Law | Legal weight | Real weight | Metal | Module | Edge | Engraver | Amount minted |\n| 5 cent.

[S107] | 21,5 grams | 20 - 21 grams | 38\u00a0mm | 30.000 (approx.) |\n\n\n## Assays and mintmark\n\nNone of the coins minted in the Classical Period bear a mark that identifies their mint (mint mark). [S108] Only one assay minted for a value of 40 reales in 1854, on the reverse of which there is the imprint of an M\u00ba that would identify the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*. [S109] The assays made in this mint are detailed below. [S110] ### 1840, 5 cents\n\nThere are very few known copies of this piece, in which the coin blanks used for its minting are thicker than the rest and its weight is very close to the legal weight. [S111] This is why some numismatists maintain (based on the few copies) that it is an assay, while others (based on the weight of the piece) maintain that it is one of the first minted and that the coin blanks were reduced to economize its production. [S112] ### 1843, 20 cents\n\nThere is only one specimen in the National Historical Museum, stamped in lead, which corresponds to the first proof of the 20 cent coin issued on the afternoon of December 13, 1843. [S113] ### 1854, 40 reales\n\nLaw N\u00ba 414 of June 24, 1854 established the minting of gold coins of 40 reales (in addition to 10 and 20 reales), which was never carried out. [S114] However, very few of these coins were minted, with a module of 22 mm and a weight of 7 grams. [S115] These are the only pieces to bear the mint mark (M\u00ba). [S116] ## End of the classical period\n\nThe classic period culminated with the definitive closing of the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, which took place at the beginning of the second half of 1855, and from then on, all Uruguayan coins were minted in foreign mints. [S117] During this period, 328,500 copper pieces were minted and only 1,000 silver pieces corresponding to the *Peso de Sitio* were minted; no gold coins were minted. [S118] Of this number of pieces, only a very small number have been minted up to the 21st century, and in the case of some variants, only one specimen is known, making them the most coveted coins of the Uruguayan monetary system, not only because of their scarcity, but also because of their great historical value."
