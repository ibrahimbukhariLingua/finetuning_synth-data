      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how BB Biotech's investment strategy and portfolio composition reflect their focus on small-to-mid-cap biotech companies and which specific companies are highlighted as core holdings as of June 30, 2024.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections. Let me start by identifying the parts that discuss the investment strategy and portfolio.\n\nLooking at the \"Investment activities\" section, there's a subsection called \"Investment area.\" Sentence S9 mentions that BB Biotech is a closed-end fund focused on biotech companies. Then S10 states the primary focus is on small-to-mid-cap biotech companies in Western Europe and the US. That directly answers part of the question about their strategy. Also, S14 talks about targeting firms with established products or advanced drug candidates, which aligns with focusing on small-to-mid-cap companies that might be in later stages of development.\n\nNext, the \"Companies and core investments\" section has S19 listing the core holdings as of June 30, 2024. The companies mentioned are Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Argenx, Neurocrine Biosciences, Vertex, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Revolution Medicines, Moderna, Intra-Cellular Therapies, and Agios Pharmaceuticals. The percentages are also there, but the question specifically asks for the companies, so those names are the key.\n\nI need to make sure that the citations are correctly linked. The strategy part would cite S10, S9, S14, maybe S12. But the user wants the focus on small-to-mid-cap, so S10 is crucial. The portfolio composition is covered in S19. \n\nWait, the question also asks how the strategy and portfolio reflect the focus. So the answer should connect the investment areas (small-to-mid-cap) with the portfolio holdings. The passage says they focus on small-to-mid-cap (S10), and their portfolio includes those companies. The core holdings are listed in S19. \n\nSo the answer should mention that the strategy focuses on small-to-mid-cap (S10) and that the core holdings as of the date are the companies listed in S19. Also, maybe mention that they have a bottom-up approach (S15) and the structure of 5-8 core holdings (S17). But the main citations would be S10 for the strategy and S19 for the companies.\n\nI need to structure the answer into statements with proper citations. Each sentence should have its citations. Let me check again:\n\n- The investment strategy's focus on small-to-mid-cap is in S10.\n- The portfolio composition includes 35 companies with 5-8 core holdings (S16, S17).\n- The specific companies are in S19.\n\nSo the first statement would be about the strategy, citing S10, S9, S14. Then the portfolio composition citing S16, S17. Then the specific companies in S19. But the user wants the answer to reflect how the strategy and portfolio show the focus. So maybe combine the strategy part and the portfolio structure.\n\nAlso, the user might want to know that the core holdings are part of the portfolio that's focused on small-to-mid-cap. But the passage doesn't explicitly say the core holdings are small-to-mid-cap, just that the overall portfolio is. However, since the core holdings are part of the portfolio, they would be included in that focus.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nBB Biotech's investment strategy focuses on small-to-mid-cap biotech companies (S10), with a portfolio that includes around 35 companies, 5-8 core holdings making up 70% of the value (S16, S17). The core holdings as of June 30, 2024, are listed in S19.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with citations. Let me structure it properly."

The passage mentions that BB Biotech has been listed on several exchanges. Specifically, it was on the SIX Swiss Exchange since 1993, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt since 1997, the TecDAX from 2003 to 2012, then back again from 2012 to 2015. Also, it was on the Italian Nuovo Mercato from 2000 to 2023, including the Star segment since 2005. \n\nThe question is about how these listings affected their market presence. Being listed on multiple exchanges, especially major ones like SIX and Deutsche B\u00f6rse, likely increased their visibility and accessibility to a broader range of investors. The TecDAX is a German stock index for technology and innovation companies, so being part of that would position them as a tech-focused company, which aligns with their biotech investments. Their return to the TecDAX and Star segment might indicate a strategic move to reassert their presence in a specialized market, possibly to attract investors interested in high-growth sectors. The Star segment is for innovative companies, so this could suggest they're emphasizing their innovative aspects or aiming to attract more tech-savvy investors.\n\nI need to check the citations. The relevant sentences are S6 (Deutsche B\u00f6rse listing), S7 (TecDAX periods), and S8 (Italian Nuovo Mercato and Star segment). The return to TecDAX and Star is mentioned in S7 and S8. The influence on market presence would be tied to being on these exchanges, which are significant for visibility and investor base.\n\nSo, the answer should connect their listings on these exchanges to increased market presence, and the return to TecDAX and Star as a strategic move to focus on innovation and tech sectors. Citations would be [S6][S7][S8]."
