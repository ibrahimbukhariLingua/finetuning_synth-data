      "answer": "<statement>The post-bankruptcy liquidation and administrative processes of Lehman Brothers reflected the scale of its financial obligations through the massive payments made to creditors. For example, as of January 2016, Lehman paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors, and its brokerage unit completed a liquidation process in 2022 after paying out over $115 billion to customers and creditors over 14 years.<cite>[S212][S215]</cite></statement> <statement>The administrative processes also highlighted the complexity of its obligations, as seen in the ongoing management of its British operations by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which expected to complete the administration process by 2025.<cite>[S216]</cite></statement> <statement>Settlements with entities like JPMorgan played a significant role in addressing these obligations. JPMorgan agreed to pay $1.42 billion to settle a lawsuit accusing it of draining Lehman\u2019s liquidity before the 2008 crash, with additional funds of $1.496 billion allocated for creditors and a $76 million deposit.<cite>[S213][S214]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S203] On March 11, 2010, Anton R. [S204] Valukas, a court-appointed examiner, published the results of its year-long investigation into the finances of Lehman Brothers. [S205] This report revealed that Lehman Brothers used an accounting procedure termed repo 105 to temporarily exchange $50\u00a0billion of assets into cash just before publishing its financial statements. [S206] The action could be seen to implicate both Ernst & Young, the bank's accountancy firm and Richard S. [S207] Fuld, Jr, the former CEO. [S208] This could potentially lead to Ernst & Young being found guilty of financial malpractice and Fuld facing time in prison. [S209] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, in March 2011, the SEC announced that they weren't confident that they could prove that Lehman Brothers violated US laws in its accounting practices. [S210] In October 2011, the administrators of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. [S211] lost their appeal to overturn a court order forcing them to pay \u00a3148 million into their underfunded pensions plan. [S212] As of January 2016, Lehman paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors. [S213] In addition, JPMorgan will pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of draining Lehman Brothers liquidity right before the crash. [S214] The settlement would permit another $1.496 billion to be paid to creditors and a separate $76 million deposit. [S215] The brokerage unit of Lehman Brothers completed its liquidation process on September 28, 2022, after paying out over $115 billion to its customers and creditors over the course of 14 years. [S216] As of December 2022, Lehman's British operations were being administrated by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which expected to complete the administration process no earlier than 2025. [S217] ## Merger and acquisition history\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):\n\n\n## Former officers\n\n* Richard S. [S218] Fuld Jr. [S219] * Scott J. [S220] Freidheim\n* Rodger Krouse (born 1961)\n* Jack Langer (born 1948/1949), basketball player and investment banker\n* Bart McDade\n* Hugh McGee\n* George Herbert Walker IV\n* Frederick M. [S221] Warburg\n* Joseph Rosenberg\n\n## In popular culture\n\nThe events of the weekend leading up to Lehman's bankruptcy are dramatized in the 2009 BBC television film *The Last Days of Lehman Brothers*. [S222] In the 2010 animated film *Despicable Me*, the main character Gru visits the Bank of Evil, which funds all evil plots for villains around the world and has a sign reading \"Formerly Lehman Brothers\". [S223] The 2011 drama film *Margin Call* focuses on the events of a 24-hour period at a large investment bank based on an amalgam of investment banks, drawing heavily from the culture of Lehman Brothers. [S224] However, the events in the film are primarily a depiction of the actions of Goldman Sachs. [S225] The 2011 HBO film *Too Big to Fail* recounts the days before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the fallout afterward. [S226] The 2011 film *Horrible Bosses* features a character by the name of Kenny Sommerfield (played by P. [S227] J. [S228] Byrne) who worked at Lehman Brothers until its bankruptcy, ending up broke. [S229] The fall of Lehman Brothers is depicted in the 2015 film *The Big Short*, where two of the characters walk around the Lehman Brothers offices after the bankruptcy to see the main trading floor. [S230] In Imbolo Mbue's 2016 debut novel *Behold the Dreamers*, an immigrant from Cameroon is a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers. [S231] In the 2016 animated film *Zootopia*, there is a brief appearance of a bank called Lemming Brothers, which is staffed by lemmings. [S232] *The Lehman Trilogy* is a three-act play by Italian dramatist Stefano Massini about the history of the Lehman Brothers. [S233] In the 2019 Showtime comedy series *Black Monday*, a fictionalized version of Lehman Brothers with an altered spelling is central to the plot and represented by brothers Larry & Lenny Leighman. [S234] ## Principal locations (first year of occupancy)\n\nPassage 2:\n[S64] Upset bankers, who had soured over the power struggle, left the company. [S65] Stephen A. [S66] Schwarzman, chairman of the firm's M&A committee, recalled in a February 2003 interview with *Private Equity International* that \"Lehman Brothers had an extremely competitive internal environment, which ultimately became dysfunctional.\" The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm. [S67] ### Merger with American Express (1984\u20131994)\n\nShearson/American Express, an American Express-owned securities company focused on brokerage rather than investment banking, acquired Lehman in 1984, for $360\u00a0million. [S68] On May 11, the combined firms became Shearson Lehman/American Express. [S69] From 1983 to 1990, Peter A. [S70] Cohen was CEO and chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he led the $1 billion purchase of E.F. [S71] Hutton to form Shearson Lehman Hutton. [S72] In 1989, Shearson backed F. [S73] Ross Johnson's management team in its attempted management buyout of RJR Nabisco, but were ultimately outbid by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who was backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert. [S74] ### Divestment and independence (1994\u20132008)\n\nIn 1993, under newly appointed CEO Harvey Golub, American Express began to divest itself of its banking and brokerage operations. [S75] It sold its retail brokerage and asset management operations to Primerica and in 1994 it spun off Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in an initial public offering, as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. [S76] After being spun off, Dick Fuld became CEO of the company. [S77] Fuld steered Lehman through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and when the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund collapsed in 1998. [S78] In 2001, the firm acquired the private-client services, or \"PCS\", business of Cowen & Co. [S79] and later, in 2003, aggressively re-entered the asset-management business, which it had exited in 1989. [S80] Beginning with $2 billion in assets under management, the firm acquired the Crossroads Group, the fixed-income division of Lincoln Capital Management and Neuberger Berman. [S81] These businesses, together with the PCS business and Lehman's private-equity business, comprised the Investment Management Division, which generated approximately $3.1 billion in net revenue. [S82] During the subprime mortgage crisis, Fuld kept his job while CEOs of rivals like Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup were forced to resign. [S83] In addition, Lehman's board of directors, which included retired CEOs like Vodafone's Christopher Gent and IBM's John Akers were reluctant to challenge Fuld as the firm's share price spiraled lower. [S84] In May 2008, prior to going bankrupt, the firm had $639 billion in assets. [S85] ### Response to September 11, 2001 attacks\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Lehman occupied three floors (38\u201340) of 1 World Trade Center, where one of its employees was killed in the terrorist attacks of that day. [S86] Its global headquarters in Three World Financial Center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris, displacing over 6,500 employees. [S87] Trading operations moved to Jersey City, New Jersey. [S88] When stock markets reopened on September 17, 2001, Lehman's sales and trading capabilities were restored. [S89] In the ensuing months, the firm spread its operations across New York City in over 40 temporary locations. [S90] The investment-banking division converted the first-floor lounges, restaurants, and all 665 guest rooms of the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel into office space.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the post-bankruptcy liquidation and administrative processes of Lehman Brothers reflected the scale of its financial obligations, and what role settlements with entities like JPMorgan played.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several key points. For the liquidation and administrative processes, there's a lot about the amounts paid to creditors. For example, \"As of January 2016, Lehman paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors.\" Then there's the part about the brokerage unit liquidating in 2022 after paying over $115 billion over 14 years. Also, the British operations were being administered by PricewaterhouseCoopers, expected to finish by 2025. These figures show the massive scale of their obligations.\n\nRegarding JPMorgan's role, the passage states that JPMorgan paid $1.42 billion to settle a lawsuit accusing them of draining Lehman's liquidity before the crash. Additionally, the settlement allowed another $1.496 billion to creditors and a $76 million deposit. This indicates that settlements were a significant part of the process, helping to distribute funds to creditors.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. The $105 billion and $115 billion figures are from S212 and S215. The JPMorgan settlement details are in S213 and S214. The PricewaterhouseCoopers part is S216. Also, the $639 billion in assets before bankruptcy is S85, but that's more about pre-bankruptcy size. The user is focused on post-bankruptcy, so maybe that's not needed here. Let me check the question again. It's about the liquidation and administrative processes, so the key citations are the ones mentioning the payments and the administration timeline. The JPMorgan settlements are directly relevant. I should structure the answer with each relevant sentence and their citations."

[S118] Lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space \"necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space.\"\n\nIn September 2007, Joe Gregory appointed Erin Callan as CFO. [S119] On March 16, 2008, after rival Bear Stearns was taken over by JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale, market analysts suggested that Lehman would be the next major investment bank to fall. [S120] Callan fielded Lehman's first quarter conference call, where the firm posted a profit of $48.9 million, compared to Citigroup's $5.1 billion and Merrill Lynch's $1.97 billion losses which was Lehman's 55th consecutive profitable quarter. [S121] The firm's stock price leapt 46 percent after that announcement. [S122] In 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis. [S123] Lehman's loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages; it is unclear whether Lehman was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds or voluntarily kept them. [S124] In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008.

[S129] As a result, there was major management shakeup, in which Hugh \"Skip\" McGee III (head of investment banking) held a meeting with senior staff to strip CEO Richard Fuld and his lieutenants of their authority. [S130] Consequently, Joe Gregory agreed to resign as president and COO, and afterward he told Erin Callan that she had to resign as CFO.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the subprime mortgage crisis impacted Lehman Brothers' financial performance and what the consequences were for their leadership structure.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts. Let me start with Passage 2 since it mentions the subprime mortgage crisis more directly.\n\nLooking at the sentences in Passage 2, there's a lot about Lehman's losses due to subprime mortgages. For example, [S123] says Lehman faced an unprecedented loss in 2008 because of the subprime crisis. [S124] explains that they held large positions in subprime and lower-rated mortgage tranches, leading to huge losses. [S125] mentions huge losses in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities in 2008. Then [S126] states that in the second fiscal quarter, they reported $2.8 billion in losses and had to sell $6 billion in assets. [S127] notes that Lehman stock lost 73% of its value in the first half of 2008. [S128] mentions the $2.8 billion second-quarter loss and that hedges were ineffective. [S129] says they raised $6 billion in capital. \n\nSo, the financial impact includes massive losses, asset sales, and a drastic drop in stock value. Now, the consequences for leadership. [S130] talks about a major management shakeup where Hugh McGee III met with senior staff to strip CEO Richard Fuld and his team of authority. [S131] says Joe Gregory agreed to resign as president and COO, and then told Erin Callan to resign as CFO. [S132] mentions Callan was CFO for six months before leaving after Gregory was demoted. [S133] states Bart McDade was named to replace Gregory. [S134] says McDade brought back Gelband and Kirk who were previously pushed out by Gregory. [S135] notes Fuld remained CEO but became isolated from McDade's team. \n\nSo the leadership changes included Gregory and Callan leaving, McDade taking over, and Fuld being isolated. \n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should be in <statement> tags with citations in <cite> if applicable. \n\nFirst statement: The subprime mortgage crisis led to significant financial losses for Lehman Brothers. Cite [S123][S124][S125][S126][S127][S128]. \n\nSecond statement: The firm had to sell assets and raise capital. Cite [S126][S129]. \n\nThird statement: Leadership changes occurred, including the resignation of key executives. Cite [S130][S131][S132][S133][S135]. \n\nWait, need to check each part. Also, make sure each sentence is a separate statement. Let me make sure each statement is a single sentence. For example, the first part about financial impact can be split into multiple sentences if needed. But the user's example shows each sentence as a separate statement. So maybe break down each point into individual statements.\n\nAlso, check if all citations are correctly attributed. For example, the stock loss of 73% is [S127], the management shakeup is [S130], etc.\n\nI need to ensure that each statement is concise and properly cited. Let me draft each statement step by step."

[S191] The transaction was expected to close in early 2009, subject to approval by the U.S. [S192] Bankruptcy Court, but a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction on December 3, 2008.

[S197] Immediately following the bankruptcy filing, an already distressed financial market began a period of extreme volatility, during which the Dow experienced its largest one day point loss, largest intra-day range (more than 1,000 points) and largest daily point gain. [S198] What followed was what many have called the \"perfect storm\" of economic distress factors and eventually a $700bn bailout package (Troubled Asset Relief Program) prepared by Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and approved by Congress. [S199] The Dow eventually closed at a new six-year low of 7,552.29 on November 20, followed by a further drop to 6626 by March of the next year. [S200] The fall of Lehman also had a strong effect on small private investors such as bond holders and holders of so-called minibonds. [S201] In Germany, structured products, often based on an index, were sold mostly to private investors, elderly, retired persons, students and families. [S202] Most of those now worthless derivatives were sold by the German arm of Citigroup, the German Citibank now owned by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n### Ongoing litigation\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Lehman Brothers\n\n\n# Lehman Brothers\n\n\n\n**Lehman Brothers Inc.** (/\u02c8li\u02d0m\u0259n/ LEE-m\u0259n) was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. [S2] Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. [S3] It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. [S4] Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. [S5] Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008. [S6] On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. [S7] The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. [S8] Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S9] The market collapse also gave support to the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. [S10] After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted. [S11] The following day, major British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, a significant and controlling interest in Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions, along with its New York headquarters building. [S12] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. [S13] Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. [S14] Peck. [S15] The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. [S16] The deal became effective on October 13, 2008. [S17] ## History\n\n\n### Under the Lehman family (1850\u20131969)\n\nIn 1844, 23-year-old Hayum Lehmann, who changed his name to Henry Lehman, the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from Rimpar, Bavaria. [S18] He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a dry-goods store, \"H. [S19] Lehman\". [S20] In 1847, following the arrival of his brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became \"H. [S21] Lehman and Bro.\" With the arrival of their youngest brother, Mayer Lehman, in 1850, the firm changed its name again and \"Lehman Brothers\" was founded. [S22] During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama's highest-grossing cash crop. [S23] Until the U.S. [S24] Civil War, nearly all U.S. [S25] cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama's total population. [S26] Mayer Lehman was listed as the owner of seven slaves (\"three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50\") in the U.S. [S27] Census of 1860. [S28] Capitalizing on cotton's high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from slave plantations as payment for merchandise, eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. [S29] Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. [S30] Following Henry's death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations.",

[S187] It would not take on any trading assets or liabilities in the European units. [S188] Nomura negotiated such a low price because it acquired only Lehman's employees in the regions, and not its stocks, bonds or other assets. [S189] The last Lehman Brothers Annual Report identified that these non-US subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced. [S190] #### Sale of asset management businesses\n\nOn September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell Neuberger Berman, part of its investment management business, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman, for $2.15\u00a0billion. [S191] The transaction was expected to close in early 2009, subject to approval by the U.S. [S192] Bankruptcy Court, but a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction on December 3, 2008. [S193] Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. [S194] retain a 49% common equity interest in the firm, now known as Neuberger Berman Group LLC. [S195] In Europe, the Quantitative Asset Management Business has been acquired back by its employees on November 13, 2008 and has been renamed back to TOBAM. [S196] ### Financial fallout\n\nLehman's bankruptcy was the largest failure of an investment bank since Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed in 1990 amid fraud allegations. [S197] Immediately following the bankruptcy filing, an already distressed financial market began a period of extreme volatility, during which the Dow experienced its largest one day point loss, largest intra-day range (more than 1,000 points) and largest daily point gain. [S198] What followed was what many have called the \"perfect storm\" of economic distress factors and eventually a $700bn bailout package (Troubled Asset Relief Program) prepared by Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and approved by Congress. [S199] The Dow eventually closed at a new six-year low of 7,552.29 on November 20, followed by a further drop to 6626 by March of the next year. [S200] The fall of Lehman also had a strong effect on small private investors such as bond holders and holders of so-called minibonds. [S201] In Germany, structured products, often based on an index, were sold mostly to private investors, elderly, retired persons, students and families. [S202] Most of those now worthless derivatives were sold by the German arm of Citigroup, the German Citibank now owned by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n### Ongoing litigation",
        "[S1] Lehman Brothers\n\n\n# Lehman Brothers\n\n\n\n**Lehman Brothers Inc.** (/\u02c8li\u02d0m\u0259n/ LEE-m\u0259n) was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. [S2] Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. [S3] It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. [S4] Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. [S5] Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008. [S6] On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. [S7] The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. [S8] Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S9] The market collapse also gave support to the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. [S10] After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted. [S11] The following day, major British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, a significant and controlling interest in Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions, along with its New York headquarters building. [S12] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. [S13] Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. [S14] Peck. [S15] The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. [S16] The deal became effective on October 13, 2008. [S17] ## History\n\n\n### Under the Lehman family (1850\u20131969)\n\nIn 1844, 23-year-old Hayum Lehmann, who changed his name to Henry Lehman, the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from Rimpar, Bavaria. [S18] He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a dry-goods store, \"H. [S19] Lehman\". [S20] In 1847, following the arrival of his brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became \"H. [S21] Lehman and Bro.\" With the arrival of their youngest brother, Mayer Lehman, in 1850, the firm changed its name again and \"Lehman Brothers\" was founded. [S22] During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama's highest-grossing cash crop. [S23] Until the U.S. [S24] Civil War, nearly all U.S. [S25] cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama's total population. [S26] Mayer Lehman was listed as the owner of seven slaves (\"three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50\") in the U.S. [S27] Census of 1860. [S28] Capitalizing on cotton's high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from slave plantations as payment for merchandise, eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. [S29] Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. [S30] Following Henry's death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key financial consequences of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and how the sale of its asset management businesses impacted its creditors. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the passage for mentions of financial consequences. The section titled \"Financial fallout\" seems important. It mentions that Lehman's bankruptcy was the largest failure of an investment bank since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990. Then there's talk about the financial market becoming extremely volatile, with the Dow experiencing huge swings. The \"perfect storm\" leading to the $700bn TARP bailout is also noted. Additionally, the Dow closed at a new six-year low, and there were impacts on small investors and minibonds, especially in Germany. These points can be cited from sentences [S197] to [S202].\n\nNext, the sale of asset management businesses. The \"Sale of asset management businesses\" section mentions that Lehman sold Neuberger Berman to Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman for $2.15 billion, but there was a competing bid by the firm's management. Creditors retained a 49% equity interest in the new firm. Also, the European Quantitative Asset Management Business was bought back by employees and renamed TOBAM. These details are in [S191] to [S196].\n\nFor the impact on creditors, the sale of these businesses might have provided some assets to creditors, but the context doesn't explicitly state how this affected them. However, the fact that creditors retained a 49% stake could mean they received some value. The overall financial fallout, like the market crash and bailout, would have affected creditors indirectly. The Barclays deal involved transferring assets and liabilities, which might have relieved some burdens but also left Lehman with retained assets. The exact impact on creditors isn't detailed beyond the equity stake, so I need to stick to what's cited.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement and proper citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite> as per the format. Avoid any markdown and keep it natural."

[S92] In October 2001, Lehman purchased a 32-story, 1,050,000-square-foot (98,000\u00a0m\u00b2) office building for a reported sum of $700 million. [S93] The building, located at 745 Seventh Avenue, had recently been completed, and not yet occupied, by rival Morgan Stanley. [S94] Lehman began moving into the new facility in January and finished in March 2002. [S95] The firm did not return to Three World Financial Center as its structural integrity had not been given a clean bill of health, and the company could not have waited for repairs to Three World Financial Center to conclude. [S96] After the attacks, Lehman's management placed increased emphasis on business continuity planning. [S97] Aside from its headquarters in Three World Financial Center, Lehman maintained operations-and-backoffice facilities in Jersey City, space that the firm considered leaving prior to 9/11. [S98] The space was not only retained, but expanded, including the construction of a backup-trading facility. [S99] ### June 2003 SEC litigation\n\nIn June 2003, the company was one of ten firms which simultaneously entered into a settlement with the U.S. [S100] Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office of the New York State Attorney General and various other securities regulators, regarding undue influence over each firm's research analysts by its investment-banking divisions. [S101] Regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated analyst compensation with the firms' investment-banking revenues, and promised favorable, market-moving research coverage, in exchange for underwriting opportunities. [S102] The settlement, known as the \"global settlement\", provided for total financial penalties of $1.4 billion, including $80 million against Lehman, and structural reforms including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments, no analyst compensation, directly or indirectly, from investment-banking revenues, and the provision of free, independent, third-party, research to the firms' clients. [S103] ## Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)\n\nLehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of mortgage origination. [S104] In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender, Aurora Loan Services (not a bank), an Alt-A lender. [S105] In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. [S106] Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. [S107] By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending. [S108] By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. [S109] By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month. [S110] By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. [S111] From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. [S112] In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital. [S113] ## Collapse\n\n\n### Causes\n\n\n#### Malfeasance\n\nA March 2010 report by the court appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. [S114] This practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the company's balance sheet. [S115] However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created \"a materially misleading picture of the firm's financial condition in late 2007 and 2008\". [S116] #### Subprime mortgage crisis\n\nPassage 2:\n[S31] By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to New York City, where factors and commission houses were based. [S32] Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 Liberty Street, and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office. [S33] In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the Civil War, the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr & Co. [S34] Following the war the company helped finance Alabama's reconstruction. [S35] The firm's headquarters was eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the New York Cotton Exchange in 1870, commodifying the crop; Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. [S36] The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business. [S37] Lehman became a member of the Coffee Exchange as early as 1883 and finally the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. [S38] In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company. [S39] Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. [S40] In that year, under Emanuel's son Philip Lehman, the firm partnered with Goldman, Sachs & Co., to bring the General Cigar Co. [S41] to market, followed closely by Sears, Roebuck and Company. [S42] Among these were F.W. [S43] Woolworth Company, May Department Stores Company, Gimbel Brothers, Inc., R.H. [S44] Macy & Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. [S45] Goodrich Co., and Endicott Johnson Corporation. [S46] Following Philip Lehman's retirement in 1925, his son Robert \"Bobbie\" Lehman took over as head of the firm. [S47] During Bobbie's tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the Great Depression by focusing on venture capital while the equities market recovered. [S48] In 1924, John M. [S49] Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm, followed by Monroe C. [S50] Gutman and Paul Mazur, who became partners in 1927. [S51] By 1928, the firm had moved to its One William Street location. [S52] In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the initial public offering of the first television manufacturer, DuMont Laboratories, and helped fund the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). [S53] It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies Halliburton and Kerr-McGee. [S54] In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of Digital Equipment Corporation. [S55] Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by Compaq. [S56] ### An evolving partnership (1969\u20131984)\n\nRobert Lehman died in 1969 after 44 years in a leadership position for the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership. [S57] At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. [S58] By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, Pete Peterson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bell & Howell Corporation, was brought in to save the firm. [S59] Under Peterson's leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham & Co. [S60] in 1975, and two years later merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., the country's fourth-largest investment bank, behind Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and First Boston. [S61] Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry. [S62] By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm's investment bankers and traders prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. [S63] Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman's management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the relationship between the 2003 SEC litigation and Lehman Brothers' later financial practices, as well as the specific penalties imposed.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the June 2003 SEC litigation in sentences S99 to S103. Let me check those. \n\nIn S99, it starts with \"June 2003 SEC litigation\" and then in S100, it says Lehman was one of ten firms in a settlement with the SEC, NY State Attorney General, and others. The regulators alleged that the firms had improper influence over research analysts by investment-banking divisions. The settlement included $1.4 billion in penalties, with $80 million against Lehman. The structural reforms mentioned are separation of investment banking and research departments, no analyst compensation from investment-banking revenues, and providing free, independent research to clients.\n\nNow, how does this relate to later financial practices? The passage later talks about Lehman's rise in mortgage origination and their highly leveraged structure leading to collapse. The 2003 reforms might have been intended to prevent conflicts of interest, but Lehman's later practices, like the subprime mortgage crisis and accounting gimmicks, might indicate that these reforms weren't sufficient or were circumvented. However, the context doesn't explicitly state this connection. The user is asking for the relation, so I need to check if there's any mention of how the 2003 reforms affected later practices. \n\nLooking through the rest of the passage, there's a section on the collapse, mentioning cosmetic accounting and the subprime crisis. But there's no direct link between the 2003 litigation and these later issues. The answer would need to state that the litigation led to structural reforms but doesn't explicitly connect them to the later practices. However, the user might infer that the reforms didn't prevent the collapse, but since the context doesn't say that, I can't assume it. \n\nSo the answer should mention the penalties (S100-S103) and the structural reforms (S102). The relation part would be that the reforms were intended to address conflicts of interest, but the passage doesn't explicitly state how that relates to later practices. However, the user might expect that the later financial practices (like subprime and leverage) were separate issues, but the context doesn't make that connection. Therefore, the answer should stick to the given info: the penalties and reforms from the 2003 litigation, and note that later practices are discussed but without a direct link provided."

[S97] Aside from its headquarters in Three World Financial Center, Lehman maintained operations-and-backoffice facilities in Jersey City, space that the firm considered leaving prior to 9/11. [S98] The space was not only retained, but expanded, including the construction of a backup-trading facility. [S99] ### June 2003 SEC litigation\n\nIn June 2003, the company was one of ten firms which simultaneously entered into a settlement with the U.S. [S100] Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office of the New York State Attorney General and various other securities regulators, regarding undue influence over each firm's research analysts by its investment-banking divisions. [S101] Regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated analyst compensation with the firms' investment-banking revenues, and promised favorable, market-moving research coverage, in exchange for underwriting opportunities. [S102] The settlement, known as the \"global settlement\", provided for total financial penalties of $1.4 billion, including $80 million against Lehman, and structural reforms including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments, no analyst compensation, directly or indirectly, from investment-banking revenues, and the provision of free, independent, third-party, research to the firms' clients. [S103] ## Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)\n\nLehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of mortgage origination. [S104] In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender, Aurora Loan Services (not a bank), an Alt-A lender. [S105] In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. [S106] Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. [S107] By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending. [S108] By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. [S109] By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month. [S110] By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. [S111] From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. [S112] In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital. [S113] ## Collapse\n\n\n### Causes\n\n\n#### Malfeasance\n\nA March 2010 report by the court appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. [S114] This practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the company's balance sheet. [S115] However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created \"a materially misleading picture of the firm's financial condition in late 2007 and 2008\". [S116] #### Subprime mortgage crisis\n\nPassage 2:\n[S31] By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to New York City, where factors and commission houses were based. [S32] Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 Liberty Street, and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office. [S33] In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the Civil War, the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr & Co. [S34] Following the war the company helped finance Alabama's reconstruction. [S35] The firm's headquarters was eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the New York Cotton Exchange in 1870, commodifying the crop; Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. [S36] The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business. [S37] Lehman became a member of the Coffee Exchange as early as 1883 and finally the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. [S38] In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company. [S39] Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. [S40] In that year, under Emanuel's son Philip Lehman, the firm partnered with Goldman, Sachs & Co., to bring the General Cigar Co. [S41] to market, followed closely by Sears, Roebuck and Company. [S42] Among these were F.W. [S43] Woolworth Company, May Department Stores Company, Gimbel Brothers, Inc., R.H. [S44] Macy & Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. [S45] Goodrich Co., and Endicott Johnson Corporation. [S46] Following Philip Lehman's retirement in 1925, his son Robert \"Bobbie\" Lehman took over as head of the firm. [S47] During Bobbie's tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the Great Depression by focusing on venture capital while the equities market recovered. [S48] In 1924, John M. [S49] Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm, followed by Monroe C. [S50] Gutman and Paul Mazur, who became partners in 1927. [S51] By 1928, the firm had moved to its One William Street location. [S52] In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the initial public offering of the first television manufacturer, DuMont Laboratories, and helped fund the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). [S53] It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies Halliburton and Kerr-McGee. [S54] In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of Digital Equipment Corporation. [S55] Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by Compaq. [S56] ### An evolving partnership (1969\u20131984)\n\nRobert Lehman died in 1969 after 44 years in a leadership position for the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership. [S57] At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. [S58] By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, Pete Peterson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bell & Howell Corporation, was brought in to save the firm. [S59] Under Peterson's leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham & Co. [S60] in 1975, and two years later merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., the country's fourth-largest investment bank, behind Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and First Boston. [S61] Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry. [S62] By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm's investment bankers and traders prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. [S63] Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman's management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the operational changes Lehman Brothers implemented after 9/11 and how these reflected their response to the attacks and broader business continuity needs.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions several points. Let me scan through the sentences again. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a lot about post-9/11 changes. Sentence S91 talks about flextime and remote work via VPN. Then S92 mentions purchasing a new office building in October 2001. S95 explains they didn't return to Three World Financial Center because of structural issues. S96 says management emphasized business continuity planning. S97 and S98 mention retaining and expanding operations in Jersey City, including a backup-trading facility. \n\nSo the key points here are flextime/remote work, moving to a new office building, not returning to the damaged Three World Financial Center, increased business continuity planning, and expanding facilities in Jersey City. \n\nI need to make sure these are all cited correctly. The user wants each sentence in the answer with citations. Also, the answer should be in the specified format with <statement> tags and <cite> for each. \n\nWait, the question also asks how these changes reflected their response to the attacks and business continuity. So I need to connect each operational change to that context. For example, the new office building and not returning to the damaged site is directly related to the attacks. The business continuity planning and backup facilities would be part of broader needs. \n\nI should structure each statement to include the change and the citation. Let me check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. The rest of the passage talks about later events like the SEC litigation and mortgage origination, which don't relate to 9/11. So focus on the first part of Passage 1.\n\nNow, compiling the answer. Each operational change as a separate statement with citations. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered. For example, flextime and remote work is S91. The new office building is S92. Not returning to Three World Financial Center is S95. Business continuity planning is S96. Retaining and expanding Jersey City is S97 and S98. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate <statement> tag. Also, check that the citations are in the correct format [Sx]. No markdown, just the tags. Alright, that should cover it."

[S113] ## Collapse\n\n\n### Causes\n\n\n#### Malfeasance\n\nA March 2010 report by the court appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. [S114] This practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the company's balance sheet. [S115] However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created \"a materially misleading picture of the firm's financial condition in late 2007 and 2008\". [S116] #### Subprime mortgage crisis",
        "[S31] By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to New York City, where factors and commission houses were based. [S32] Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 Liberty Street, and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office. [S33] In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the Civil War, the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr & Co. [S34] Following the war the company helped finance Alabama's reconstruction. [S35] The firm's headquarters was eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the New York Cotton Exchange in 1870, commodifying the crop; Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. [S36] The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business. [S37] Lehman became a member of the Coffee Exchange as early as 1883 and finally the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. [S38] In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company. [S39] Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. [S40] In that year, under Emanuel's son Philip Lehman, the firm partnered with Goldman, Sachs & Co., to bring the General Cigar Co. [S41] to market, followed closely by Sears, Roebuck and Company. [S42] Among these were F.W. [S43] Woolworth Company, May Department Stores Company, Gimbel Brothers, Inc., R.H. [S44] Macy & Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. [S45] Goodrich Co., and Endicott Johnson Corporation. [S46] Following Philip Lehman's retirement in 1925, his son Robert \"Bobbie\" Lehman took over as head of the firm. [S47] During Bobbie's tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the Great Depression by focusing on venture capital while the equities market recovered. [S48] In 1924, John M. [S49] Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm, followed by Monroe C. [S50] Gutman and Paul Mazur, who became partners in 1927. [S51] By 1928, the firm had moved to its One William Street location. [S52] In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the initial public offering of the first television manufacturer, DuMont Laboratories, and helped fund the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). [S53] It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies Halliburton and Kerr-McGee. [S54] In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of Digital Equipment Corporation. [S55] Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by Compaq. [S56] ### An evolving partnership (1969\u20131984)\n\nRobert Lehman died in 1969 after 44 years in a leadership position for the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership. [S57] At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. [S58] By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, Pete Peterson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bell & Howell Corporation, was brought in to save the firm. [S59] Under Peterson's leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham & Co. [S60] in 1975, and two years later merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., the country's fourth-largest investment bank, behind Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and First Boston. [S61] Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry. [S62] By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm's investment bankers and traders prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. [S63] Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman's management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of subprime mortgage origination in Lehman Brothers' financial trajectory and how this activity scaled over time. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passages for mentions of subprime mortgages. In Passage 1, there's a section titled \"Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)\" which seems relevant. Let me check those sentences. \n\n[S104] says Lehman was one of the first to move into mortgage origination. Then [S105] mentions buying Aurora Loan Services in 1997, which is an Alt-A lender. [S106] states they purchased BNC Mortgage LLC in 2000, a subprime lender. [S107] notes they became a force in the subprime market. \n\nThe scaling over time is covered in [S108] where by 2003 they made $18.2 billion in loans, third in lending. [S109] says it topped $40 billion by 2004. [S110] mentions Aurora and BNC lending almost $50 billion monthly by 2006. \n\nAlso, [S111] talks about Lehman's assets in 2008 being $680 billion with only $22.5 billion in capital, highlighting the leverage. [S112] mentions risky commercial real estate holdings thirty times capital, and [S113] states a 3-5% decline would wipe out capital. This shows the risk from their mortgage activities.\n\nThe subprime mortgage crisis section in Passage 1 [S114]-[S116] discusses accounting practices, but the question is about the role and scaling, so maybe those are more about the collapse. The user also asked how the activity scaled, so the growth figures from 2003 to 2006 are key.\n\nI need to structure the answer with the role (entering subprime, becoming a major player, leveraging heavily) and the scaling (growth in loan amounts over the years). Citations would be [S104][S105][S106][S107][S108][S109][S110][S111][S112][S113]. Wait, but each sentence needs its own citations. Let me check each sentence in the relevant paragraphs.\n\nThe sentence about being first in mortgage origination is [S104]. The purchases of Aurora and BNC are [S105] and [S106]. Becoming a force in subprime is [S107]. The 2003 loans [S108], 2004 [S109], 2006 [S110]. The 2008 assets [S111], risky holdings [S112], and the 3-5% decline [S113]. \n\nSo each of these points should be separate statements with their respective citations. Need to make sure each statement is a separate <statement> tag with the correct citations. Also, check if any other parts of the context mention subprime. Passage 2 seems to be about the history before the subprime era, so probably not relevant here. \n\nSo the answer should outline that subprime mortgage origination was a key part of Lehman's strategy, starting in the late 90s, expanding through acquisitions, leading to significant growth in loans, and increasing leverage which contributed to their collapse. Each fact needs to be a separate statement with citations."

[S2] Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. [S3] It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. [S4] Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. [S5] Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008. [S6] On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. [S7] The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. [S8] Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S9] The market collapse also gave support to the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. [S10] After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted. [S11] The following day, major British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, a significant and controlling interest in Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions, along with its New York headquarters building. [S12] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. [S13] Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. [S14] Peck. [S15] The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. [S16] The deal became effective on October 13, 2008. [S17] ## History\n\n\n### Under the Lehman family (1850\u20131969)\n\nIn 1844, 23-year-old Hayum Lehmann, who changed his name to Henry Lehman, the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from Rimpar, Bavaria. [S18] He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a dry-goods store, \"H. [S19] Lehman\". [S20] In 1847, following the arrival of his brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became \"H. [S21] Lehman and Bro.\" With the arrival of their youngest brother, Mayer Lehman, in 1850, the firm changed its name again and \"Lehman Brothers\" was founded. [S22] During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama's highest-grossing cash crop. [S23] Until the U.S. [S24] Civil War, nearly all U.S. [S25] cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama's total population. [S26] Mayer Lehman was listed as the owner of seven slaves (\"three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50\") in the U.S. [S27] Census of 1860. [S28] Capitalizing on cotton's high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from slave plantations as payment for merchandise, eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. [S29] Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. [S30] Following Henry's death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the legal and financial arrangements after Lehman's bankruptcy, specifically the creditors' committee's stance and the sale of real estate assets, affected the firm's restructuring. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the creditors' committee. In Passage 1, there's a quote from Luc Despins, part of the creditors' committee. He mentions they didn't object because there was no viable alternative and they didn't have enough time to review the transaction. That probably influenced the restructuring by not opposing the deal, allowing it to proceed. That's probably relevant.\n\nThen, looking at the sale of real estate assets. There's a part where Lehman's attorney mentions the purchase price for real estate components, like the New York headquarters and data centers. The original estimate vs. the appraisal value is mentioned. Also, Barclays taking over some assets but not others. The sale of real estate would impact the restructuring by transferring assets to Barclays and retaining some securities. \n\nThe sale of asset management businesses, like Neuberger Berman, is also part of the financial arrangements. The creditors retaining a 49% interest and the sale to private equity firms. That affects restructuring by transferring parts of the business. \n\nThe financial fallout section mentions the largest bankruptcy, market volatility, and the TARP bailout. But the question is about the specific arrangements like creditors' committee and real estate sales. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's info about the bankruptcy filing and the sale to Barclays. The revised agreement approved by the court. The sale of assets to Nomura in Asia and Europe. The retention of some assets by Lehman, like $20 billion in securities. \n\nSo, putting this together: The creditors' committee's lack of objection allowed the sale to Barclays, which included real estate and other assets. The sale of real estate assets (like the headquarters) to Barclays at a lower appraisal value might have affected the restructuring by transferring those assets, possibly impacting Lehman's remaining liabilities. The retention of some assets and liabilities by Lehman would also influence the restructuring. \n\nI need to make sure each statement cites the correct sentences. For example, the creditors' committee's stance is in S179 and S180. The real estate sale details are in S182, S183, S184, S185, S186. The sale to Nomura is S186-S189. The asset management sale is S191-S195. \n\nWait, the user specifically asked about creditors' committee and real estate assets. So focus on those. The answer should connect the committee's stance (not objecting) allowing the transaction, and the sale of real estate affecting the restructuring by transferring assets and liabilities. Also, the appraisal values might have impacted the financial arrangements.\n\nNeed to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is a separate <statement> with citations. Avoid adding extra info not in the context."

[S66] Schwarzman, chairman of the firm's M&A committee, recalled in a February 2003 interview with *Private Equity International* that \"Lehman Brothers had an extremely competitive internal environment, which ultimately became dysfunctional.\" The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm. [S67] ### Merger with American Express (1984\u20131994)\n\nShearson/American Express, an American Express-owned securities company focused on brokerage rather than investment banking, acquired Lehman in 1984, for $360\u00a0million.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key financial and legal consequences of Lehman Brothers' collapse, and how these relate to the company's historical mergers, leadership, and post-bankruptcy processes. I need to look through the provided passages and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the supporting context for mentions of financial consequences. In Passage 1, there's a lot about the repo 105 accounting practice, which involved $50 billion. That's a major financial point. Then there's the part about the SEC not being confident in proving legal violations, which relates to legal consequences. The settlements with JPMorgan and the payments to creditors are also financial. The liquidation process and the pension fund issues are part of the financial aftermath.\n\nNext, legal consequences. The report mentions Ernst & Young and Richard Fuld possibly facing charges. The SEC's stance is important here. Also, the court order for the pension plan and the appeal loss are legal aspects. The $105 billion paid to unsecured creditors and the JPMorgan settlement are financial but might have legal implications.\n\nNow, relating these to historical mergers. Passage 2 talks about the merger with American Express in 1984, which might have influenced the company's structure. The divestment in 1994 and the leadership changes, like Dick Fuld becoming CEO, could be linked. The subprime mortgage crisis and Fuld's leadership during that time are key. The mergers and acquisitions history might have contributed to the company's risk-taking, leading to the collapse.\n\nPost-bankruptcy administrative processes: The liquidation of the brokerage unit in 2022, the administration by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the ongoing processes until 2025. Also, the pension fund issues and the settlements with JPMorgan are part of the administrative processes.\n\nI need to make sure each point is cited correctly. For example, the repo 105 is in S205, the SEC's statement in S209, the pension fund in S210, the payments to creditors in S212, JPMorgan's settlement in S213 and S214, and the liquidation in S215. The mergers section in Passage 2 has the American Express merger (S68), the divestment (S75), and Fuld's leadership (S77). The post-bankruptcy admin processes are in S215, S216, and S217.\n\nI should structure the answer by separating financial and legal consequences, then link them to mergers, leadership, and post-bankruptcy processes. Each statement needs to have the correct citations. Also, check if all the relevant parts are covered and that the citations match the sentences."

        "[S203] On March 11, 2010, Anton R. [S204] Valukas, a court-appointed examiner, published the results of its year-long investigation into the finances of Lehman Brothers. [S205] This report revealed that Lehman Brothers used an accounting procedure termed repo 105 to temporarily exchange $50\u00a0billion of assets into cash just before publishing its financial statements. [S206] The action could be seen to implicate both Ernst & Young, the bank's accountancy firm and Richard S. [S207] Fuld, Jr, the former CEO. [S208] This could potentially lead to Ernst & Young being found guilty of financial malpractice and Fuld facing time in prison. [S209] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, in March 2011, the SEC announced that they weren't confident that they could prove that Lehman Brothers violated US laws in its accounting practices. [S210] In October 2011, the administrators of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. [S211] lost their appeal to overturn a court order forcing them to pay \u00a3148 million into their underfunded pensions plan. [S212] As of January 2016, Lehman paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors. [S213] In addition, JPMorgan will pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of draining Lehman Brothers liquidity right before the crash. [S214] The settlement would permit another $1.496 billion to be paid to creditors and a separate $76 million deposit. [S215] The brokerage unit of Lehman Brothers completed its liquidation process on September 28, 2022, after paying out over $115 billion to its customers and creditors over the course of 14 years. [S216] As of December 2022, Lehman's British operations were being administrated by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which expected to complete the administration process no earlier than 2025.

[S220] Freidheim\n* Rodger Krouse (born 1961)\n* Jack Langer (born 1948/1949), basketball player and investment banker\n* Bart McDade\n* Hugh McGee\n* George Herbert Walker IV\n* Frederick M. [S221] Warburg\n* Joseph Rosenberg\n\n## In popular culture\n\nThe events of the weekend leading up to Lehman's bankruptcy are dramatized in the 2009 BBC television film *The Last Days of Lehman Brothers*. [S222] In the 2010 animated film *Despicable Me*, the main character Gru visits the Bank of Evil, which funds all evil plots for villains around the world and has a sign reading \"Formerly Lehman Brothers\". [S223] The 2011 drama film *Margin Call* focuses on the events of a 24-hour period at a large investment bank based on an amalgam of investment banks, drawing heavily from the culture of Lehman Brothers. [S224] However, the events in the film are primarily a depiction of the actions of Goldman Sachs. [S225] The 2011 HBO film *Too Big to Fail* recounts the days before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the fallout afterward. [S226] The 2011 film *Horrible Bosses* features a character by the name of Kenny Sommerfield (played by P. [S227] J. [S228] Byrne) who worked at Lehman Brothers until its bankruptcy, ending up broke. [S229] The fall of Lehman Brothers is depicted in the 2015 film *The Big Short*, where two of the characters walk around the Lehman Brothers offices after the bankruptcy to see the main trading floor. [S230] In Imbolo Mbue's 2016 debut novel *Behold the Dreamers*, an immigrant from Cameroon is a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers. [S231] In the 2016 animated film *Zootopia*, there is a brief appearance of a bank called Lemming Brothers, which is staffed by lemmings. [S232] *The Lehman Trilogy* is a three-act play by Italian dramatist Stefano Massini about the history of the Lehman Brothers. [S233] In the 2019 Showtime comedy series *Black Monday*, a fictionalized version of Lehman Brothers with an altered spelling is central to the plot and represented by brothers Larry & Lenny Leighman. [S234] ## Principal locations (first year of occupancy)",
        "[S64] Upset bankers, who had soured over the power struggle, left the company. [S65] Stephen A. [S66] Schwarzman, chairman of the firm's M&A committee, recalled in a February 2003 interview with *Private Equity International* that \"Lehman Brothers had an extremely competitive internal environment, which ultimately became dysfunctional.\" The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm. [S67] ### Merger with American Express (1984\u20131994)\n\nShearson/American Express, an American Express-owned securities company focused on brokerage rather than investment banking, acquired Lehman in 1984, for $360\u00a0million. [S68] On May 11, the combined firms became Shearson Lehman/American Express. [S69] From 1983 to 1990, Peter A. [S70] Cohen was CEO and chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he led the $1 billion purchase of E.F. [S71] Hutton to form Shearson Lehman Hutton. [S72] In 1989, Shearson backed F. [S73] Ross Johnson's management team in its attempted management buyout of RJR Nabisco, but were ultimately outbid by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who was backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert. [S74] ### Divestment and independence (1994\u20132008)\n\nIn 1993, under newly appointed CEO Harvey Golub, American Express began to divest itself of its banking and brokerage operations. [S75] It sold its retail brokerage and asset management operations to Primerica and in 1994 it spun off Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in an initial public offering, as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. [S76] After being spun off, Dick Fuld became CEO of the company. [S77] Fuld steered Lehman through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and when the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund collapsed in 1998. [S78] In 2001, the firm acquired the private-client services, or \"PCS\", business of Cowen & Co. [S79] and later, in 2003, aggressively re-entered the asset-management business, which it had exited in 1989. [S80] Beginning with $2 billion in assets under management, the firm acquired the Crossroads Group, the fixed-income division of Lincoln Capital Management and Neuberger Berman. [S81] These businesses, together with the PCS business and Lehman's private-equity business, comprised the Investment Management Division, which generated approximately $3.1 billion in net revenue. [S82] During the subprime mortgage crisis, Fuld kept his job while CEOs of rivals like Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup were forced to resign. [S83] In addition, Lehman's board of directors, which included retired CEOs like Vodafone's Christopher Gent and IBM's John Akers were reluctant to challenge Fuld as the firm's share price spiraled lower. [S84] In May 2008, prior to going bankrupt, the firm had $639 billion in assets. [S85] ### Response to September 11, 2001 attacks\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Lehman occupied three floors (38\u201340) of 1 World Trade Center, where one of its employees was killed in the terrorist attacks of that day. [S86] Its global headquarters in Three World Financial Center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris, displacing over 6,500 employees. [S87] Trading operations moved to Jersey City, New Jersey. [S88] When stock markets reopened on September 17, 2001, Lehman's sales and trading capabilities were restored. [S89] In the ensuing months, the firm spread its operations across New York City in over 40 temporary locations. [S90] The investment-banking division converted the first-floor lounges, restaurants, and all 665 guest rooms of the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel into office space."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the 9/11 attacks impacted Lehman Brothers' operations and what role their restructuring and leadership played in their resilience or vulnerability during subsequent financial crises.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage has two main sections. Let me check each part.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Response to September 11, 2001 attacks\" with several citations. Specifically, [S86] mentions that Lehman occupied three floors in 1 World Trade Center, one employee was killed, and their global headquarters in Three World Financial Center were damaged. [S87] states that over 6,500 employees were displaced. Then [S88] says trading operations moved to Jersey City, and [S89] notes that sales and trading capabilities were restored when markets reopened. [S90] mentions spreading operations to over 40 temporary locations, including using the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel's spaces.\n\nSo, the 9/11 attacks caused physical damage to their headquarters, loss of an employee, displacement of many staff, and forced them to relocate operations. However, they managed to restore trading capabilities quickly and set up temporary locations, showing some resilience.\n\nNow, the second part of the question is about restructuring and leadership. In Passage 2, under \"Divestment and independence (1994\u20132008)\", [S77] mentions that Dick Fuld became CEO after the spin-off. [S78] says Fuld steered Lehman through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the 1998 LTCM collapse. [S83] notes that during the subprime crisis, Fuld kept his job while rivals' CEOs resigned. [S84] mentions the board was reluctant to challenge Fuld as the share price dropped. This suggests that Fuld's leadership was a factor in the company's actions, possibly contributing to vulnerabilities, as they didn't change leadership despite declining performance.\n\nAdditionally, the restructuring under Fuld included acquiring businesses like Cowen & Co's PCS and re-entering asset management, which might have been part of their strategy. However, the passage doesn't explicitly link these actions to resilience or vulnerability during subsequent crises, except that they survived longer than some competitors.\n\nSo, combining these points: 9/11 caused operational disruptions but Lehman adapted. Leadership under Fuld was persistent, which might have contributed to both resilience (continuing operations) and vulnerability (not addressing underlying issues leading to their collapse later).\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly referenced. The 9/11 impact is covered in [S86]-[S90]. The restructuring and leadership aspects are in [S77], [S78], [S83], [S84]. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its own citations. For example, the impact of 9/11 would cite [S86][S87][S88][S89][S90]. The leadership part would cite [S77][S78][S83][S84]. Need to check if any other sentences are relevant. The passage also mentions the merger with American Express and other events, but those might not be directly related to 9/11 or the subsequent crises. \n\nI think that's all. Now, formulating the answer with proper citations."

[S208] talks about potential legal consequences for both the accountancy firm and Fuld, indicating legal challenges. \n\nAlso, [S209] mentions the SEC's uncertainty about proving accounting law violations, which is a legal aspect. However, the question specifically asks about the subprime mortgage crisis. The subprime crisis is mentioned in Passage 2, [S83], which states that during the subprime crisis, Fuld kept his job while rivals' CEOs resigned. The board's reluctance to challenge Fuld is mentioned in [S84], which relates to corporate governance. \n\nAnother point is [S85] noting Lehman's assets before bankruptcy, but that's more about financial status. The repo 105 is tied to the financial statements, which might be related to the subprime crisis context. Also, the legal challenges like the SEC's case and the JPMorgan settlement in [S213] could be part of the legal challenges interconnected with leadership decisions.\n\nSo, the key sentences would be [S205] about repo 105, [S206] linking to Fuld and Ernst & Young, [S208] potential legal consequences, [S83] and [S84] about Fuld's leadership during the crisis and the board's inaction. The SEC's statement in [S209] also shows legal challenges. \n\nI need to make sure these are correctly cited. The subprime crisis is mentioned in [S83], so that's important. The corporate governance part is in [S84], where the board didn't challenge Fuld. The accounting practice is [S205], and the legal aspects are [S206][S208][S209]. \n\nPutting this together, the answer should connect these points, showing how the accounting practices (repo 105) involved leadership (Fuld) and legal issues, and during the subprime crisis, the governance allowed Fuld to stay despite the crisis."

    "[S1] Lehman Brothers\n\n\n# Lehman Brothers\n\n\n\n**Lehman Brothers Inc.** (/\u02c8li\u02d0m\u0259n/ LEE-m\u0259n) was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. [S2] Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. [S3] It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. [S4] Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. [S5] Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008. [S6] On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. [S7] The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. [S8] Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S9] The market collapse also gave support to the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. [S10] After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted. [S11] The following day, major British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, a significant and controlling interest in Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions, along with its New York headquarters building. [S12] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. [S13] Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. [S14] Peck. [S15] The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. [S16] The deal became effective on October 13, 2008. [S17] ## History\n\n\n### Under the Lehman family (1850\u20131969)\n\nIn 1844, 23-year-old Hayum Lehmann, who changed his name to Henry Lehman, the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from Rimpar, Bavaria. [S18] He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a dry-goods store, \"H. [S19] Lehman\". [S20] In 1847, following the arrival of his brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became \"H. [S21] Lehman and Bro.\" With the arrival of their youngest brother, Mayer Lehman, in 1850, the firm changed its name again and \"Lehman Brothers\" was founded. [S22] During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama's highest-grossing cash crop. [S23] Until the U.S. [S24] Civil War, nearly all U.S. [S25] cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama's total population. [S26] Mayer Lehman was listed as the owner of seven slaves (\"three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50\") in the U.S. [S27] Census of 1860. [S28] Capitalizing on cotton's high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from slave plantations as payment for merchandise, eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. [S29] Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. [S30] Following Henry's death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations.",
    "[S31] By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to New York City, where factors and commission houses were based. [S32] Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 Liberty Street, and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office. [S33] In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the Civil War, the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr & Co. [S34] Following the war the company helped finance Alabama's reconstruction. [S35] The firm's headquarters was eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the New York Cotton Exchange in 1870, commodifying the crop; Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. [S36] The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business. [S37] Lehman became a member of the Coffee Exchange as early as 1883 and finally the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. [S38] In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company. [S39] Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. [S40] In that year, under Emanuel's son Philip Lehman, the firm partnered with Goldman, Sachs & Co., to bring the General Cigar Co. [S41] to market, followed closely by Sears, Roebuck and Company. [S42] Among these were F.W. [S43] Woolworth Company, May Department Stores Company, Gimbel Brothers, Inc., R.H. [S44] Macy & Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. [S45] Goodrich Co., and Endicott Johnson Corporation. [S46] Following Philip Lehman's retirement in 1925, his son Robert \"Bobbie\" Lehman took over as head of the firm. [S47] During Bobbie's tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the Great Depression by focusing on venture capital while the equities market recovered. [S48] In 1924, John M. [S49] Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm, followed by Monroe C. [S50] Gutman and Paul Mazur, who became partners in 1927. [S51] By 1928, the firm had moved to its One William Street location. [S52] In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the initial public offering of the first television manufacturer, DuMont Laboratories, and helped fund the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). [S53] It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies Halliburton and Kerr-McGee. [S54] In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of Digital Equipment Corporation. [S55] Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by Compaq. [S56] ### An evolving partnership (1969\u20131984)\n\nRobert Lehman died in 1969 after 44 years in a leadership position for the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership. [S57] At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. [S58] By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, Pete Peterson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bell & Howell Corporation, was brought in to save the firm. [S59] Under Peterson's leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham & Co. [S60] in 1975, and two years later merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., the country's fourth-largest investment bank, behind Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and First Boston. [S61] Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry. [S62] By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm's investment bankers and traders prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. [S63] Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman's management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO.",
    "[S64] Upset bankers, who had soured over the power struggle, left the company. [S65] Stephen A. [S66] Schwarzman, chairman of the firm's M&A committee, recalled in a February 2003 interview with *Private Equity International* that \"Lehman Brothers had an extremely competitive internal environment, which ultimately became dysfunctional.\" The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm. [S67] ### Merger with American Express (1984\u20131994)\n\nShearson/American Express, an American Express-owned securities company focused on brokerage rather than investment banking, acquired Lehman in 1984, for $360\u00a0million. [S68] On May 11, the combined firms became Shearson Lehman/American Express. [S69] From 1983 to 1990, Peter A. [S70] Cohen was CEO and chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he led the $1 billion purchase of E.F. [S71] Hutton to form Shearson Lehman Hutton. [S72] In 1989, Shearson backed F. [S73] Ross Johnson's management team in its attempted management buyout of RJR Nabisco, but were ultimately outbid by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who was backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert. [S74] ### Divestment and independence (1994\u20132008)\n\nIn 1993, under newly appointed CEO Harvey Golub, American Express began to divest itself of its banking and brokerage operations. [S75] It sold its retail brokerage and asset management operations to Primerica and in 1994 it spun off Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in an initial public offering, as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. [S76] After being spun off, Dick Fuld became CEO of the company. [S77] Fuld steered Lehman through the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and when the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund collapsed in 1998. [S78] In 2001, the firm acquired the private-client services, or \"PCS\", business of Cowen & Co. [S79] and later, in 2003, aggressively re-entered the asset-management business, which it had exited in 1989. [S80] Beginning with $2 billion in assets under management, the firm acquired the Crossroads Group, the fixed-income division of Lincoln Capital Management and Neuberger Berman. [S81] These businesses, together with the PCS business and Lehman's private-equity business, comprised the Investment Management Division, which generated approximately $3.1 billion in net revenue. [S82] During the subprime mortgage crisis, Fuld kept his job while CEOs of rivals like Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup were forced to resign. [S83] In addition, Lehman's board of directors, which included retired CEOs like Vodafone's Christopher Gent and IBM's John Akers were reluctant to challenge Fuld as the firm's share price spiraled lower. [S84] In May 2008, prior to going bankrupt, the firm had $639 billion in assets. [S85] ### Response to September 11, 2001 attacks\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Lehman occupied three floors (38\u201340) of 1 World Trade Center, where one of its employees was killed in the terrorist attacks of that day. [S86] Its global headquarters in Three World Financial Center were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris, displacing over 6,500 employees. [S87] Trading operations moved to Jersey City, New Jersey. [S88] When stock markets reopened on September 17, 2001, Lehman's sales and trading capabilities were restored. [S89] In the ensuing months, the firm spread its operations across New York City in over 40 temporary locations. [S90] The investment-banking division converted the first-floor lounges, restaurants, and all 665 guest rooms of the Sheraton Manhattan Hotel into office space.",
    "[S91] The bank also experimented with flextime (to share office space) and remote work via virtual private networking after the attacks. [S92] In October 2001, Lehman purchased a 32-story, 1,050,000-square-foot (98,000\u00a0m\u00b2) office building for a reported sum of $700 million. [S93] The building, located at 745 Seventh Avenue, had recently been completed, and not yet occupied, by rival Morgan Stanley. [S94] Lehman began moving into the new facility in January and finished in March 2002. [S95] The firm did not return to Three World Financial Center as its structural integrity had not been given a clean bill of health, and the company could not have waited for repairs to Three World Financial Center to conclude. [S96] After the attacks, Lehman's management placed increased emphasis on business continuity planning. [S97] Aside from its headquarters in Three World Financial Center, Lehman maintained operations-and-backoffice facilities in Jersey City, space that the firm considered leaving prior to 9/11. [S98] The space was not only retained, but expanded, including the construction of a backup-trading facility. [S99] ### June 2003 SEC litigation\n\nIn June 2003, the company was one of ten firms which simultaneously entered into a settlement with the U.S. [S100] Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office of the New York State Attorney General and various other securities regulators, regarding undue influence over each firm's research analysts by its investment-banking divisions. [S101] Regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated analyst compensation with the firms' investment-banking revenues, and promised favorable, market-moving research coverage, in exchange for underwriting opportunities. [S102] The settlement, known as the \"global settlement\", provided for total financial penalties of $1.4 billion, including $80 million against Lehman, and structural reforms including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments, no analyst compensation, directly or indirectly, from investment-banking revenues, and the provision of free, independent, third-party, research to the firms' clients. [S103] ## Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)\n\nLehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of mortgage origination. [S104] In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender, Aurora Loan Services (not a bank), an Alt-A lender. [S105] In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. [S106] Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. [S107] By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending. [S108] By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. [S109] By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month. [S110] By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. [S111] From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. [S112] In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital. [S113] ## Collapse\n\n\n### Causes\n\n\n#### Malfeasance\n\nA March 2010 report by the court appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. [S114] This practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the company's balance sheet. [S115] However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created \"a materially misleading picture of the firm's financial condition in late 2007 and 2008\". [S116] #### Subprime mortgage crisis",
    "[S117] In August 2007, the firm closed its subprime lender, BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took an after-tax charge of $25\u00a0million and a $27\u00a0million reduction in goodwill. [S118] Lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space \"necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space.\"\n\nIn September 2007, Joe Gregory appointed Erin Callan as CFO. [S119] On March 16, 2008, after rival Bear Stearns was taken over by JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale, market analysts suggested that Lehman would be the next major investment bank to fall. [S120] Callan fielded Lehman's first quarter conference call, where the firm posted a profit of $48.9 million, compared to Citigroup's $5.1 billion and Merrill Lynch's $1.97 billion losses which was Lehman's 55th consecutive profitable quarter. [S121] The firm's stock price leapt 46 percent after that announcement. [S122] In 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis. [S123] Lehman's loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages; it is unclear whether Lehman was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds or voluntarily kept them. [S124] In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008. [S125] In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8\u00a0billion and was forced to sell off $6\u00a0billion in assets. [S126] In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten. [S127] On June 9, 2008, Lehman Brothers announced a US$2.8 billion second-quarter loss, its first since being spun off from American Express, as market volatility rendered many of its hedges ineffective during that time. [S128] Lehman also reported that it had raised a further $6 billion in capital. [S129] As a result, there was major management shakeup, in which Hugh \"Skip\" McGee III (head of investment banking) held a meeting with senior staff to strip CEO Richard Fuld and his lieutenants of their authority. [S130] Consequently, Joe Gregory agreed to resign as president and COO, and afterward he told Erin Callan that she had to resign as CFO. [S131] Callan was appointed CFO of Lehman in 2008 but served only for six months, before departing after her mentor Joe Gregory was demoted. [S132] Bart McDade was named to succeed Gregory as president and COO, when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted. [S133] McDade took charge and brought back Michael Gelband and Alex Kirk, who had previously been pushed out of the firm by Gregory for not taking risks. [S134] Although Fuld remained CEO, he soon became isolated from McDade's team. [S135] In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September. [S136] On August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled Korea Development Bank was considering buying the bank. [S137] Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news came in that Korea Development Bank was \"facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal.\"\n\nOn September 9, Lehman's shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold. [S138] Investor confidence continued to erode as Lehman's stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the S&P 500 down 3.4% on September 9. [S139] The Dow Jones lost 300 points the same day on investors' concerns about the security of the bank. [S140] The U.S. [S141] government did not announce any plans to assist with any possible financial crisis that emerged at Lehman.",
    "[S142] The next day, Lehman announced a loss of $3.9\u00a0billion and its intent to sell off a majority stake in its investment-management business, which included Neuberger Berman. [S143] The stock slid seven percent that day. [S144] Lehman, after earlier rejecting questions on the sale of the company, was reportedly searching for a buyer as its stock price dropped another 40 percent on September 11, 2008. [S145] Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, executives at Neuberger Berman sent e-mail memos suggesting, among other things, that the Lehman Brothers' top people forgo multimillion-dollar bonuses to \"send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance.\" Lehman Brothers Investment Management Director George Herbert Walker IV dismissed the proposal, going so far as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea having been suggested. [S146] He wrote, \"Sorry team. [S147] I am not sure what's in the water at Neuberger Berman. [S148] I'm embarrassed and I apologize.\"\n\n\n#### Short-selling allegations\n\nDuring hearings on the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers and bailout of AIG before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld said a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked short-selling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to both the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. [S149] House committee Chairman Henry Waxman said the committee received thousands of pages of internal documents from Lehman and these documents portray a company in which there was \"no accountability for failure\". [S150] An article by journalist Matt Taibbi in *Rolling Stone* contended that naked short selling contributed to the demise of both Lehman and Bear Stearns. [S151] A study by finance researchers at the University of Oklahoma Price College of Business studied trading in financial stocks, including Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and found \"no evidence that stock price declines were caused by naked short selling\". [S152] ### Bankruptcy\n\nOn Saturday, September 13, 2008, Timothy F. [S153] Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets. [S154] Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company's possible sale; however, both Barclays and Bank of America ultimately declined to purchase the entire company, in the former case because the British government (in particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the CEO of the Financial Services Authority Hector Sants) refused to allow the transaction at the last minute, quoting stockholder regulations in the UK, despite a deal having apparently been completed. [S155] The next day, Sunday, September 14, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) offered an exceptional trading session to allow market participants to offset positions in various derivatives on the condition of a Lehman bankruptcy later that day. [S156] Although the bankruptcy filing missed the deadline, many dealers honored the trades they made in the special session.",
    "[S157] Shortly before 1\u00a0am Monday morning (UTC\u22125), Lehman Brothers Holdings announced it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing bank debt of $613\u00a0billion, $155\u00a0billion in bond debt, and assets worth $639\u00a0billion. [S158] It further announced that its subsidiaries would continue to operate as normal. [S159] A group of Wall Street firms agreed to provide capital and financial assistance for the bank's orderly liquidation and the Federal Reserve, in turn, agreed to a swap of lower-quality assets in exchange for loans and other assistance from the government. [S160] The morning witnessed scenes of Lehman employees removing files, items with the company logo, and other belongings from the world headquarters at 745 Seventh Avenue. [S161] The spectacle continued throughout the day and into the following day. [S162] Brian Marsal, co-chief executive of the restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal was appointed as chief restructuring officer and subsequently chief executive officer of the company. [S163] Later that day, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) suspended Lehman's Australian subsidiary as a market participant after clearing-houses terminated contracts with the firm. [S164] Lehman shares tumbled over 90% on September 15, 2008. [S165] The Dow Jones closed down just over 500 points on September 15, 2008, which was at the time the largest drop in a single day since the days following the attacks on September 11, 2001. [S166] In the United Kingdom, the investment bank went to administration with PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed as administrators. [S167] In Japan, the Japanese branch, Lehman Brothers Japan Inc., and its holding company filed for civil reorganization on September 16, 2008, in Tokyo District Court. [S168] On September 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Lehman Brothers. [S169] On March 16, 2011 some three years after filing for bankruptcy and following a filing in a Manhattan U.S. [S170] bankruptcy court, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc announced it would seek creditor approval of its reorganization plan by October 14 followed by a confirmation hearing to follow on November 17. [S171] ### Liquidation\n\n\n#### Barclays acquisition\n\nOn September 16, 2008, Barclays PLC announced that they would acquire a \"stripped clean\" portion of Lehman for $1.75\u00a0billion, including most of Lehman's North America operations. [S172] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of the deal, a $1.35\u00a0billion (\u00a3700\u00a0million) plan for Barclays to acquire the core business of Lehman (mainly its $960-million headquarters, a 38-story office building in Midtown Manhattan, with responsibility for 9,000 former employees), was approved. [S173] After a 7-hour hearing, U.S. [S174] bankruptcy judge James Peck ruled:\n\n> \"I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. [S175] Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. [S176] This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I've ever sat through. [S177] It can never be deemed precedent for future cases. [S178] It's hard for me to imagine a similar emergency.\"",
    "[S179] Luc Despins, then a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the creditors committee counsel, said: \"The reason we're not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. [S180] We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it.\" In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb $47.4\u00a0billion in securities and assume $45.5\u00a0billion in trading liabilities. [S181] Lehman's attorney Harvey R. [S182] Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said \"the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29\u00a0billion, including $960\u00a0million for Lehman's New York headquarters and $330\u00a0million for two New Jersey data centers. [S183] Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at $1.02\u00a0billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at $900\u00a0million.\" Barclays were not to acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but to have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. [S184] Finally, Lehman would retain $20\u00a0billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. [S185] Barclays acquired a potential liability of $2.5\u00a0billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days. [S186] #### Nomura acquisition\n\nNomura Holdings, Japan's top brokerage firm, agreed to buy the Asian division of Lehman Brothers for $225\u00a0million and parts of the European division for a nominal fee of $2. [S187] It would not take on any trading assets or liabilities in the European units. [S188] Nomura negotiated such a low price because it acquired only Lehman's employees in the regions, and not its stocks, bonds or other assets. [S189] The last Lehman Brothers Annual Report identified that these non-US subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced. [S190] #### Sale of asset management businesses\n\nOn September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell Neuberger Berman, part of its investment management business, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman, for $2.15\u00a0billion. [S191] The transaction was expected to close in early 2009, subject to approval by the U.S. [S192] Bankruptcy Court, but a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction on December 3, 2008. [S193] Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. [S194] retain a 49% common equity interest in the firm, now known as Neuberger Berman Group LLC. [S195] In Europe, the Quantitative Asset Management Business has been acquired back by its employees on November 13, 2008 and has been renamed back to TOBAM. [S196] ### Financial fallout\n\nLehman's bankruptcy was the largest failure of an investment bank since Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed in 1990 amid fraud allegations. [S197] Immediately following the bankruptcy filing, an already distressed financial market began a period of extreme volatility, during which the Dow experienced its largest one day point loss, largest intra-day range (more than 1,000 points) and largest daily point gain. [S198] What followed was what many have called the \"perfect storm\" of economic distress factors and eventually a $700bn bailout package (Troubled Asset Relief Program) prepared by Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, and approved by Congress. [S199] The Dow eventually closed at a new six-year low of 7,552.29 on November 20, followed by a further drop to 6626 by March of the next year. [S200] The fall of Lehman also had a strong effect on small private investors such as bond holders and holders of so-called minibonds. [S201] In Germany, structured products, often based on an index, were sold mostly to private investors, elderly, retired persons, students and families. [S202] Most of those now worthless derivatives were sold by the German arm of Citigroup, the German Citibank now owned by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n### Ongoing litigation",
    "[S203] On March 11, 2010, Anton R. [S204] Valukas, a court-appointed examiner, published the results of its year-long investigation into the finances of Lehman Brothers. [S205] This report revealed that Lehman Brothers used an accounting procedure termed repo 105 to temporarily exchange $50\u00a0billion of assets into cash just before publishing its financial statements. [S206] The action could be seen to implicate both Ernst & Young, the bank's accountancy firm and Richard S. [S207] Fuld, Jr, the former CEO. [S208] This could potentially lead to Ernst & Young being found guilty of financial malpractice and Fuld facing time in prison. [S209] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, in March 2011, the SEC announced that they weren't confident that they could prove that Lehman Brothers violated US laws in its accounting practices. [S210] In October 2011, the administrators of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. [S211] lost their appeal to overturn a court order forcing them to pay \u00a3148 million into their underfunded pensions plan. [S212] As of January 2016, Lehman paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors. [S213] In addition, JPMorgan will pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of draining Lehman Brothers liquidity right before the crash. [S214] The settlement would permit another $1.496 billion to be paid to creditors and a separate $76 million deposit. [S215] The brokerage unit of Lehman Brothers completed its liquidation process on September 28, 2022, after paying out over $115 billion to its customers and creditors over the course of 14 years. [S216] As of December 2022, Lehman's British operations were being administrated by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which expected to complete the administration process no earlier than 2025. [S217] ## Merger and acquisition history\n\nThe following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):\n\n\n## Former officers\n\n* Richard S. [S218] Fuld Jr. [S219] * Scott J. [S220] Freidheim\n* Rodger Krouse (born 1961)\n* Jack Langer (born 1948/1949), basketball player and investment banker\n* Bart McDade\n* Hugh McGee\n* George Herbert Walker IV\n* Frederick M. [S221] Warburg\n* Joseph Rosenberg\n\n## In popular culture\n\nThe events of the weekend leading up to Lehman's bankruptcy are dramatized in the 2009 BBC television film *The Last Days of Lehman Brothers*. [S222] In the 2010 animated film *Despicable Me*, the main character Gru visits the Bank of Evil, which funds all evil plots for villains around the world and has a sign reading \"Formerly Lehman Brothers\". [S223] The 2011 drama film *Margin Call* focuses on the events of a 24-hour period at a large investment bank based on an amalgam of investment banks, drawing heavily from the culture of Lehman Brothers. [S224] However, the events in the film are primarily a depiction of the actions of Goldman Sachs. [S225] The 2011 HBO film *Too Big to Fail* recounts the days before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the fallout afterward. [S226] The 2011 film *Horrible Bosses* features a character by the name of Kenny Sommerfield (played by P. [S227] J. [S228] Byrne) who worked at Lehman Brothers until its bankruptcy, ending up broke. [S229] The fall of Lehman Brothers is depicted in the 2015 film *The Big Short*, where two of the characters walk around the Lehman Brothers offices after the bankruptcy to see the main trading floor. [S230] In Imbolo Mbue's 2016 debut novel *Behold the Dreamers*, an immigrant from Cameroon is a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers. [S231] In the 2016 animated film *Zootopia*, there is a brief appearance of a bank called Lemming Brothers, which is staffed by lemmings. [S232] *The Lehman Trilogy* is a three-act play by Italian dramatist Stefano Massini about the history of the Lehman Brothers. [S233] In the 2019 Showtime comedy series *Black Monday*, a fictionalized version of Lehman Brothers with an altered spelling is central to the plot and represented by brothers Larry & Lenny Leighman.
