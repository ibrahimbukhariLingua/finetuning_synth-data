      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S20] On 10 August 2022, Rapidus was established by eight Japanese companies with total investment of 7.3 billion yen for domestic production of advanced semiconductors; with further investments totaling $36 billion expected over a decade. [S21] Rapidus is led by Tetsuro Higashi (who formerly led Tokyo Electron) and Atsuyoshi Koike (who formerly led Western Digital's Japanese subsidiary). [S22] In the same year, METI and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) publicly solicited applications for advanced semiconductor development consignment projects related to strengthening the foundation of post-5G communication systems, which resulted in 70 billion yen of government subsidies for Rapidus. [S23] On 6 December 2022, the Belgium-based Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre\u00a0(imec) announced it had signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Rapidus, where both companies will set up a long-term and sustainable collaboration on advanced semiconductor technologies, while Rapidus would plan to mass-produce chips in 2-nanometer technology in Japan in the latter half of 2020s. [S24] On 13 December 2022, IBM and Rapidus announced the development of 2 nanometer node technology, with production of the nanosheet gate-all-around FET (GAA FET) devices previously announced by IBM in 2021 to be done by Rapidus at its fab in Japan.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the performance improvements expected from Rapidus's 2nm chips compared to 7nm chips and how that aligns with their partnerships and production timeline.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me scan through them. \n\nLooking for mentions of 2nm vs 7nm performance. There's [S25] which states that 2nm chips are expected to have up to 45% better performance and use 75% less energy compared to 7nm chips. That's a key point. So the performance improvement is 45% better performance and 75% less energy. That's the answer to the first part.\n\nNext, how does this align with partnerships and production timeline? Let's check the partnerships. There's [S23] about imec collaboration, [S24] with IBM, [S28] joining imec's Core Partner Program, [S34] government subsidies, [S35] ASML opening an office. Also, the production timeline: [S23] mentions mass production in 2nm tech in Japan in the latter half of the 2020s. [S36] says full operation not until 2027, pilot line in 2025. \n\nThe partnerships with IBM and imec are mentioned, and the government support. The timeline aligns with the 2020s production, and the 2025 pilot line. The performance improvements would make their chips more competitive, which aligns with their partnerships for advanced tech and the government backing to achieve this.\n\nSo the answer should include the 45% performance improvement and 75% energy reduction from [S25], and the partnerships with IBM, imec, ASML, and the production timeline from [S23][S36], etc. Need to make sure citations are correctly placed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Rapidus's role in Japan's semiconductor agreements with India and the U.S., and how these partnerships affect its global strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage for mentions of Rapidus and the agreements with India and the U.S. Let me scan each sentence.\n\nLooking at the supporting context, there's a section under 2023. In S30, it says that Rapidus and Tokyo Electron were discussed as companies playing a major role in a new MOU between Japan and India, involving $35.9 billion in investment by 2027. Then S31 mentions a similar deal between the U.S. and India, which was reached by Biden and Modi. So Rapidus is part of the Japan-India agreement, and the U.S.-India deal is mentioned as a separate but similar agreement. \n\nThe question is about Japan's agreements with both India and the U.S. But the passage specifically mentions the Japan-India agreement in S30 and the U.S.-India deal in S31. However, the user is asking about Japan's agreements with both, so maybe the U.S. part is part of the same context. But the passage doesn't explicitly say that Japan is involved in the U.S.-India deal. Wait, the U.S.-India deal is between the U.S. and India, not Japan. So maybe the user is conflating the two. But the passage says that the Japan-India agreement was signed, and the U.S.-India deal was reached earlier. \n\nSo Rapidus's role is in the Japan-India agreement. The question also asks about the U.S., but the passage doesn't mention Japan's agreement with the U.S. directly. However, the user might be referring to the U.S.-India deal, which could be part of the broader context. But the passage doesn't state that Japan is part of the U.S.-India deal. So perhaps the answer should focus on the Japan-India agreement and note that the U.S.-India deal is separate. \n\nThe impact on global strategy would be that by partnering with India and possibly the U.S., Rapidus is expanding its international collaborations, securing investments, and positioning itself in key markets. The partnerships could help Rapidus access new markets, share technology, and strengthen its position in the semiconductor industry. The government support and collaborations with companies like IBM, imec, and ASML also contribute to this strategy.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with citations. The role in Japan-India agreement is in S30. The U.S. part might not have a direct citation, but the user might be referring to the U.S.-India deal mentioned in S31. However, since the question is about Japan's agreements, maybe only S30 is relevant. The impact on global strategy would be inferred from the collaborations and investments mentioned in various sentences like S20, S22, S28, S34, etc. But the user specifically asks about the agreements with India and the U.S., so the citations should focus on those parts.\n\nSo the answer would state that Rapidus played a major role in Japan's semiconductor agreement with India (S30), and the U.S.-India deal is mentioned as a separate agreement (S31). The impact on global strategy includes expanding partnerships, securing investments, and leveraging government support. Citations would be [S30] for the role in the India agreement, and [S31] for the U.S.-India deal. However, the user might be asking about Japan's agreements with both, but the passage only explicitly mentions Japan's agreement with India. The U.S. part is part of the U.S.-India deal, not Japan's. So the answer should clarify that."

[S46] Including the JP \u00a5330 billion in subsidies that have already been decided, the total amount of support will reach nearly JP \u00a51 trillion. [S47] On April 11, the company announced the establishment of a new company, Rapidus Design Solutions, in Silicon Valley, United States. [S48] Henri Richard was appointed president. [S49] In addition to selling to major American IT companies, Rapidus Design Solutions (RDS) aim to secure software and design engineers to create semiconductors that meet customer requests. [S50] The expansion of RDS in the U.S. [S51] is also to build upon Rapidus's already existing presence there, with it having more than 100 engineers and scientists working at the Albany NanoTech Complex facility in New York. [S52] In November 2024, the new government under Shigeru Ishiba announced US$65 billion in government funding through 2030 to support the semiconductor industry, with much of it allocated for Rapidus.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Rapidus\n\n\n# Rapidus\n\n\n\n**Rapidus Corporation** (Japanese: Rapidus\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, Hepburn: *Rapidus Kabushiki-gaisha*) is a semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. [S2] Rapidus was established in August 2022 with the support of eight major Japanese companies: Denso, Kioxia, MUFG Bank, NEC, NTT, SoftBank, Sony, and Toyota. [S3] The goal of Rapidus is to increase advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity with a 2 nm process by 2027. [S4] ## Background history\n\nThe semiconductor industry in Japan was highly competitive in the 1980s, with a global share reaching 50%. [S5] However, the 1986 Japan-United States semiconductor agreement\u00a0[ja] concluded to resolve trade friction and the rise of South Korea and Taiwan gradually reduced competitiveness. [S6] In 1999, Elpida Memory was established by integrating the businesses of Hitachi and NEC for DRAM, one of the semiconductors for memory, and later took over the business of Mitsubishi Electric, and at one point acquired the world's third-largest market share in this field. [S7] However, management deteriorated due to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent strong yen induced recession, and although support was provided with government funds, it went bankrupt in 2012. [S8] Elpida was acquired by Micron Technology in 2013, and changed its name to Micron Memory Japan in 2014. [S9] Due to international competition from companies including TSMC, Samsung Electronics, and Intel, the share of Japanese companies in the semiconductor industry as a whole has fallen to 10% as of 2019. [S10] In May 2022, United States President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met in Tokyo and discussed increased collaboration on important technologies, including semiconductors, nuclear power, space exploration, electric batteries, critical minerals, and supply chains. [S11] The Second Kishida Cabinet's basic policy (*Honebuto no h\u014dshin*) announced on 7 June 2022 included consideration of support for private companies developing next-generation advanced technologies and the establishment of a design and manufacturing infrastructure for next-generation semiconductors in the latter half of the 2020s. [S12] On 29 July 2022, high-level talks were held between the United States and Japan by U.S. [S13] Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. [S14] Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and Japanese Trade Minister Koichi Hagiuda to discuss collaboration for semiconductors development. [S15] In addition, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's policy speech at the 210th session of the Diet\u00a0[ja] on 3 October 2022 included digital transformation (DX) by encouraging public and private investment, and announced that it would promote the technological development and mass production of next-generation semiconductors through Japan-U.S. [S16] collaboration. [S17] The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has decided to establish the Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC) as an organization to conduct next-generation semiconductor research in anticipation of joint research between the two countries based on the basic principles of semiconductor cooperation between Japan and the United States agreed on in May.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the financial commitments the Japanese government has made to support Rapidus and how these relate to broader geopolitical and industrial strategies.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts. Let me start by scanning Passage 1 for any mentions of financial support. \n\nLooking at the sentences, [S45] mentions that the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry announced up to JP \u00a5590 billion in additional support to Rapidus. Then [S46] adds that including previous subsidies of JP \u00a5330 billion, the total reaches nearly JP \u00a51 trillion. Also, [S52] states that the new government under Shigeru Ishiba announced US$65 billion in funding through 2030 for the semiconductor industry, with much allocated to Rapidus. \n\nNow, for the broader strategies, I need to connect these financial commitments to geopolitical and industrial strategies. In Passage 2, [S10] mentions that Japanese companies' share in the semiconductor industry fell to 10% by 2019, which might indicate a need to regain competitiveness. [S11] talks about the 2022 meeting between Biden and Kishida discussing collaboration on semiconductors, which is a geopolitical aspect. [S17] mentions promoting next-gen semiconductors through Japan-U.S. collaboration. [S18] states that METI established LSTC for joint research, and [S19] notes LSTC and Rapidus collaborating on a design and manufacturing platform. Also, [S3] mentions Rapidus's goal to increase advanced semiconductor manufacturing with a 2nm process by 2027, which is an industrial strategy.\n\nSo the financial commitments are the \u00a5590 billion additional, \u00a5330 billion already decided, totaling \u00a51 trillion, and the US$65 billion through 2030. These relate to regaining competitiveness (S10), Japan-U.S. collaboration (S11, S17, S18), and developing next-gen tech (S3, S19). \n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check if all citations are correctly linked. For example, the total funding mentions S45, S46, and S52. The geopolitical strategies would cite S11, S17, S18, and S10. The industrial strategies would include S3, S19, and maybe S10 again. Need to ensure each part is covered without missing any key points."

[S17] The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has decided to establish the Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC) as an organization to conduct next-generation semiconductor research in anticipation of joint research between the two countries based on the basic principles of semiconductor cooperation between Japan and the United States agreed on in May. [S18] LSTC and Rapidus collaborate to establish a design and manufacturing platform for next-generation semiconductors in Japan. [S19] ## Company history\n\n\n### 2022"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the technical challenges associated with the RISC-V architecture used by Tenstorrent and how Rapidus plans to address them. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Tenstorrent using RISC-V, so I should find where that's discussed. Looking at Passage 1, sentence S43 says that Tenstorrent's architecture is based on RISC-V. Then, S44 mentions the biggest challenge is optimizing the calculation pipeline and maximizing microfabrication technology for a multi-stage pipeline. \n\nSo the technical challenges here are the optimization of the calculation pipeline and the need for advanced microfabrication. Now, how does Rapidus plan to address these? The context doesn't explicitly state Rapidus's plans. The passage talks about Rapidus producing the chips and the government support, but not specific strategies for RISC-V challenges. \n\nWait, maybe the collaboration with LSTC (mentioned in S43 and S18) could be a point. Since LSTC is involved in next-gen semiconductor research, perhaps that's part of the solution. But the passage doesn't directly link Rapidus's plans to address these challenges. The answer might be that the challenges are pipeline optimization and microfabrication, but the passage doesn't specify how Rapidus is addressing them. \n\nSo the answer would state the challenges as per S44, but there's no direct info on Rapidus's solutions. The user might need to infer based on their collaboration, but the context doesn't provide explicit citations for solutions. Therefore, the answer should mention the challenges with citations and note that the passage doesn't specify the solutions."

The user is asking how government support and international collaborations influenced Rapidus's strategy and operational plans, and specifically what financial commitments the Japanese government made.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passage and pick out the relevant sentences. Let me scan each sentence.\n\nStarting with [S20], it mentions Rapidus was established with 7.3 billion yen investment and $36 billion expected over a decade. But I need to check if that's government support or private investment. The passage says \"eight Japanese companies\" so maybe private, but maybe the government is involved elsewhere.\n\n[S22] talks about METI and NEDO soliciting applications, leading to 70 billion yen in government subsidies for Rapidus. That's a direct financial commitment. So that's a key point.\n\n[S28] mentions Rapidus received additional funding of 260 billion yen from the Japanese government in April 2023. Another financial commitment.\n\n[S33] states that the company has been supported by around US$2.5 billion in government subsidies from the Kishida administration. That's another figure.\n\nThen there's [S23] about the collaboration with imec, and [S24] with IBM. Those are international collaborations. The collaboration with IBM on 2nm tech, and imec's partnership. Also, the partnership with Tenstorrent in [S37] and [S38], though that's Canadian. \n\nThe question also asks about how these influenced strategy and operations. For example, the collaboration with imec and IBM would influence their technology development. The location choice in Hokkaido [S27] and [S28] might be part of their operational plans. The government subsidies would affect their funding and ability to proceed with construction and production.\n\nThe financial commitments from the Japanese government include the 70 billion yen in [S22], 260 billion yen in [S28], and US$2.5 billion in [S33]. Also, the total funding needed is $37 billion [S29], but that's total, not just government. The initial 7.3 billion yen might be from the companies, but the government's part is the subsidies.\n\nSo, putting it together, the answer should mention the government subsidies (70B yen, 260B yen, 2.5B USD) and the international collaborations with imec, IBM, and Tenstorrent. The strategy and operations would include technology development, factory location in Hokkaido, and partnerships for advanced tech.\n\nNeed to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with correct citations. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, [S34] mentions the 2.5B USD, [S28] 260B yen, [S22] 70B yen. Also, the 36B expected over a decade in [S20], but that's total investment, not sure if government's part. The user is asking specifically about Japanese government's financial commitments, so focus on those subsidies."

[S2] Rapidus was established in August 2022 with the support of eight major Japanese companies: Denso, Kioxia, MUFG Bank, NEC, NTT, SoftBank, Sony, and Toyota. [S3] The goal of Rapidus is to increase advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity with a 2 nm process by 2027. [S4] ## Background history\n\nThe semiconductor industry in Japan was highly competitive in the 1980s, with a global share reaching 50%. [S5] However, the 1986 Japan-United States semiconductor agreement\u00a0[ja] concluded to resolve trade friction and the rise of South Korea and Taiwan gradually reduced competitiveness. [S6] In 1999, Elpida Memory was established by integrating the businesses of Hitachi and NEC for DRAM, one of the semiconductors for memory, and later took over the business of Mitsubishi Electric, and at one point acquired the world's third-largest market share in this field. [S7] However, management deteriorated due to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent strong yen induced recession, and although support was provided with government funds, it went bankrupt in 2012. [S8] Elpida was acquired by Micron Technology in 2013, and changed its name to Micron Memory Japan in 2014. [S9] Due to international competition from companies including TSMC, Samsung Electronics, and Intel, the share of Japanese companies in the semiconductor industry as a whole has fallen to 10% as of 2019. [S10] In May 2022, United States President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met in Tokyo and discussed increased collaboration on important technologies, including semiconductors, nuclear power, space exploration, electric batteries, critical minerals, and supply chains. [S11] The Second Kishida Cabinet's basic policy (*Honebuto no h\u014dshin*) announced on 7 June 2022 included consideration of support for private companies developing next-generation advanced technologies and the establishment of a design and manufacturing infrastructure for next-generation semiconductors in the latter half of the 2020s. [S12] On 29 July 2022, high-level talks were held between the United States and Japan by U.S. [S13] Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. [S14] Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and Japanese Trade Minister Koichi Hagiuda to discuss collaboration for semiconductors development.

    "[S41] According to a February 27, 2024 Bloomberg article, Rapidus announced that it has been contracted to produce next-generation AI chips from Canadian startup Tenstorrent. [S42] Tenstorrent is the first customer announced by Rapidus. [S43] The architecture that Tenstorrent outsourced to Rapidus for production and development is based on RISC-V, and its benefits are close to what the university stakeholders, who are the main members of Japan's Leading-edged Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC), desire (because of its open Instruction set architecture). [S44] Furthermore, the biggest challenge in the relevant architecture is said to be the optimization of the calculation pipeline, and maximizing microfabrication technology is also an important issue in order to realize a multi-stage pipeline. [S45] On April 2, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry of Japan announced that it would provide up to JP \u00a5590 billion in additional support to Rapidus. [S46] Including the JP \u00a5330 billion in subsidies that have already been decided, the total amount of support will reach nearly JP \u00a51 trillion. [S47] On April 11, the company announced the establishment of a new company, Rapidus Design Solutions, in Silicon Valley, United States. [S48] Henri Richard was appointed president. [S49] In addition to selling to major American IT companies, Rapidus Design Solutions (RDS) aim to secure software and design engineers to create semiconductors that meet customer requests. [S50] The expansion of RDS in the U.S. [S51] is also to build upon Rapidus's already existing presence there, with it having more than 100 engineers and scientists working at the Albany NanoTech Complex facility in New York. [S52] In November 2024, the new government under Shigeru Ishiba announced US$65 billion in government funding through 2030 to support the semiconductor industry, with much of it allocated for Rapidus."
