      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S195] Water losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. [S196] In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. [S197] According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession non-revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. [S198] According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. [S199] This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. [S200] Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. [S201] ### Tariffs\n\n**Tariff increases**. [S202] Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. [S203] This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. [S204] **Affordability**. [S205] According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. [S206] According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent. [S207] **Comparison with other cities**. [S208] At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005. [S209] They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012). [S210] ### Profitability\n\nThe concession contracts fixed a 22 percent annual rate of return for the private operators. [S211] The net profit of Palyja varied between Rp 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and Rp 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. [S212] Palyja's financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rp 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rp 142 billion (USD 16 million). [S213] However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. [S214] Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies. [S215] ### Customer satisfaction\n\nThe Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. [S216] In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28 percent for responsiveness to complaints. [S217] Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. [S218] According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2011. [S219] According to a survey carried out by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. [S220] However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S131] In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S132] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S133] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S134] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S135] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. [S136] The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (**Aetra**). [S137] Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets. [S138] In 2008 performance targets were further reduced as part of the rate rebasing for the period 2008-2012. [S139] In 2009 water tariffs were also frozen. [S140] ### Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)\n\nIn 2011 the provincial parliament of Jakarta instructed PAM Jaya to begin negotiations with the two companies since it considered the contracts one-sided and disadvantageous to PAM Jaya. [S141] The negotiations reportedly stalled, and PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu was removed in December 2011. [S142] The situation of Palyja was the subject of a letter from the CEO of GDF Suez, Gerald Mestrallet, to the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, and were discussed at a meeting between then French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and the President of Indonesia in July 2011. [S143] The high level of these discussions suggest that the provincial government of Jakarta as the formal contractual partner is not the only interlocutor of the private companies in the negotiations. [S144] Meanwhile, voices including the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, the Jakarta Water Labor Union and many NGOs have called for the contracts to be terminated instead of engaging in negotiations, despite the threat of penalties for early termination estimated at 3.1 trillion Rupiahs (USD 347 million) to Palyja and 2.8 trillion Rupiahs (USD 313 million) to Aetra. [S145] In October 2012 Suez Environnement announced that it would sell its 51% share in Palyja to Manila Water, under the condition that the city council provided a letter of support. [S146] In June 2013 the city council and PAM Jaya, however, announced that they did not approve the sale, which was called off. [S147] The city instead announced its intention to buy the shares itself. [S148] ### Court case against privatization (since 2013)\n\nThe Coalition of Jakarta Residents Opposing Water Privatization (KMMSAJ) initiated a petition against the private management of Jakarta's water supply with 588 signatories in 2011 and supported a similar petition in court by 12 people in 2013. [S149] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled that the terms of the privatisation of Jakarta's water violated the common right to water guaranteed by Article 33 of the Constitution of Indonesia. [S150] The court also noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The government of Indonesia and the private operators lodged an appeal against the court decision. [S151] The concessions remained in place pending a final court decision. [S152] In February 2016, the appeal court reversed the district court decision on the ground that the claimants did not have standing to bring the claim. [S153] The claimants brought an appeal to the Supreme Court. [S154] ## Impact",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key reasons for the renegotiations of water concession contracts in Jakarta and how the legal challenges reflect the debate over water as a public versus private good.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections. Let me start by scanning Passage 2 because it mentions renegotiations and legal challenges. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)\" which starts with S141. It says that the provincial parliament instructed PAM Jaya to negotiate because the contracts were one-sided and disadvantageous. That's a key reason for renegotiations. Also, S143 mentions that the CEO of GDF Suez wrote to the Indonesian minister, and there were high-level discussions, indicating that the contracts weren't meeting expectations. \n\nLooking at the reasons for renegotiation, the contracts being one-sided and not meeting targets are mentioned. Also, in S137, Governor Fauzi Bowo froze tariffs because companies didn't meet targets. S138 says performance targets were reduced in 2008. So, underperformance by the private companies likely led to renegotiations. \n\nAnother point is the financial aspects. In Passage 1, there's mention of profits based on unpaid charges (S213-214), which might have caused issues. But the main reasons for renegotiation seem to be about not meeting targets and the contracts being unfair. \n\nFor the legal challenges, the court case in Passage 2, S149-154. The court ruled that privatization violated the common right to water (S150). This reflects the debate about water as a public good versus private. The legal challenge argued that water is a human right, hence should be public. The government and companies appealed, but the initial ruling highlighted the conflict between private management and public rights. \n\nAlso, the NGOs and unions mentioned in S145 calling for contract termination instead of negotiation show the public's stance. The threat of penalties for termination (S145) shows the financial stakes, but the legal battle is about the principle of water as a public good. \n\nSo, the key reasons for renegotiations are underperformance, one-sided contracts, and tariff issues. The legal challenges reflect the debate by emphasizing water as a human right, hence public, against private interests. \n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its citations. Let me check the sentences again to make sure I'm citing correctly. For example, the renegotiations due to one-sided contracts is S141. The court case is S150. The human right aspect is in S150. The underperformance leading to tariff freezes is S137 and S138. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. Also, avoid combining multiple points in one sentence unless they are directly related. Let me draft the answer now."

[S198] According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. [S199] This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. [S200] Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. [S201] ### Tariffs\n\n**Tariff increases**. [S202] Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. [S203] This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. [S204] **Affordability**. [S205] According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. [S206] According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent. [S207] **Comparison with other cities**. [S208] At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005. [S209] They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012). [S210] ### Profitability\n\nThe concession contracts fixed a 22 percent annual rate of return for the private operators. [S211] The net profit of Palyja varied between Rp 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and Rp 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. [S212] Palyja's financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rp 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rp 142 billion (USD 16 million). [S213] However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. [S214] Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies. [S215] ### Customer satisfaction\n\nThe Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. [S216] In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28 percent for responsiveness to complaints. [S217] Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. [S218] According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2011. [S219] According to a survey carried out by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. [S220] However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint.",
        "[S131] In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S132] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S133] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S134] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S135] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. [S136] The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (**Aetra**). [S137] Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets. [S138] In 2008 performance targets were further reduced as part of the rate rebasing for the period 2008-2012. [S139] In 2009 water tariffs were also frozen. [S140] ### Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)\n\nIn 2011 the provincial parliament of Jakarta instructed PAM Jaya to begin negotiations with the two companies since it considered the contracts one-sided and disadvantageous to PAM Jaya. [S141] The negotiations reportedly stalled, and PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu was removed in December 2011. [S142] The situation of Palyja was the subject of a letter from the CEO of GDF Suez, Gerald Mestrallet, to the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, and were discussed at a meeting between then French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and the President of Indonesia in July 2011. [S143] The high level of these discussions suggest that the provincial government of Jakarta as the formal contractual partner is not the only interlocutor of the private companies in the negotiations. [S144] Meanwhile, voices including the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, the Jakarta Water Labor Union and many NGOs have called for the contracts to be terminated instead of engaging in negotiations, despite the threat of penalties for early termination estimated at 3.1 trillion Rupiahs (USD 347 million) to Palyja and 2.8 trillion Rupiahs (USD 313 million) to Aetra. [S145] In October 2012 Suez Environnement announced that it would sell its 51% share in Palyja to Manila Water, under the condition that the city council provided a letter of support. [S146] In June 2013 the city council and PAM Jaya, however, announced that they did not approve the sale, which was called off. [S147] The city instead announced its intention to buy the shares itself. [S148] ### Court case against privatization (since 2013)\n\nThe Coalition of Jakarta Residents Opposing Water Privatization (KMMSAJ) initiated a petition against the private management of Jakarta's water supply with 588 signatories in 2011 and supported a similar petition in court by 12 people in 2013. [S149] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled that the terms of the privatisation of Jakarta's water violated the common right to water guaranteed by Article 33 of the Constitution of Indonesia. [S150] The court also noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The government of Indonesia and the private operators lodged an appeal against the court decision. [S151] The concessions remained in place pending a final court decision. [S152] In February 2016, the appeal court reversed the district court decision on the ground that the claimants did not have standing to bring the claim. [S153] The claimants brought an appeal to the Supreme Court. [S154] ## Impact"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how customer satisfaction metrics varied across different aspects of water service delivery and the inconsistencies between official surveys and customer experiences.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The relevant part is in Passage 1 under the \"Customer satisfaction\" section. Let me check the sentences there.\n\nLooking at [S216], it mentions that the Regulatory Body conducted surveys since 2003. In 2007, the satisfaction levels were 85% for water quality, 71% for continuity, 64% for pressure, and 28% for responsiveness to complaints. That shows variation across different aspects. Then, [S218] talks about Palyja's surveys through TNS Indonesia, showing an increase from 57% in 2005 to 75% in 2011. However, [S220] mentions a 2008 survey where over 70% were satisfied with pressure, quality, continuity, meter reading, and billing, but less than half of those who complained were satisfied with the response. \n\nSo the metrics vary: higher satisfaction for quality, continuity, pressure, but much lower for complaint responsiveness. The inconsistencies are that official surveys (like the Regulatory Body's) might not capture the complaint response issues, while Palyja's surveys show overall improvement but maybe don't highlight the complaint handling problems. Also, the Atma Jaya survey in [S220] notes high satisfaction in some areas but low satisfaction with complaint responses. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check if all the key points are covered: variation in metrics across aspects and the inconsistencies between surveys and actual experiences."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S170] The private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. [S171] However, these attempts have been fairly limited. [S172] For example, Palyja has installed so-called *Master Meters*, from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as Mercy Corps. [S173] As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. [S174] The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. [S175] In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. [S176] Piped connections were also expanded. [S177] One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an *output-based aid* grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. [S178] As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. [S179] 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. [S180] Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. [S181] It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. [S182] However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. [S183] These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \"mafia\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. [S184] ### Water sales\n\nThe concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. [S185] Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. [S186] In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m\u00b3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. [S187] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S188] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target. [S189] ### Service quality\n\nAccording to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. [S190] On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. [S191] Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. [S192] According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. [S193] One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes. [S194] ### Water losses\n\nPassage 2:\n[S50] Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. [S51] In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m\u00b3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m\u00b3. [S52] In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62). [S53] For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. [S54] **Deficit between water tariffs and water charges**. [S55] There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. [S56] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S57] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S58] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S59] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S60] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S61] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S62] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S63] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022. [S64] **Financing**. [S65] In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the European Investment Bank and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. [S66] To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. [S67] They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005. [S68] In 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. [S69] ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja. [S70] The loan has been criticised for having been based on \"careless assumptions\", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales. [S71] In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market. [S72] ### Water resources\n\n**Flooding**. [S73] Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. [S74] For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70 percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. [S75] However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that limited the impact of private companies' efforts to improve water access in Jakarta's slums and how these challenges interacted with the financial and regulatory structure.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me start by scanning the passage for relevant sentences. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a mention of private companies like Palyja and TPJ trying to install Master Meters and water kiosks. However, the impact is minimal because of limited size (S174). Also, there's a part about disincentives to connect the poor even with legal land titles (S182). The reasons listed here include low revenues from poor customers, higher costs to connect in dense areas, and a \"mafia\" of water vendors defending their monopoly (S183). \n\nThen in Passage 2, there's a lot about the financial structure. The water charge is indexed to inflation, but tariffs need council approval, which was frozen after the East Asian Crisis, causing deficits (S56). The tariff structure means connecting more poor customers lowers the average tariff, leading to deficits for PAM Jaya (S57, S58). PAM Jaya discourages connecting the poor to avoid budget burdens (S60). Also, there are arrears accumulating because PAM Jaya hasn't paid charges to operators (S63). \n\nThe financial aspects include loans and bonds, but some loans were criticized for unrealistic projections (S70). Regulatory issues include the City Council's role in tariff approvals and the responsibility for flood management lying with the government, not private companies (S75).\n\nSo, the factors contributing to limited impact are: \n1. Disincentives for private companies to connect the poor due to low revenues and high costs (S183).\n2. The financial structure where connecting poor customers reduces average tariffs, increasing deficits (S57, S58).\n3. PAM Jaya's role in discouraging connections to avoid budget issues (S60).\n4. The existence of a water vendor mafia that resists competition (S183).\n5. Regulatory issues like frozen tariffs and the need for council approval (S56).\n\nThese factors interact with the financial structure by creating a cycle where connecting the poor leads to financial losses for PAM Jaya, which in turn discourages private companies from expanding services. The regulatory environment, with frozen tariffs and bureaucratic hurdles, exacerbates these financial challenges. Additionally, the existing water vendor monopoly complicates efforts by private companies.\n\nI need to make sure each point is cited correctly. For example, the disincentives are in S183, the financial structure in S57, S58, S60, the mafia in S183, and the regulatory issues in S56 and S75. Also, the arrears and loan issues in S63 and S70. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should be in <statement> tags with appropriate citations. Need to check if all relevant sentences are covered and cited properly."

[S173] As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. [S174] The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. [S175] In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. [S176] Piped connections were also expanded. [S177] One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an *output-based aid* grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. [S178] As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. [S179] 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. [S180] Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. [S181] It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. [S182] However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. [S183] These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \"mafia\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. [S184] ### Water sales\n\nThe concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. [S185] Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. [S186] In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m\u00b3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. [S187] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S188] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target. [S189] ### Service quality\n\nAccording to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. [S190] On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. [S191] Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. [S192] According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. [S193] One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes. [S194] ### Water losses\n\nPassage 2:\n[S50] Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. [S51] In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m\u00b3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m\u00b3. [S52] In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62). [S53] For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. [S54] **Deficit between water tariffs and water charges**. [S55] There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. [S56] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S57] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S58] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S59] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S60] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S61] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S62] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S63] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022. [S64] **Financing**. [S65] In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the European Investment Bank and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. [S66] To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. [S67] They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005. [S68] In 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. [S69] ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja. [S70] The loan has been criticised for having been based on \"careless assumptions\", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales. [S71] In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market. [S72] ### Water resources\n\n**Flooding**. [S73] Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. [S74] For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70 percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. [S75] However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the tariff structure in Jakarta created a financial deficit for PAM Jaya and the role of frozen water tariffs in that. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The key sections are in Passage 2, especially the parts about the deficit between water tariffs and charges. \n\nLooking at the sentences, [S55] mentions two problems with the charging system. The first point is that water charges are indexed to inflation and automatically increased, but tariffs need council approval. Then, [S56] says the City Council froze tariffs after the East Asian Crisis, creating a deficit for PAM Jaya starting in 1998. That's a direct link between frozen tariffs and the deficit.\n\nAnother part is [S57], which explains that the freeze led to the deficit. Then [S58] talks about the tariff structure causing lower average tariffs as more poor people are connected. [S59] and [S60] explain that PAM Jaya gets higher revenues from wealthier customers but has to pay more to private companies for connecting poor customers, leading to a deficit. Also, [S63] mentions PAM Jaya hasn't paid charges, accumulating arrears. \n\nSo the main points are the frozen tariffs post-1998, the structure where poor customers pay less, and the resulting financial burden on PAM Jaya. The citations would be [S55][S56][S57][S58][S59][S60][S63]. \n\nI need to structure the answer into statements, each with their citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations in <cite>. Check for any other relevant sentences. Also, ensure that the answer clearly connects the frozen tariffs and the tariff structure to the deficit."

[S56] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S57] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S58] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S59] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S60] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S61] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S62] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S63] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022. [S64] **Financing**. [S65] In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the European Investment Bank and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. [S66] To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. [S67] They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005. [S68] In 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. [S69] ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja. [S70] The loan has been criticised for having been based on \"careless assumptions\", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales. [S71] In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market. [S72] ### Water resources\n\n**Flooding**. [S73] Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. [S74] For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70 percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. [S75] However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key financial strategies of private water companies like Palyja and Aetra and how their strategies faced criticism related to water sales projections.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Let me scan through each section.\n\nStarting with Passage 1, there's mention of Palyja's initiatives like Master Meters and water kiosks, and projects in Western Jakarta and Marunda with subsidies and connection fees. But the main financial strategies might be in Passage 2. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section on \"Financing\" where it talks about Palyja securing loans from the European Investment Bank and Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. They issued bonds in 2005 and got a loan from the Asian Development Bank in 2007. The ADB loan is criticized for \"careless assumptions\" based on unrealistic water sales projections. Also, there's mention of the deficit between water tariffs and charges, which relates to their financial structure. \n\nAnother part mentions that the concession contracts had targets to increase water sales, which did increase but not as much as expected. The criticism about assumptions would tie into the ADB loan's unrealistic projections. \n\nSo the key financial strategies are securing foreign loans, issuing local currency bonds, and relying on output-based aid grants. The criticism is about the unrealistic sales projections used to justify loans, like the ADB loan being based on \"careless assumptions.\"\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited properly. For example, the part about Palyja's loans and bonds is in S65-S69. The criticism of the ADB loan is S70. The water sales projections are mentioned in S185-S189. Also, the financing section mentions the deficit issues, which might relate to their strategies. \n\nWait, the question is about strategies and the criticism related to sales projections. So the strategies include securing loans and bonds, and the criticism is about the assumptions in those loans. Also, the part about the deficit between tariffs and charges might be a strategy or a problem. But the user is asking about strategies, so maybe the financing methods are the strategies. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements that cover these points, citing the relevant sentences. Let me check each part again to ensure accuracy."

[S2] Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. [S3] The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. [S4] The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return.

[S9] The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. [S10] They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. [S11] These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. [S12] In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. [S13] During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. [S14] This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers. [S15] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. [S16] The court noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court.

[S19] ### Water and the poor\n\nAccording to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. [S20] Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. [S21] Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. [S22] Some households also collect rainwater. [S23] According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water.",

[S167] However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010. [S168] It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures. [S169] ### Access by the poor",
        "[S1] Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\n\n# Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\n\n\n**Water privatisation in Jakarta** began when the British water company Thames Water entered into an agreement with the son of then-President Suharto in 1993 to obtain a water concession. [S2] Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. [S3] The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. [S4] The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. [S5] However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. [S6] The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. [S7] In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors. [S8] The main targets of the concession were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. [S9] The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. [S10] They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. [S11] These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. [S12] In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. [S13] During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. [S14] This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers. [S15] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. [S16] The court noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court. [S17] In October 2017, the Indonesian Supreme Court overturned the appeal and confirmed the District Court Ruling that the privatization of Jakarta's water was an illegal act. [S18] ## Background\n\nTo understand the context of water privatisation in Jakarta, it is useful to know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater overexploitation and land subsidence. [S19] ### Water and the poor\n\nAccording to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. [S20] Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. [S21] Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. [S22] Some households also collect rainwater. [S23] According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the effects of Jakarta's water sector privatization on long-term service coverage and water loss reduction, plus the implications of the legal battles over its legitimacy.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the sections. \n\nIn Passage 1, there are several sentences about service coverage and water losses. For example, [S155] mentions targets for service coverage and water losses. [S157] says that until 2004, private operators increased access and reduced water losses. [S159] gives specific stats: access went from 46% to 64% and water losses from 61% to 50%, but they didn't meet the revised targets. [S160] mentions that after 2008 targets were reduced, they reached most new targets. \n\nThen in Passage 2, [S8] states the main targets were to increase service coverage from 46% and reduce water losses from 61%. [S11] talks about the original targets being loosened to 68% and 42%, but in 2008 they only reached 64% and 50%. [S12] confirms that. Also, [S15] mentions tariffs tripled. \n\nFor the legal battles, [S15] mentions the court ruling in 2015 that privatization was illegal, [S16] says the operators won an appeal but [S17] states the Supreme Court overturned it in 2017. The implications here are that the legal battles led to the system being returned to public control, and the court's decision highlighted negligence in fulfilling the human right to water.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer. The first part about service coverage and water loss: mention the initial targets, the progress until 2004, the later failure to meet targets, and the revised targets being met. Then the legal implications: the court rulings and the return to public control.\n\nCitations should be attached to each relevant statement. For example, the increase in service coverage and reduction in water losses would cite [S157][S159][S11][S12]. The legal part would cite [S15][S16][S17].\n\nI need to make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Also, check if there are other relevant sentences. For instance, [S161] mentions overall access but maybe that's covered in the stats already. The BPS data in [S168] shows a decline, but the user is asking about the privatization effects, so maybe that's a conflicting data point but not directly part of the answer unless it's about implications. However, the question doesn't ask about conflicting data, just the effects and legal implications.\n\nSo the answer should be structured with two main parts: effects on service coverage and water loss, then the legal battles' implications. Each part with appropriate citations."

        "[S109] In June 1997 the two 25-year water concessions were awarded, becoming effective in February 1998. [S110] The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (**Palyja**), was awarded the concession for the western part of the city while the subsidiary of Thames Water International, called Thames PAM Jaya (**TPJ**), was awarded the concession for the eastern part. [S111] The concessions aimed to achieve universal service coverage and a reduction of non-revenue water to 20 percent at the end of the concession period. [S112] To that end the concessions foresaw private investments of Rupiahs 1,520 billion during the first five years of the concession alone. [S113] This corresponded to USD 610 million at the exchange rate at signing before the financial crisis. [S114] However, after the devaluation of the Rupiah during the East Asian financial crisis the value of these investment commitments dropped to USD 160 million. [S115] In the turmoil following the toppling of Suharto, most expatriates fled the country and the Director General of PAM Jaya moved to cancel the concession contracts. [S116] British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime. [S117] The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years. [S118] ### Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator\n\nDue to the impact of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a \"Restated Cooperative Agreement\" signed in October 2001. [S119] The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an \"independent\" regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. [S120] Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. [S121] By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. [S122] In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the claims made by the consumer group KRuHA against the concessionaires in 2004 and how the utilities responded. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage is divided into several sections with citations. Let me scan through each part.\n\nLooking at the section titled \"Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator,\" there's a mention of events in 2004. Specifically, sentence [S128] says: \"In 2004 a consumer group sued the concessionaires for providing poor services, based on a survey carried out by the Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water (KRuHA).\" That's the claim part. So the claim is that the concessionaires provided poor services, supported by a survey from KRuHA.\n\nNext, the response from the utilities. The next sentence, [S129], states: \"The lawyers of the utilities rejected the claims saying that the evidence presented was poor and that the survey to support the claims was not carried out by an independent agency.\" So the utilities disputed the claims by criticizing the evidence and the survey's lack of independence.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. The rest of the passage talks about tariff adjustments and other events, but nothing else about KRuHA's claims or the utilities' response. So the answer should reference sentences [S128] and [S129]. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with the required format. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with citations in <cite>. The first sentence states the claims, citing [S128]. The second sentence states the utilities' response, citing [S129]. \n\nI need to check if the sentences are correctly attributed and that there are no other citations needed. The user wants the answer as accurately as possible using the supporting context. Looks good. No other sentences seem relevant here."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S170] The private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. [S171] However, these attempts have been fairly limited. [S172] For example, Palyja has installed so-called *Master Meters*, from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as Mercy Corps. [S173] As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. [S174] The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. [S175] In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. [S176] Piped connections were also expanded. [S177] One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an *output-based aid* grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. [S178] As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. [S179] 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. [S180] Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. [S181] It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. [S182] However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. [S183] These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \"mafia\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. [S184] ### Water sales\n\nThe concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. [S185] Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. [S186] In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m\u00b3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. [S187] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S188] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target. [S189] ### Service quality\n\nAccording to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. [S190] On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. [S191] Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. [S192] According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. [S193] One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes. [S194] ### Water losses\n\nPassage 2:\n[S50] Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. [S51] In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m\u00b3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m\u00b3. [S52] In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62). [S53] For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. [S54] **Deficit between water tariffs and water charges**. [S55] There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. [S56] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S57] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S58] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S59] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S60] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S61] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S62] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S63] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022. [S64] **Financing**. [S65] In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the European Investment Bank and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. [S66] To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. [S67] They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005. [S68] In 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. [S69] ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja. [S70] The loan has been criticised for having been based on \"careless assumptions\", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales. [S71] In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market. [S72] ### Water resources\n\n**Flooding**. [S73] Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. [S74] For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70 percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. [S75] However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the decline in water sales in Jakarta's eastern half after 2004 reflects broader challenges in the privatization model and what the contractual target versus actual performance was.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections. Let me start by scanning for mentions of water sales in the eastern half. \n\nIn Passage 1, under the \"Water sales\" section, there's a mention that in the eastern half, sales increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to over 140 in 2004 but then declined to about 120 in 2007, which was below the contractual target. That's directly relevant. The contractual targets are mentioned in [S185], which states that the concession contracts included targets to increase water sales. The actual performance is detailed in [S187] and [S188] for the increase up to 2004, and [S189] for the decline after 2004.\n\nNow, how does this reflect broader challenges in the privatization model? The context mentions several issues. For example, in [S183], there are disincentives to connect the poor even with legal titles. The reasons include low revenues from poor customers, higher costs to connect them, and a \"mafia\" of water vendors opposing the connections. Additionally, [S184] talks about the existing issues under public management persisting under private management. \n\nAlso, in Passage 2, there's discussion about the deficit between water tariffs and charges. [S55] and onwards explain that the tariff structure leads to deficits when more poor customers are connected, which PAM Jaya (the public partner) tries to avoid, thus discouraging private companies from connecting the poor. This ties into the broader challenge of balancing profitability with social equity in privatization. The financial aspects, like the arrears PAM Jaya owes to operators ([S63]), and the loans taken by companies based on optimistic sales projections ([S70]), show financial risks and mismanagement.\n\nSo, the decline in sales in the eastern half after 2004 likely reflects these challenges: difficulty in connecting poor customers due to financial and structural barriers, existing monopolies, and the financial strain on both private companies and PAM Jaya. The contractual targets were not met because actual performance was hindered by these systemic issues.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. The first part about the decline and contractual targets would cite [S185][S187][S188][S189]. The broader challenges would cite [S183][S184][S55]-[S63], maybe [S184] for the mafia issue and [S55]-[S63] for the financial disincentives. However, I need to check each sentence to ensure correct citations.\n\nWait, the user wants each sentence in <statement> tags with citations. So I need to split the answer into multiple statements, each with their own citations. Let me make sure each statement is a separate sentence and the citations are correctly placed."

      "question": "How did the financial arrangement of Jakarta's water concessions aim to address public debt, and what unintended consequence did it create according to the source?",
      "answer": "<statement>The financial arrangement of Jakarta's water concessions aimed to address public debt by structuring water tariffs to generate a surplus, which was intended to pay back the government's debt from international loans totaling 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million).<cite>[S41][S42]</cite></statement> <statement>The unintended consequence of this arrangement was a shortfall for the public sector, as the system created financial challenges that undermined its original purpose, according to the authorities.<cite>[S46]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S24] The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. [S25] They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. [S26] While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. [S27] Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. [S28] Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. [S29] Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. [S30] Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. [S31] Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. [S32] According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. [S33] Boiling of water is frequent. [S34] Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality. [S35] ### Financial arrangements and the concessions\n\nUnder a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. [S36] The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. [S37] In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. [S38] However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. [S39] It consists of *water tariffs* collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from *water charges* paid by the government to the private operators. [S40] The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. [S41] The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. [S42] These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). [S43] The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m\u00b3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. [S44] It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. [S45] This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. [S46] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S47] **Water tariffs**. [S48] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:\n\n* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);\n* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);\n* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);\n* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. [S49] It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S76] **Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence**. [S77] Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far exceeds groundwater recharge, leading to a falling groundwater table and land subsidence. [S78] Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in the Sarinah bridge in 1978. [S79] Land subsidence is also caused by the weight of increasingly high buildings. [S80] It varies by neighbourhoods. [S81] Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. [S82] In North Jakarta the decline was 57\u00a0cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. [S83] In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28\u00a0cm only respectively. [S84] However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits. [S85] **Surface water used by the utilities**. [S86] The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from *Perum Jasa Tirta II*, a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. [S87] The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. [S88] Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70\u00a0km southeast of the city. [S89] According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations. [S90] The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned. [S91] Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30\u00a0km southwest of Jakarta. [S92] Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it. [S93] Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for backup supply. [S94] ## History\n\n\n### Prelude (1993-1997)\n\nIn 1993 the British water company Thames Water International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. [S95] For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President Suharto. [S96] Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo \u2013 which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. [S97] The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. [S98] It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. [S99] Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). [S100] Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. [S101] But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. [S102] In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. [S103] The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. [S104] Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. [S105] One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta. [S106] Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. [S107] However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation.

        "[S24] The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. [S25] They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. [S26] While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. [S27] Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. [S28] Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. [S29] Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. [S30] Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. [S31] Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. [S32] According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. [S33] Boiling of water is frequent.

[S35] ### Financial arrangements and the concessions\n\nUnder a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. [S36] The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. [S37] In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. [S38] However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. [S39] It consists of *water tariffs* collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from *water charges* paid by the government to the private operators. [S40] The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. [S41] The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. [S42] These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). [S43] The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m\u00b3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. [S44] It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. [S45] This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the financial arrangement of Jakarta's water concessions aimed to address public debt and what unintended consequence it created. I need to look through the provided passage to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of public debt. In Passage 1, under the section \"Financial arrangements and the concessions,\" there's a lot of detail. Specifically, sentences S41 and S42 mention that the original idea was for tariffs to be higher than charges paid to private operators, creating a surplus to pay back debt from international loans. The debt was 1.6 trillion Rupiahs. So that's the part about addressing public debt.\n\nNow, the unintended consequence. The same section says that the authorities now question the system's usefulness because it creates a shortfall for the public sector (S46). So the unintended consequence is a shortfall in the public sector due to the financial arrangement.\n\nI need to make sure these citations are correctly linked. The answer should state that the financial arrangement aimed to use tariff surpluses to pay back debt, citing S41 and S42. The unintended consequence is the public sector shortfall, citing S46. Let me check if there are other sentences that might be relevant, but I think those are the key ones. The rest of the passage talks about tariffs and categories, which might not be directly relevant here. So the answer should be structured with two statements, each citing the appropriate sentences."

[S96] Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo \u2013 which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. [S97] The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. [S98] It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. [S99] Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). [S100] Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. [S101] But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. [S102] In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. [S103] The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. [S104] Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. [S105] One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta. [S106] Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. [S107] However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that caused the uneven impact of water supply issues on different socioeconomic groups in Jakarta and how that relates to infrastructure and pricing policies. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two main sections. Let me start by scanning each sentence for relevant information.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there are several sentences that mention the poor and their issues. For example, [S24] talks about poor residents not being concerned about tariffs but worried about connection fees. [S25] mentions high connection fees being unaffordable. [S26] says wealthier residents use pumps and tanks, while poorer ones have low pressure. [S27] notes that water vendors aren't regulated. [S28] and [S29] discuss the costs of private wells and bottled water, which are expensive. [S30]-[S32] mention polluted water from wells and the need for boiling. [S34] says public water is sometimes unavailable and of poor quality. \n\nThen there's the part about the concession contracts. [S35]-[S47] explain the financial arrangements. The tariffs are differentiated, with higher categories paying more. [S48]-[S49] detail the seven categories, with the highest paying 14 times more than the lowest. This pricing structure likely affects different groups differently. The fixed charges for private operators [S43]-[S44] might not account for the ability to pay, leading to issues for the poor.\n\nIn Passage 2, [S76]-[S85] discuss groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence, which might affect water availability. However, the private companies don't extract groundwater, so maybe this is more about infrastructure. [S86]-[S94] talk about surface water sources, which might be insufficient, leading to reliance on polluted rivers, affecting water quality. But how does this tie into socioeconomic factors? Maybe poorer areas can't afford better water sources, leading to higher pollution exposure.\n\nThe history part [S95]-[S105] mentions the privatization and how companies were awarded contracts, possibly leading to infrastructure that serves certain areas better. The pricing policies with different categories [S48]-[S49] definitely contribute to the disparity. The poor are in lower tariff categories but might face higher costs through other means like private vendors or bottled water.\n\nSo, the factors include: \n1. High connection fees (S25) making it hard for the poor to connect to the network.\n2. Wealthier residents using pumps and tanks (S26), while poorer areas have intermittent supply.\n3. Unregulated water vendors (S27) leading to higher costs and lower quality.\n4. Expensive alternatives like bottled water (S29) and private wells (S28), which are unaffordable for the poor.\n5. Polluted water sources (S30-S32) requiring boiling (S33) which is a burden.\n6. Tariff differentiation (S48-S49) where higher categories pay more, but the poor are in lower tiers with possibly inadequate service.\n7. The financial arrangement of the concession (S35-S47) where fixed charges might not incentivize serving the poor effectively.\n\nThe infrastructure aspect is the concession contracts and the infrastructure development by private companies, which might not prioritize poorer areas. Pricing policies like the tariff categories and the fixed charges for private operators (S43-S44) also play a role. The uneven infrastructure development and pricing lead to different impacts on socioeconomic groups.\n\nI need to make sure each point is cited correctly. For example, the connection fees are in S25, the use of pumps in S26, vendors in S27, costs of alternatives in S28 and S29, pollution in S30-S32, public supply issues in S34, and the tariff structure in S48-S49. The concession financial arrangements are in S35-S47. Also, the groundwater issues in Passage 2 might relate to infrastructure but the private companies don't extract groundwater, so maybe that's more about the source rather than infrastructure. However, the surface water sources being insufficient (S90) could affect infrastructure planning.\n\nSo, the answer should list these factors with the relevant citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the appropriate citations. Need to structure the answer with statements and citations as per the format."

[S34] Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality. [S35] ### Financial arrangements and the concessions\n\nUnder a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. [S36] The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. [S37] In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. [S38] However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. [S39] It consists of *water tariffs* collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from *water charges* paid by the government to the private operators. [S40] The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. [S41] The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. [S42] These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). [S43] The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m\u00b3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. [S44] It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. [S45] This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. [S46] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S47] **Water tariffs**. [S48] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:\n\n* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);\n* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);\n* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);\n* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. [S49] It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S76] **Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence**. [S77] Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far exceeds groundwater recharge, leading to a falling groundwater table and land subsidence. [S78] Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in the Sarinah bridge in 1978. [S79] Land subsidence is also caused by the weight of increasingly high buildings. [S80] It varies by neighbourhoods. [S81] Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. [S82] In North Jakarta the decline was 57\u00a0cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. [S83] In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28\u00a0cm only respectively. [S84] However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits. [S85] **Surface water used by the utilities**. [S86] The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from *Perum Jasa Tirta II*, a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. [S87] The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. [S88] Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70\u00a0km southeast of the city. [S89] According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations. [S90] The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned. [S91] Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30\u00a0km southwest of Jakarta. [S92] Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it. [S93] Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for backup supply.

The passage has two main sections. Let me start by scanning for mentions of groundwater contamination and land subsidence.\n\nIn Passage 1, there are several sentences about groundwater. For example, [S30] mentions that water from wells is polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing near the coast. [S31] talks about high iron content in groundwater needing filtration. [S32] states that 90% of groundwater was contaminated by metals, nitrates, and e-coli in 2011. These points highlight groundwater contamination as a significant issue. \n\nThen, looking at land subsidence, Passage 2 has [S77] which directly mentions groundwater over-exploitation leading to land subsidence. [S78] notes the first identification of subsidence via cracks in a bridge in 1978. [S79] adds that building weight also causes subsidence, and [S81]-[S84] give specific data on subsidence rates in different areas of Jakarta. So land subsidence is linked to over-extraction of groundwater.\n\nNow, the second part of the question is about how private companies interact with these issues. In Passage 2, [S84] says private companies don't extract groundwater but buy surface water. [S86] mentions they buy from Perum Jasa Tirta II, which uses the West Tarum Canal. [S89] explains the water source is from a reservoir, but there's a risk of inadequate maintenance as per [S89]. Also, [S92] and [S93] talk about Palyja using polluted rivers after treatment. So private companies are using surface water instead of groundwater, but their sources might be problematic. However, the context doesn't explicitly link their operations to causing groundwater contamination or subsidence. Instead, it's the over-extraction by other entities (maybe residents or industries) that leads to subsidence. The private companies' operations might be exacerbating the problem if they are using surface water, but the passage doesn't directly state that. \n\nWait, the question is about how their operations interact. The passage says they don't extract groundwater, so maybe they aren't directly causing the subsidence. However, their reliance on surface water might be part of the broader water management issues. Also, the financial arrangements in Passage 1 might influence their operations, but the direct interaction with the mentioned issues isn't clear. The answer should focus on what's stated. \n\nSo, compiling the info: Groundwater contamination is due to pollution (bacteria, salt, iron) and land subsidence from over-extraction. Private companies don't extract groundwater but use surface water, which might have its own issues. The passage doesn't mention their direct interaction with subsidence, but their operations are separate from groundwater extraction. However, the financial structure in [S39]-[S45] might affect their incentives, but that's more about tariffs than the environmental issues. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly referenced. For groundwater contamination, [S30][S31][S32]. For land subsidence, [S77][S78][S79][S81]-[S84]. For private companies, [S84][S86][S89][S92][S93]. But the interaction part might not have direct citations. The answer should state that private companies don't extract groundwater, thus not contributing to subsidence, but their surface water sources have issues. However, the context doesn't explicitly say they interact with the issues, so maybe the answer is that their operations don't directly cause the contamination or subsidence but use alternative water sources."

[S43] The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m\u00b3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. [S44] It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. [S45] This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. [S46] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S47] **Water tariffs**. [S48] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:\n\n* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);\n* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);\n* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);\n* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. [S49] It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S76] **Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence**. [S77] Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far exceeds groundwater recharge, leading to a falling groundwater table and land subsidence. [S78] Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in the Sarinah bridge in 1978. [S79] Land subsidence is also caused by the weight of increasingly high buildings. [S80] It varies by neighbourhoods. [S81] Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. [S82] In North Jakarta the decline was 57\u00a0cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. [S83] In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28\u00a0cm only respectively. [S84] However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits. [S85] **Surface water used by the utilities**. [S86] The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from *Perum Jasa Tirta II*, a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. [S87] The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. [S88] Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70\u00a0km southeast of the city. [S89] According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations. [S90] The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned. [S91] Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30\u00a0km southwest of Jakarta. [S92] Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it. [S93] Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for backup supply. [S94] ## History\n\n\n### Prelude (1993-1997)\n\nIn 1993 the British water company Thames Water International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. [S95] For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President Suharto. [S96] Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo \u2013 which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. [S97] The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. [S98] It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. [S99] Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). [S100] Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. [S101] But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. [S102] In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. [S103] The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. [S104] Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. [S105] One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta. [S106] Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. [S107] However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation.

        "[S24] The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. [S25] They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. [S26] While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. [S27] Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. [S28] Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the historical context of Jakarta's water privatization involved political and corporate alliances and the implications for concession agreements. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passages. In Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Prelude (1993-1997)\" which mentions Thames Water International and Sigit Harjojudanto, who is the son of President Suharto. That's a political alliance. Then there's the French company Lyonnaise des Eaux (now Suez) partnering with the Salim Group, another Suharto crony. This shows corporate alliances with political figures.\n\nThe text also talks about the government splitting the concession into two halves, awarded without competition to the two groups. This suggests that political connections influenced the concession awards. The World Bank's pressure for privatization is mentioned, but the specific project didn't have privatisation conditions. That might relate to the implications of the concession agreements, maybe indicating external pressures but also the role of local politics.\n\nIn terms of implications, the concession agreements had unusual financial arrangements. The water tariffs and charges system is detailed, with different categories and subsidies. The fixed charges to private operators and the 22% return rate might have implications for public sector shortfalls, as mentioned in the context. Also, the fact that private companies don't extract groundwater but buy surface water from a state company could affect sustainability and water sources.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The political alliances are in S95-S102, mentioning Thames Water with Suharto's son and Lyonnaise des Eaux with Salim. The concession award details are in S95-S103, and the financial arrangements in S35-S47. The implications like public sector shortfalls are in S46 and S47. Also, the World Bank's role is in S107 and S108.\n\nI should structure the answer by first addressing the political and corporate alliances, citing the relevant sentences, then the implications for concession agreements, citing the financial arrangement sentences. Need to check if all citations are correctly numbered and that each statement is properly enclosed in <statement> tags with citations."

[S90] The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned. [S91] Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30\u00a0km southwest of Jakarta. [S92] Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it. [S93] Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for backup supply. [S94] ## History\n\n\n### Prelude (1993-1997)\n\nIn 1993 the British water company Thames Water International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. [S95] For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President Suharto. [S96] Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo \u2013 which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. [S97] The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. [S98] It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. [S99] Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). [S100] Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. [S101] But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. [S102] In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. [S103] The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. [S104] Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. [S105] One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta. [S106] Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. [S107] However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary sources of raw water for Jakarta's private water companies and the challenges they faced in meeting the city's growing demand.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me scan through them.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence\" which mentions that private companies don't extract groundwater but buy surface water. Then, under \"Surface water used by the utilities,\" it says the private companies mostly buy raw water from Perum Jasa Tirta II, which operates the West Tarum Canal system. This system provides 80% of Jakarta's raw water. The water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River. So that's a primary source. Also, Aetra gets all its raw water from there, and Palyja also uses the West Tarum Canal but supplements with treated water from Cisadane and water from the polluted Kali Krukut River and Ciliwung River during shortages.\n\nSo the primary sources are the West Tarum Canal (from Jatiluhur reservoir), Cisadane Treatment Plant, Kali Krukut River, and Ciliwung River. But the main one is the West Tarum Canal.\n\nNow, the challenges. The passage mentions that the current water sources are insufficient for the growing city, so new projects are planned. Also, the West Tarum Canal's maintenance is a problem as per the ADB report. The canal and pumping stations need maintenance. Also, the water from the canals might be polluted, like the Kali Krukut and Ciliwung rivers are polluted. Additionally, groundwater over-extraction causes land subsidence, but the private companies don't use groundwater. However, the surface water sources might be under stress due to demand. Also, the concession system's financial arrangements might not be effective, leading to shortfalls, but that's more about the financial structure than the water sources themselves.\n\nSo the challenges include insufficient supply, pollution of some water sources, maintenance issues in the canal system, and the need for new projects. Also, the reliance on surface water which may not be enough.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with citations. The primary sources are mentioned in S86, S87, S88, S92, S93, S94. The challenges are in S90 (maintenance), S91 (insufficient supply), and maybe S30, S31, S32 about pollution from wells, but those are more about groundwater. However, the private companies use surface water, so the pollution of rivers like Kali Krukut and Ciliwung (S93, S94) are challenges. Also, the land subsidence from groundwater overuse (S77, S78) might affect the city but not directly the water sources of the private companies. \n\nSo the answer should list the primary sources with their citations and the challenges with relevant citations. Need to make sure each sentence has the correct citations."

[S160] After targets were reduced to more realistic levels in 2008, the operators were able to reach most of their new targets. [S161] ### Overall access\n\nEstimates of how access to piped water changed during the concession period vary considerably. [S162] According to the regulatory agency, access increased substantially. [S163] In the Palyja service area it almost doubled from 209,000 customers in 1998 to 399,000 customers in 2008, exceeding the renegotiated contractual target of 392,000.

[S166] In the TPJ service area, access increased from about 57 percent in 1998 to about 67 percent in 2004, but stagnated afterwards. [S167] However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010. [S168] It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures.

[S2] Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. [S3] The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. [S4] The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. [S5] However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. [S6] The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. [S7] In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors. [S8] The main targets of the concession were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. [S9] The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. [S10] They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. [S11] These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. [S12] In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. [S13] During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. [S14] This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers. [S15] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. [S16] The court noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court. [S17] In October 2017, the Indonesian Supreme Court overturned the appeal and confirmed the District Court Ruling that the privatization of Jakarta's water was an illegal act. [S18] ## Background\n\nTo understand the context of water privatisation in Jakarta, it is useful to know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater overexploitation and land subsidence. [S19] ### Water and the poor\n\nAccording to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. [S20] Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. [S21] Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. [S22] Some households also collect rainwater. [S23] According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that led to the renegotiation of the original targets for service coverage and water losses in Jakarta's water concession contracts, and how the revised targets compared to the outcomes by 2008.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passages. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's a lot of information. Starting from [S1] to [S18], there's details about the water privatization in Jakarta. Specifically, [S5] mentions that after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah lost value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. Then [S6] says the concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. That seems like a key factor: the financial crisis and political changes leading to renegotiation.\n\nAlso, looking at [S8], it states the main targets were to increase service coverage from 46% and reduce water losses from 61%. The original targets were 75% service coverage by 2008 and 100% at the end, and water losses to 25% by 2008. But these were loosened during renegotiations to 68% and 42% respectively. \n\nIn Passage 1, [S159] mentions that by 2008, access increased to 64% (original target 68%) and water losses reduced to 50% (original target 42%). So the revised targets were lower than the original ones. The factors leading to renegotiation include the financial crisis, political instability, and maybe the difficulty in meeting the original targets. \n\nAnother point from [S6] is the tariff freeze, which might have made it harder for the companies to meet financial targets, hence needing renegotiation. Also, the initial targets might have been too ambitious given the economic situation. \n\nSo the factors are the East Asian financial crisis, the fall of Suharto, tariff freezes, and possibly the difficulty in achieving the original targets. The revised targets were lower than the original ones, but by 2008, the actual outcomes were still below the revised targets (64% vs 68% for service coverage, 50% vs 42% for water losses). Wait, no, water losses went from 61% to 50%, which is a reduction, but the target was 42%. So they didn't meet the revised target for water losses. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The renegotiation factors are in [S5] and [S6]. The original targets and revised targets are in [S8], [S9], [S10], [S11], [S12], and [S159]. The comparison of outcomes to revised targets is in [S159]. \n\nSo the answer should mention the financial crisis and political changes as factors leading to renegotiation. The revised targets were 68% service coverage and 42% water losses, but by 2008, service coverage was 64% and water losses were 50%, so they didn't meet the revised targets. Wait, but [S159] says \"revised target: 42 percent\" for water losses, but actual was 50%, which is higher. So the outcomes were worse than the revised targets. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its own citations. Let me check the sentences again to make sure."

The water tariff in the lowest category tripled from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3, while the highest category increased from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) during the same period. This growth far exceeded household income increases, thereby raising the financial burden on all consumers, including the poor.<cite>[S202][S203]</cite></statement> <statement>Evidence suggests that the share of water bills in the income of poor families (Category II) was 2.8% in 2008, according to a study by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, which declined to 1.6% by 2009 in Palyja\u2019s service area. Despite this reduction in percentage, the overall burden remained significant due to the rapid tariff increases outpacing income growth.<cite>[S205][S206]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S195] Water losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. [S196] In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. [S197] According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession non-revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. [S198] According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. [S199] This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. [S200] Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. [S201] ### Tariffs\n\n**Tariff increases**. [S202] Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. [S203] This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. [S204] **Affordability**. [S205] According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. [S206] According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent. [S207] **Comparison with other cities**. [S208] At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005. [S209] They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012). [S210] ### Profitability\n\nThe concession contracts fixed a 22 percent annual rate of return for the private operators. [S211] The net profit of Palyja varied between Rp 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and Rp 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. [S212] Palyja's financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rp 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rp 142 billion (USD 16 million). [S213] However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. [S214] Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies. [S215] ### Customer satisfaction\n\nThe Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. [S216] In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28 percent for responsiveness to complaints. [S217] Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. [S218] According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2011. [S219] According to a survey carried out by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. [S220] However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S131] In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S132] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S133] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S134] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S135] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. [S136] The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (**Aetra**). [S137] Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets. [S138] In 2008 performance targets were further reduced as part of the rate rebasing for the period 2008-2012. [S139] In 2009 water tariffs were also frozen. [S140] ### Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)\n\nIn 2011 the provincial parliament of Jakarta instructed PAM Jaya to begin negotiations with the two companies since it considered the contracts one-sided and disadvantageous to PAM Jaya. [S141] The negotiations reportedly stalled, and PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu was removed in December 2011. [S142] The situation of Palyja was the subject of a letter from the CEO of GDF Suez, Gerald Mestrallet, to the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, and were discussed at a meeting between then French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and the President of Indonesia in July 2011. [S143] The high level of these discussions suggest that the provincial government of Jakarta as the formal contractual partner is not the only interlocutor of the private companies in the negotiations. [S144] Meanwhile, voices including the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, the Jakarta Water Labor Union and many NGOs have called for the contracts to be terminated instead of engaging in negotiations, despite the threat of penalties for early termination estimated at 3.1 trillion Rupiahs (USD 347 million) to Palyja and 2.8 trillion Rupiahs (USD 313 million) to Aetra.

        "[S195] Water losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. [S196] In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. [S197] According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession non-revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. [S198] According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. [S199] This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. [S200] Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. [S201] ### Tariffs\n\n**Tariff increases**. [S202] Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. [S203] This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. [S204] **Affordability**. [S205] According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. [S206] According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent. [S207] **Comparison with other cities**. [S208] At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005. [S209] They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012). [S210] ### Profitability\n\nThe concession contracts fixed a 22 percent annual rate of return for the private operators. [S211] The net profit of Palyja varied between Rp 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and Rp 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. [S212] Palyja's financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rp 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rp 142 billion (USD 16 million). [S213] However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. [S214] Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies. [S215] ### Customer satisfaction\n\nThe Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. [S216] In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28 percent for responsiveness to complaints. [S217] Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. [S218] According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2011. [S219] According to a survey carried out by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. [S220] However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint.",
        "[S131] In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S132] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S133] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S134] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S135] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. [S136] The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (**Aetra**). [S137] Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the tariff increases between 1998 and 2010 interacted with the affordability of water for poor households and what evidence is provided.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context. The passage mentions tariff increases in [S202], stating that tariffs tripled from 1998 to 2010. That's a key point. Then, [S203] says this increase exceeded household income growth, making water more burdensome, especially for the poor. \n\nNext, affordability is addressed in [S205] and [S206]. The study from Atma Jaya in 2008 shows that poor families (Category II) spent 2.8% of their income on water, while Palyja's 2009 data shows 1.6%. These percentages indicate that even though tariffs went up, the share of income spent on water decreased slightly, but the context says the burden increased. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe the absolute cost increased more than income, so even if the percentage went down, the actual amount is higher. But the passage says \"increased the burden,\" so maybe the percentages are relative. Need to check the exact wording.\n\nAlso, [S208] and [S209] compare tariffs to other cities, but that's more about comparison than affordability. The main evidence for affordability is the study's percentages. The interaction between tariff increases and affordability is that despite the percentage decrease from 2.8% to 1.6%, the overall burden increased because tariffs rose faster than income. The evidence is the study data and the statement in [S203].\n\nSo the answer should mention the tripling of tariffs, the income growth not keeping up, and the study's figures. Citations would be [S202][S203][S205][S206]. Need to make sure each sentence is properly cited."

But how does that relate to the discrepancy?\n\nThe question also asks how this related to illegal connections. The passage says that illegal connections are part of water losses. So if there are more illegal connections, that would contribute to higher non-revenue water. But why were the targets not met? Maybe the presence of illegal connections made it harder to reduce losses. Also, the tariff increases (S202) might have made it harder for people to pay, leading to more illegal connections. \n\nLooking at the tariff section, S202-203 mention that tariffs increased threefold, which exceeded income growth, burdening consumers. This could lead to people connecting illegally to avoid paying. The affordability issues (S205-206) show that even though the percentage of income spent on water was low, the high tariffs might still push some to illegal connections. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's mention of tariff freezes and renegotiations, which might have affected the operators' ability to invest or manage losses. However, the direct factors related to the discrepancy are in Passage 1. The illegal connections are directly mentioned in S200. \n\nSo the factors contributing to the discrepancy include the slow reduction in water losses, the increase in the eastern concession, and the presence of illegal connections. The illegal connections are part of the water losses, so their existence would make it harder to meet targets. The tariff increases might have driven more illegal connections, especially among the poor. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. The first part about the discrepancy: S195, S196, S197, S198, S199. Then the relation to illegal connections: S200. Also, maybe the tariff issues (S202, S203) as factors that led to more illegal connections. But the question specifically asks about the factors causing the discrepancy, which includes the illegal connections. \n\nWait, the question is about why the actual performance didn't meet the targets. The answer would be that the reduction was slower than expected, and in the east, it increased. The reasons for that could be factors like illegal connections, which are part of water losses. So the answer should link the slow reduction and the increase to factors like illegal connections and possibly other issues like tariff increases leading to more illegal connections. \n\nSo the statements would be:\n\n- The discrepancy in the western concession was due to slower reduction than targeted (S195, S197, S199). \n- In the eastern concession, water losses increased again (S196, S198). \n- Illegal connections contributed to water losses (S200). \n- Tariff increases may have led to more illegal connections (S202, S203). \n\nBut the user wants the answer to directly answer the question. So the factors are the slow reduction, the increase in the east, and the presence of illegal connections. The relation to illegal connections is that they are part of the water losses, so their existence would affect the non-revenue water figures. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. Let me check each sentence again."

    "[S1] Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\n\n# Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\n\n\n**Water privatisation in Jakarta** began when the British water company Thames Water entered into an agreement with the son of then-President Suharto in 1993 to obtain a water concession. [S2] Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. [S3] The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. [S4] The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. [S5] However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. [S6] The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. [S7] In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors. [S8] The main targets of the concession were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. [S9] The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. [S10] They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. [S11] These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. [S12] In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. [S13] During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. [S14] This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers. [S15] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. [S16] The court noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court. [S17] In October 2017, the Indonesian Supreme Court overturned the appeal and confirmed the District Court Ruling that the privatization of Jakarta's water was an illegal act. [S18] ## Background\n\nTo understand the context of water privatisation in Jakarta, it is useful to know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater overexploitation and land subsidence. [S19] ### Water and the poor\n\nAccording to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. [S20] Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. [S21] Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. [S22] Some households also collect rainwater. [S23] According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water.",
    "[S24] The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. [S25] They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. [S26] While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. [S27] Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. [S28] Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. [S29] Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. [S30] Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. [S31] Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. [S32] According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. [S33] Boiling of water is frequent. [S34] Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality. [S35] ### Financial arrangements and the concessions\n\nUnder a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. [S36] The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. [S37] In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. [S38] However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. [S39] It consists of *water tariffs* collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from *water charges* paid by the government to the private operators. [S40] The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. [S41] The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. [S42] These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). [S43] The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m\u00b3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. [S44] It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. [S45] This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. [S46] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S47] **Water tariffs**. [S48] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:\n\n* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);\n* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);\n* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);\n* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. [S49] It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%).",
    "[S50] Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. [S51] In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m\u00b3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m\u00b3. [S52] In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62). [S53] For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. [S54] **Deficit between water tariffs and water charges**. [S55] There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. [S56] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S57] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S58] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S59] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S60] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S61] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S62] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S63] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022. [S64] **Financing**. [S65] In 1998 Palyja secured USD 61 million in loans from the European Investment Bank and the Singapore-based Calyon Merchant Bank Asia. [S66] To repay these foreign-currency loans, the company sought local-currency funding. [S67] They issued a Rupiahs 650 billion bond on the Indonesian stock market in 2005. [S68] In 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a Rupiahs 455 billion loan to Palyja. [S69] ADB did not require a government guarantee for its loan, which is a testimony to the creditworthiness of Palyja. [S70] The loan has been criticised for having been based on \"careless assumptions\", assuming unrealistic projections for future water sales. [S71] In 2008 Aetra followed the example of Palyja and also issued corporate bonds on the Indonesian stock market. [S72] ### Water resources\n\n**Flooding**. [S73] Flooding is a major problem affecting Jakarta. [S74] For example, the 2007 flood inundated more than 70 percent of the city and sent about 450,000 fleeing their homes. [S75] However, flood management is the responsibility of the government, not of the private water companies.",
    "[S76] **Groundwater over-exploitation and land subsidence**. [S77] Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far exceeds groundwater recharge, leading to a falling groundwater table and land subsidence. [S78] Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in the Sarinah bridge in 1978. [S79] Land subsidence is also caused by the weight of increasingly high buildings. [S80] It varies by neighbourhoods. [S81] Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. [S82] In North Jakarta the decline was 57\u00a0cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. [S83] In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28\u00a0cm only respectively. [S84] However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits. [S85] **Surface water used by the utilities**. [S86] The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from *Perum Jasa Tirta II*, a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. [S87] The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. [S88] Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70\u00a0km southeast of the city. [S89] According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations. [S90] The current water sources are insufficient to supply the growing city with its water needs and thus new water supply projects are being planned. [S91] Aetra gets its entire raw water from the West Tarum Canal, while Palyja complements low-price raw water from the West Tarum Canal by buying bulk treated water at higher prices from the Cisadane Treatment Plant owned by Tangerang District Water Works Enterprise 30\u00a0km southwest of Jakarta. [S92] Palyja also obtains water from the polluted Kali Krukut River in South Jakarta after passing through filtration wells and after treating it. [S93] Furthermore, in times of scarcity, water from the heavily polluted Ciliwung River is used for backup supply. [S94] ## History\n\n\n### Prelude (1993-1997)\n\nIn 1993 the British water company Thames Water International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. [S95] For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President Suharto. [S96] Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo \u2013 which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. [S97] The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. [S98] It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. [S99] Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). [S100] Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. [S101] But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. [S102] In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. [S103] The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. [S104] Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. [S105] One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta. [S106] Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. [S107] However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation. [S108] ### Concession award (1997)",
    "[S109] In June 1997 the two 25-year water concessions were awarded, becoming effective in February 1998. [S110] The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (**Palyja**), was awarded the concession for the western part of the city while the subsidiary of Thames Water International, called Thames PAM Jaya (**TPJ**), was awarded the concession for the eastern part. [S111] The concessions aimed to achieve universal service coverage and a reduction of non-revenue water to 20 percent at the end of the concession period. [S112] To that end the concessions foresaw private investments of Rupiahs 1,520 billion during the first five years of the concession alone. [S113] This corresponded to USD 610 million at the exchange rate at signing before the financial crisis. [S114] However, after the devaluation of the Rupiah during the East Asian financial crisis the value of these investment commitments dropped to USD 160 million. [S115] In the turmoil following the toppling of Suharto, most expatriates fled the country and the Director General of PAM Jaya moved to cancel the concession contracts. [S116] British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime. [S117] The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years. [S118] ### Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator\n\nDue to the impact of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a \"Restated Cooperative Agreement\" signed in October 2001. [S119] The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an \"independent\" regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. [S120] Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. [S121] By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. [S122] In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. [S123] After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in with the support of the Asian Development Bank about the so-called \"rate rebasing\" for the period 2002-2007. [S124] During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged. [S125] For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively. [S126] In July 2004 the City Council approved an automatic tariff adjustment (ATA) every six months over a five-year period to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators. [S127] The water tariff adjustment formula foresaw that increases of the water charge would be fully passed on to consumers, in addition to any changes in the financial requirements of the asset holding company PAM Jaya and the regulatory body. [S128] In 2004 a consumer group sued the concessionaires for providing poor services, based on a survey carried out by the Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water (KRuHA). [S129] The lawyers of the utilities rejected the claims saying that the evidence presented was poor and that the survey to support the claims was not carried out by an independent agency. [S130] ### Exit of Thames Water and freeze of water tariffs and charges (2006-2009)",
    "[S131] In January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S132] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S133] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S134] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S135] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. [S136] The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (**Aetra**). [S137] Governor Fauzi Bowo, who was elected as the successor of Governor Sutiyoso in 2007, froze the water tariffs, saying that the companies did not achieve their contractual targets. [S138] In 2008 performance targets were further reduced as part of the rate rebasing for the period 2008-2012. [S139] In 2009 water tariffs were also frozen. [S140] ### Renegotiations and exit of Suez (2011-2012)\n\nIn 2011 the provincial parliament of Jakarta instructed PAM Jaya to begin negotiations with the two companies since it considered the contracts one-sided and disadvantageous to PAM Jaya. [S141] The negotiations reportedly stalled, and PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu was removed in December 2011. [S142] The situation of Palyja was the subject of a letter from the CEO of GDF Suez, Gerald Mestrallet, to the Indonesian Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, and were discussed at a meeting between then French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and the President of Indonesia in July 2011. [S143] The high level of these discussions suggest that the provincial government of Jakarta as the formal contractual partner is not the only interlocutor of the private companies in the negotiations. [S144] Meanwhile, voices including the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, the Jakarta Water Labor Union and many NGOs have called for the contracts to be terminated instead of engaging in negotiations, despite the threat of penalties for early termination estimated at 3.1 trillion Rupiahs (USD 347 million) to Palyja and 2.8 trillion Rupiahs (USD 313 million) to Aetra. [S145] In October 2012 Suez Environnement announced that it would sell its 51% share in Palyja to Manila Water, under the condition that the city council provided a letter of support. [S146] In June 2013 the city council and PAM Jaya, however, announced that they did not approve the sale, which was called off. [S147] The city instead announced its intention to buy the shares itself. [S148] ### Court case against privatization (since 2013)\n\nThe Coalition of Jakarta Residents Opposing Water Privatization (KMMSAJ) initiated a petition against the private management of Jakarta's water supply with 588 signatories in 2011 and supported a similar petition in court by 12 people in 2013. [S149] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled that the terms of the privatisation of Jakarta's water violated the common right to water guaranteed by Article 33 of the Constitution of Indonesia. [S150] The court also noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The government of Indonesia and the private operators lodged an appeal against the court decision. [S151] The concessions remained in place pending a final court decision. [S152] In February 2016, the appeal court reversed the district court decision on the ground that the claimants did not have standing to bring the claim. [S153] The claimants brought an appeal to the Supreme Court. [S154] ## Impact",
    "[S155] The concession contracts included specific targets for service coverage, water production, water sales and non-revenue water. [S156] The contracts also foresaw that by the 2008, the tenth contract year, drinking water quality standards had to be met and that water supply had to be continuous at a pressure of 7.5 meters water column. [S157] Until 2004 both private operators succeeded to increase the share of the population with access to water and reduced water losses in line with the renegotiated contractual targets. [S158] After 2004 they further increased access and reduced water losses, but did not reach the targets any more. [S159] Overall, from 1998 to 2008 access to water increased from 46 to 64 percent (revised target: 68 percent) and water losses were reduced from 61 percent to 50 percent (revised target: 42 percent). [S160] After targets were reduced to more realistic levels in 2008, the operators were able to reach most of their new targets. [S161] ### Overall access\n\nEstimates of how access to piped water changed during the concession period vary considerably. [S162] According to the regulatory agency, access increased substantially. [S163] In the Palyja service area it almost doubled from 209,000 customers in 1998 to 399,000 customers in 2008, exceeding the renegotiated contractual target of 392,000. [S164] In the TPJ service area it increased less quickly during the same period from 278,000 to 380,000 customers, somewhat below the target of 403,000. [S165] In relative terms, Palyja says that in its concession area access almost doubled from 34 percent in 1998 to 59 percent in 2007 and 64 percent in 2011. [S166] In the TPJ service area, access increased from about 57 percent in 1998 to about 67 percent in 2004, but stagnated afterwards. [S167] However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010. [S168] It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures. [S169] ### Access by the poor",
    "[S170] The private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. [S171] However, these attempts have been fairly limited. [S172] For example, Palyja has installed so-called *Master Meters*, from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as Mercy Corps. [S173] As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. [S174] The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. [S175] In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. [S176] Piped connections were also expanded. [S177] One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an *output-based aid* grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. [S178] As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. [S179] 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. [S180] Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. [S181] It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. [S182] However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. [S183] These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \"mafia\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. [S184] ### Water sales\n\nThe concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. [S185] Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. [S186] In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m\u00b3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. [S187] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S188] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target. [S189] ### Service quality\n\nAccording to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. [S190] On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. [S191] Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. [S192] According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. [S193] One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes. [S194] ### Water losses",
    "[S195] Water losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. [S196] In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. [S197] According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession non-revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. [S198] According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. [S199] This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. [S200] Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. [S201] ### Tariffs\n\n**Tariff increases**. [S202] Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. [S203] This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. [S204] **Affordability**. [S205] According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. [S206] According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent. [S207] **Comparison with other cities**. [S208] At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005. [S209] They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012). [S210] ### Profitability\n\nThe concession contracts fixed a 22 percent annual rate of return for the private operators. [S211] The net profit of Palyja varied between Rp 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and Rp 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. [S212] Palyja's financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rp 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rp 142 billion (USD 16 million). [S213] However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. [S214] Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies. [S215] ### Customer satisfaction\n\nThe Regulatory Body for Water Services has conducted customer satisfaction surveys covering the entire service area since 2003. [S216] In 2007 the survey showed the following levels of satisfaction among respondents: 85 percent for water quality, 71 percent for continuity, 64 percent for pressure, but only 28 percent for responsiveness to complaints. [S217] Palyja has conducted its own annual customer satisfaction surveys in its service area through the opinion research institute Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Indonesia since 2005. [S218] According to these figures, customer satisfaction increased from 57 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2011. [S219] According to a survey carried out by Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, more than 70% of customers were satisfied with water pressure, water quality, continuity of supply, meter reading and billing. [S220] However, less than half the customers that made a complaint were satisfied with the response to the complaint."
