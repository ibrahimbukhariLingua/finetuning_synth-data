      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the positions Sheu Yu-jer held before becoming Minister of Finance and who the premier was that appointed him.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. Let me go sentence by sentence. \n\nStarting with [S1], it just mentions his name and dates, nothing about positions. [S2] talks about his education, so not relevant here. [S3] mentions he served as director-general of the Taxation Agency within the Ministry of Finance. That's a position before becoming Minister. Then [S4] says by 2013, he was deputy finance minister under Chang Sheng-ford. So those are two positions: director-general of Taxation Agency and deputy finance minister. \n\nNext, [S5] mentions he was appointed finance minister by Premier Lin Chuan on 15 April 2016. So the premier is Lin Chuan. The question is asking who appointed him, so that's Lin Chuan. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other positions mentioned. The rest of the sentences [S6] about being replaced, [S7] leading the Taiwan Futures Exchange, and [S8] his death don't add more positions before becoming Minister. \n\nSo the answer should list the positions from [S3] and [S4], and the premier from [S5]. Citations would be [S3][S4] for the positions and [S5] for the premier. Let me structure the sentences accordingly."
