      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about David Foot's academic and professional trajectory and how his transition from macroeconometrics to economic demography influenced his research and policy engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage starts by mentioning David Foot's education: undergraduate at the University of Western Australia and graduate work at Harvard under Martin Feldstein. Then it says he joined the University of Toronto's economics department after his PhD. That's his academic background.\n\nNext, the passage talks about his shift from macroeconometrics to economic demography. The key sentences here are [S5] which mentions his early works on macroeconometrics and then turning to economic demography. His research focus is on demographics' impact on economics, especially aging baby boomers. There's also mention of his book \"Boom Bust & Echo\" co-authored with Daniel Stoffman, which became a bestseller and led to his active role in policy debates.\n\nI need to structure the answer into two parts: his trajectory and the influence of his transition. For the trajectory, the education and academic positions are important. For the transition's impact, the shift in research focus and policy engagement are key. Citations should be attached to each relevant part. Let me check the sentences again to make sure I get the right citations. \n\nFor example, his education is covered in [S2][S3][S4]. The transition is in [S5], research focus in [S6][S7][S8], the book in [S9][S10][S11]. The selected readings might not be necessary unless they relate to his trajectory, but the question is about his academic path and the transition's influence. So the main citations would be [S2][S3][S4][S5][S6][S7][S8][S9][S10][S11]. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations.

The contribution to public discourse would be through making his research accessible, and the policy engagement is directly mentioned in S10. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the themes and topics in David Foot's selected academic publications and how they reflect his broader research interests. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage has several sections. The \"Economic demographics\" section mentions his focus on the impact of demographics on economics, especially the aging baby boomers. It also states that demographic shifts have social and economic consequences, like crime, leisure, and school enrollment. There's a quote where he says demographics explains \"two-thirds of everything.\" His book \"Boom Bust & Echo\" is mentioned, which is about demographic shifts and became a bestseller. \n\nThen there's the \"Selected readings\" section with titles of his works. The titles themselves give some clues: \"Population Aging,\" \"Tourism and Education in Western Europe: A Demographic Perspective,\" \"Easter Island: A Case Study in Non-Sustainability,\" \"Age Structure, Income Distribution and Economic Growth,\" and \"Boom Bust & Echo.\" These suggest themes like population aging, demographic impacts on various sectors (tourism, education, sustainability), and economic growth related to age structure.\n\nThe user also wants to know how these reflect his broader research interests. From the passage, it's clear that his work centers around economic demography, the effects of demographic changes, and their policy implications. The mention of his active role in policy debates and the focus on aging populations, sustainability, and economic growth all point to his broader interests in how demographics shape economic and social outcomes.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited properly. For example, the part about demographic shifts and their consequences is in S6-S8. The quote about \"two-thirds of everything\" is S8. The book \"Boom Bust & Echo\" is mentioned in S9 and S10. The selected readings are listed with their respective citations. \n\nI should structure the answer by listing the themes and topics, each supported by the relevant citations. Then connect them to his broader interests based on the information provided. Make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations in the <cite> tags."

    "[S1] David Foot\n\n\n# David Foot\n\n\n\n**David K. [S2] Foot** is a Canadian economist and demographer. [S3] Foot did his undergraduate work at the University of Western Australia and his graduate work in economics at Harvard University, where he was supervised by Martin Feldstein. [S4] Following his PhD, he joined the department of economics at the University of Toronto. [S5] ## Economic demographics\n\nAfter some early works on macroeconometrics, Foot turned his attention to economic demography. [S6] His research focuses on the impact of demographics on economics, especially as pertaining to the aging of the baby boomers. [S7] He argues that demographic shifts tend to have important social and economic consequences that are often neglected by policy makers, including aspects such as the changing patterns in crime, leisure activities and school enrollment. [S8] In his own words, demographics explains \"two-thirds of everything\". [S9] A non-technical summary of his research on Canadian demographics was presented in his 1996 book Boom Bust & Echo: How to Profit from the Coming Demographic Shift, co-authored with journalist Daniel Stoffman. [S10] The book went on to become a Canadian national bestseller, and Foot has taken an active role in debates concerning Canadian public policies. [S11] ## Selected readings\n\n* David K.
