      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the main and relief presenters of the India Business Report and which former presenters are explicitly mentioned with their roles.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the supporting context provided. The passage starts by mentioning that the show is presented by Yogita Limaye. Then there's a section titled \"Presenters\" with a table. In that table, Yogita Limaye is listed as the Main Presenter, and Shilpa Kannan as Relief Presenters. Sameer Hashmi's role isn't filled in, so I can ignore that.\n\nNext, under \"Former presenters,\" there's a list. The names are Karishma Vaswani, Rajini Vaidyanathan (Relief Presenter), Nidhi Dutt, and Delnaaz Irani. The parentheses around \"Relief Presenter\" for Rajini indicate her role. The others don't have roles specified, so they might not be relevant here.\n\nThe question also asks for former presenters explicitly mentioned with their roles. So Rajini Vaidyanathan is the only one with a stated role. The others are just names without roles. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The main presenter is in S1 and S3. The relief presenter Shilpa Kannan is in S3. The former presenters are listed in the \"Former presenters\" section, which is part of S3 as well. Rajini's role is in the same section. \n\nSo the answer should state that Yogita Limaye was the main presenter and Shilpa Kannan the relief presenter. The former presenters mentioned with roles are Rajini Vaidyanathan as Relief Presenter. Citations would be S1, S3 for the main and relief, and S3 again for the former presenter with the role."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking two things: first, what information is provided about the final episode of the India Business Report, and second, who the primary presenter was during its run.\n\nLooking at the supporting context, the passage starts by introducing the show, stating it's a weekly program produced by the BBC, shown on BBC World News, and presented by Yogita Limaye. That's in sentence S1. Then, in S2, it mentions that the last episode aired on 3 April 2016. So that's the info about the final episode. \n\nNext, under the \"Presenters\" section, there's a table. The main presenter is listed as Yogita Limaye, and the relief presenters include Shilpa Kannan and Sameer Hashmi. The former presenters are listed below, but the question is about the primary presenter during its run. Since Yogita Limaye is listed as the main presenter in the table, that's the answer. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information conflicting. The schedule part doesn't mention presenters, so the key sentences are S1, S2, and the table under S3. The primary presenter is Yogita Limaye, cited from S1 and S3. The final episode date is S2. So the answer should combine these points with the correct citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the schedule for the India Business Report accounts for time zone differences and the specific times for Sundays in both GMT and UTC+05:30.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the schedule in a table. Let me check the relevant sentences. \n\nLooking at the passage, sentence S3 is the start of the \"Schedule\" section. The table under that shows the times for different days. For Sunday, the GMT time is 05:30 and UTC+05:30 is 11:00. The note about \"16:30 (except for Europe)\" might be for other days, but the question is specifically about Sundays. \n\nThe user also asks how the schedule accounts for time zones. The table itself shows the two time zones, GMT and UTC+05:30, so that's the method. The specific times for Sunday are 05:30 GMT and 11:00 UTC+05:30. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. The rest of the passage talks about presenters and the end date, which isn't relevant here. So the answer should reference the table in S3. The citations would be [S3] for the schedule information. \n\nWait, the user might be confused about the \"except for Europe\" note. But since the question is about Sundays, and the table lists Sunday's times as 05:30 and 11:00, that's the key part. The other times in the table (like 16:30) are for other days, maybe? The question is only about Sundays, so those other times aren't needed here. \n\nSo the answer is straightforward: the schedule uses a table with GMT and UTC+05:30 times, and for Sunday, it's 05:30 GMT and 11:00 UTC+05:30. The citation is S3."

The user is asking about the details of the production and cancellation of the India Business Report and the presenters associated with its final broadcast.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let's go sentence by sentence.\n\n[S1] mentions that the India Business Report is a weekly business news program produced by the BBC, shown on BBC World News, and presented by Yogita Limaye. That gives some production details. \n\n[S2] states that the last episode aired on 3 April 2016. That's the cancellation detail. \n\n[S3] starts with \"## Presenters\" and has a table. The main presenter is Yogita Limaye, and there are relief presenters like Shilpa Kannan and Sameer Hashmi. Then there's a section on former presenters, including Karishma Vaswani, Rajini Vaidyanathan, Nidhi Dutt, and Delnaaz Irani. \n\nThe schedule section might not be directly relevant to the cancellation or presenters, but the question is about the final broadcast's presenters. The main presenter listed is Yogita Limaye, and the relief presenters are Shilpa Kannan and Sameer Hashmi. However, the former presenters are listed separately, so they might not be part of the final broadcast. \n\nSo, the production details are in S1, the cancellation (last episode) in S2. The presenters for the final broadcast would be Yogita Limaye as main, and Shilpa Kannan and Sameer Hashmi as relief. The former presenters might not be part of the final one. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The production details in S1, cancellation in S2, and presenters in S3. The table under S3 is part of the presenters section. So the presenters' names would be cited from S3. The former presenters are also in S3, but the question is about the final broadcast, so maybe only the current ones listed in the Presenters table. \n\nSo the answer should mention the production by BBC, last episode on 3 April 2016, and presenters Yogita Limaye, Shilpa Kannan, and Sameer Hashmi. Citations would be [S1][S2][S3]."
