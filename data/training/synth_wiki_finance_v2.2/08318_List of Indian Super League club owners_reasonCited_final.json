      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which current Indian Super League club's ownership includes a Bollywood actor and a cricketer, and also wants to know the source of wealth for the majority owner of that club.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage lists the current clubs and their owners. Let me check each club's owner information.\n\nStarting with Bengaluru: owned by JSW Group. No Bollywood or cricketer mentioned here. Next, Chennaiyin. The owners are Abhishek Bachchan, MS Dhoni, and Vita Dani. Abhishek Bachchan is a Bollywood actor, and MS Dhoni is a cricketer. That fits the first part of the question. \n\nNow, the second part: the source of wealth for the majority owner. The table says the source of wealth for Chennaiyin is \"Asian Paints Jaipur Pink Panthers Investments\". But wait, the majority owner here might be the group as a whole. However, the question specifies the majority owner. But the table lists multiple owners. However, the estimated combined net worth is $2.74B. But the source of wealth is listed as Asian Paints and Jaipur Pink Panthers Investments. So maybe the majority owner's source is Asian Paints? Or is that the source for the group?\n\nAlternatively, looking at other clubs. For example, Mumbai City has City Football Group and Ranbir Kapoor. Ranbir is a Bollywood actor, but no cricketer. Goa has Virat Kohli (cricketer) and Akshay Tandon. But Akshay Tandon isn't a Bollywood actor. Wait, Akshay Tandon is a businessman, maybe? Not sure. But the question mentions a Bollywood actor and a cricketer. So Chennaiyin's owners include Abhishek Bachchan (Bollywood) and MS Dhoni (cricketer). That seems to fit.\n\nSo the club is Chennaiyin. Now, the source of wealth for the majority owner. The table lists \"Asian Paints Jaipur Pink Panthers Investments\" as the source. But who is the majority owner? The owners are Abhishek Bachchan, MS Dhoni, and Vita Dani. But the source of wealth is listed as Asian Paints and Jaipur Pink Panthers. Maybe the majority owner is Abhishek Bachchan, but his source of wealth is not explicitly stated here. Wait, the table's \"Source of wealth\" column is for the owner(s). So for Chennaiyin, the source is Asian Paints (which is a company, possibly owned by someone) and Jaipur Pink Panthers Investments. But the majority owner might be Abhishek Bachchan, but the source here is listed as Asian Paints. However, the question asks for the source of wealth for the majority owner. If the majority owner is part of the group, maybe the source is Asian Paints. But I need to check the citations. The source is cited as [S2] and [S3]? Wait, the passage's context has the table with sources. Let me check the original passage again.\n\nLooking at the passage, the table for Chennaiyin has \"Source of wealth\" as \"Asian Paints Jaipur Pink Panthers Investments\". The citations for the table are [S3] for the current clubs section. But the specific row for Chennaiyin might not have individual citations. However, the passage's structure has the table under \"Current clubs\" which is [S3]. But the exact source for Chennaiyin's wealth is in the table's row. The user's question requires citations. The answer would need to cite the source where the information is found. Since the table is under [S3], but each row's data is part of that section. However, the exact source for the wealth might be in the table's data. But the user's supporting context might not have more specific citations. So the answer would cite [S3] for the club information and [S2] for the estimated net worth and source of wealth. Wait, the passage's [S2] says \"Some owners have significant interest in the club, estimated net worth and source of wealth.\" So the source of wealth information is part of the table under [S3]. Therefore, the citation for the source of wealth would be [S3]. But the user might need to check the exact sentence. However, in the passage, the table's data is under [S3], so the answer would cite [S3] for the source of wealth. \n\nSo the answer is Chennaiyin FC, owned by Abhishek Bachchan (Bollywood) and MS Dhoni (cricketer), with the source of wealth being Asian Paints and Jaipur Pink Panthers Investments. The citations would be [S3] for the club details and [S2] for the general info. But the exact source of wealth is in the table under [S3]. So the citations would be [S3] for the club's source of wealth. Also, the question mentions \"majority owner\". However, the table lists multiple owners. If the majority owner is part of the group, but the source is listed as Asian Paints, which might be the source for the group. So the answer would be based on the table's data under [S3]."
