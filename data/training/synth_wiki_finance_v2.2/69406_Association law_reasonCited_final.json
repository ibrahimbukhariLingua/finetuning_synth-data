[S2] This includes charitable organizations, which are generally classified under 501(c)3 in the IRS Tax Code, professional societies, guilds and trade associations, which are classified under 501(c)6, and homeowner associations, which are classified under 501(c)4. [S3] There are other classification types, but these are the primary ones. [S4] The activities allowed by the IRS vary for each type of association. [S5] For example, trade associations are allowed to do political lobbying, but charitable organizations are not. [S6] There are nuances to both of these, but the idea is to ensure that each type of organization has guidelines for its activities which match the purpose and mission of the nonprofit.

[S8] Here is the summary published by the IRS for the 501(c)3 classification:\nTo be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. [S9] In addition, it may not be an action organization, i.e., it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates. [S10] Organizations described in section 501(c)(3) are commonly referred to as charitable organizations. [S11] Organizations described in section 501(c)(3), other than testing for public safety organizations, are eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions in accordance with Code section 170. [S12] The organization must not be organized or operated for the benefit of private interests, and no part of a section 501(c)(3) organization's net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. [S13] If the organization engages in an excess benefit transaction with a person having substantial influence over the organization, an excise tax may be imposed on the person and any organization managers agreeing to the transaction.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the IRS classification requirements for 501(c)(3) organizations interact with state statutes governing associations, specifically Florida's laws on developer responsibilities and transfer of control.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions that 501(c)(3) organizations have specific IRS requirements, like being exclusively for exempt purposes and not engaging in political lobbying. Then, there's a section about Florida's statutes, like Ch. 718, 719, 720, and 721, which govern different types of associations. \n\nThe user is interested in the interaction between these federal IRS rules and state laws. The passage talks about how associations are registered as not-for-profits and are governed by state statutes. For example, in Florida, there are specific laws about developer responsibilities, such as transferring control once a certain sales percentage is reached. \n\nI need to check if there are any direct mentions of how IRS requirements conflict or align with these state laws. The passage states that associations are subject to state statutes, so compliance with both federal and state laws is necessary. However, the IRS classification (like 501(c)(3)) would require certain activities and restrictions, while state laws might have different requirements, like transfer of control or financial audits. \n\nLooking at the citations, S18-S22 discuss state laws and how associations are governed by them. S28-S37 mention Florida's specific statutes, like the Condominium Act and transfer of control requirements. The IRS requirements are in S1-S17, detailing 501(c)(3) rules. \n\nSo, the interaction would involve 501(c)(3) organizations needing to comply with both their IRS restrictions (like no political lobbying) and state laws (like developer transfer of control). The answer should note that while IRS rules focus on tax-exempt status and activities, state laws handle specific governance and developer responsibilities. There's no direct conflict mentioned, but they operate in different areas. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sections. For example, stating that IRS requirements are separate from state statutes but both apply. Then, mention specific Florida laws and how they interact. Make sure each statement has the correct citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the legal obligations on developers regarding financial audits and transfer of control, and how these relate to the tax-exempt status of 501(c)(3) associations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning each section.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a lot about 501(c)(3) organizations, their tax-exempt status, and restrictions on their activities. But I need to check if there's anything about developers' obligations. The first part of Passage 1 talks about different types of associations, like 501(c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(6), but not directly about developers. Then, in Passage 2, there's more info. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, specifically sentences S28 to S49. Sentence S32 mentions that once the developer reaches a certain sales percentage, they must transfer control to owners, including delivering financial records. That's about transfer of control. Then S33 and S34 refer to Florida Statute 718.301(1) about transferring control. \n\nThen S38 talks about financial requirements, and gives examples like Fla. Stat. sec. 718.301(4)(c) which mentions a 90-day deadline for an independent audit after control transfer. Also, S42-44 mention developer warranties and other statutes. \n\nSo the financial audit obligation is tied to the transfer of control. The transfer of control requires the developer to hand over financial records and undergo an audit. But how does this relate to tax-exempt status? The question connects these obligations to 501(c)(3) associations. \n\nWait, the passages mention 501(c)(3) in Passage 1, but the transfer of control and audits are in Passage 2, which seems to be about homeowner associations, which are under 501(c)(4) according to S2. However, the user is asking about 501(c)(3). Maybe there's a connection through the tax-exempt status. \n\nThe tax-exempt status of 501(c)(3) requires that they don't have earnings inuring to private individuals, and have restrictions on political activities. But the developer's obligations here are more about transfer of control and audits, which might be part of ensuring the association's proper governance, which in turn affects their tax-exempt status. For example, if the association isn't properly managed, it might lose its tax-exempt status. \n\nBut the passages don't explicitly link the financial audit requirements to 501(c)(3) status. They mention 501(c)(3) in the context of charitable organizations, but the transfer of control and audits are in the context of homeowner associations (which are 501(c)(4)). However, the user is asking about the relation to 501(c)(3). Maybe the answer is that the obligations (audits, transfer of control) are part of ensuring the association's compliance with tax laws, which is necessary for maintaining tax-exempt status. \n\nSo, the legal obligations on developers include transferring control to owners once a certain sales threshold is met, which involves transferring financial records and undergoing an audit. These obligations ensure that the association is properly governed, which is important for maintaining their tax-exempt status under 501(c)(3) or other sections. However, the passages don't directly state this connection, so I have to be careful. \n\nThe answer should cite the relevant sentences from the passage. For the financial audits, S38 and S42-44. For transfer of control, S32 and S33. The relation to tax-exempt status might be inferred from the general requirements of 501(c)(3) in Passage 1, like ensuring no private inurement, but the direct link isn't explicit. So maybe the answer is that the obligations ensure proper financial management, which is necessary for maintaining tax-exempt status, but the passages don't explicitly state this. \n\nTherefore, the answer would state the obligations (transfer of control and audits) with citations, and note that the tax-exempt status requirements (like no private inurement) are in the passages, but the direct relation isn't explicitly mentioned. However, the user might expect that the transfer of control and audits are part of the compliance needed for tax-exempt status. So I'll structure the answer with the obligations and their citations, and mention the tax-exempt status in the context of the general requirements from the first passage."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key legal requirements for associations transitioning from developer control to owner control, and how these requirements ensure compliance with federal tax regulations and state laws.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts. Let me go through each section carefully.\n\nStarting with Passage 1: It talks about association law, different tax classifications like 501(c)(3), 501(c)(6), and 501(c)(4). It mentions that associations must comply with IRS regulations, such as not engaging in political lobbying (for 501(c)(3)) and ensuring that earnings don't benefit private individuals. There's also mention of state laws, like Florida's specific statutes for different types of associations (Condominium Act, Homeowner Associations, etc.). \n\nThen in Passage 2: It discusses deed restrictions, compliance with state statutes, and the transition of control from developers to owners. Specifically, it states that when a developer reaches a certain sales percentage, they must transfer control, including board majority and financial records. There are citations to Florida statutes like 718.301(1) and others related to audits and warranties. Also, after transition, the board must evaluate matters with expert advice.\n\nNow, the question is about the legal requirements during the transition. From the context, key points include transferring control (board majority, financial records), compliance with state laws (like Florida's chapters 718-721), and federal tax compliance (IRS classifications, no private inurement, lobbying restrictions). \n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. For example, the transfer of control is mentioned in S32 and S33. The IRS requirements are in S1-S17. State laws are in S22, S23-S27. Also, the financial audits and warranties are in S38-S44. \n\nI should structure the answer by listing the key requirements and their citations, then explain how they ensure compliance with both federal and state laws. Each statement should have the relevant citations. Need to check if each citation is correctly placed. For instance, the transition requirements are in S32 and S33, and the state laws in S22 and the Florida statutes. Federal tax aspects are in the first passage, especially S1-S17. \n\nMake sure not to miss any important points. Also, check that each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Avoid combining multiple points into one sentence unless they are directly related. Ensure that the answer clearly links the requirements to compliance with both federal and state laws."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the consequences of non-compliance with deed restrictions and state statutes, and how they relate to the IRS's requirements for tax-exempt organizations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the sections mentioned. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a lot about association law, different IRS classifications like 501(c)(3), 501(c)(6), and 501(c)(4). The IRS requirements are discussed, such as not engaging in political lobbying and not allowing earnings to inure to private individuals. But the question is about consequences of non-compliance with deed restrictions and state statutes, and their relation to IRS requirements.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's more about deed restrictions. Sentence [S28] mentions deed restrictions apply via recorded documents. [S29] says associations and owners are subject to state statutes. [S30] states that non-compliance can be enforced by court or arbitration unless invalid. But how does this tie into IRS requirements?\n\nThe IRS requirements are about tax-exempt status. If an organization doesn't comply with IRS rules, like engaging in prohibited activities, they might lose their tax-exempt status. But the passage doesn't explicitly link state statutes or deed restrictions to IRS requirements. However, maybe there's an indirect connection. For example, if a homeowner association (which might be a 501(c)(4)) doesn't follow state laws, that could affect their compliance with IRS regulations. But the passage doesn't explicitly state that. \n\nWait, the question is about consequences of non-compliance with deed restrictions and state statutes, and how they relate to IRS requirements. The passage mentions that associations are subject to state statutes (S29) and that non-compliance can be enforced (S30). But the IRS requirements are in Passage 1, like 501(c)(3) rules. However, the connection isn't directly made in the text. \n\nSo, the answer would need to state that non-compliance with deed restrictions and state statutes can lead to legal enforcement (citations S28, S29, S30). As for the relation to IRS requirements, the passage doesn't explicitly link them, but maybe if the association is tax-exempt (like 501(c)(4)), they must comply with both state laws and IRS rules. However, the text doesn't explicitly say that. So perhaps the answer is that the consequences are legal enforcement, and the relation is that tax-exempt organizations must comply with both, but the passage doesn't directly connect them. \n\nBut the user wants citations. So the first part would cite S28, S29, S30. The second part about IRS might not have direct citations. But maybe the IRS requirements are in Passage 1, like S8-S17. However, the question is how they relate. Since the passage doesn't explicitly state the relation, maybe the answer is that the consequences are legal enforcement, and the IRS requirements are separate but both must be followed. But without explicit citations, maybe the second part doesn't have citations. \n\nSo the final answer would have two statements: one about consequences with citations, and another about the relation, which might not have citations. But I need to check if there's any mention of the relation. Let me check again. \n\nIn Passage 1, it says that associations are governed by tax codes and state statutes. But no direct link between non-compliance with state statutes and IRS requirements. So maybe the answer is that non-compliance with deed restrictions and state statutes can lead to legal enforcement (citations S28, S29, S30), and the IRS requirements are separate but tax-exempt organizations must comply with both. However, since the passage doesn't explicitly state the relation, the second part might not have citations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRS requirements are part of the association's compliance, so if they don't follow state laws, they might not meet IRS criteria. But the passage doesn't say that. So I should stick to what's in the text. Therefore, the answer would have the first part with citations, and the second part without, or maybe with some citations from the IRS section. But the question is about how they relate. Since the passage doesn't explicitly connect them, perhaps the answer is that the consequences are legal enforcement, and the relation is that tax-exempt organizations must comply with both, but no specific citations for the relation part."

    "[S1] Association law\n\n\n# Association law\n\n\n\n**Association law** is a term used in the United States for the law governing not-for-profit corporations under various tax codes. [S2] This includes charitable organizations, which are generally classified under 501(c)3 in the IRS Tax Code, professional societies, guilds and trade associations, which are classified under 501(c)6, and homeowner associations, which are classified under 501(c)4. [S3] There are other classification types, but these are the primary ones. [S4] The activities allowed by the IRS vary for each type of association. [S5] For example, trade associations are allowed to do political lobbying, but charitable organizations are not. [S6] There are nuances to both of these, but the idea is to ensure that each type of organization has guidelines for its activities which match the purpose and mission of the nonprofit. [S7] There are other differences, as well, which can be learned through research on the American Society of Association Executives (asaecenter.org) or other association-focused resources. [S8] Here is the summary published by the IRS for the 501(c)3 classification:\nTo be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. [S9] In addition, it may not be an action organization, i.e., it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates. [S10] Organizations described in section 501(c)(3) are commonly referred to as charitable organizations. [S11] Organizations described in section 501(c)(3), other than testing for public safety organizations, are eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions in accordance with Code section 170. [S12] The organization must not be organized or operated for the benefit of private interests, and no part of a section 501(c)(3) organization's net earnings may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. [S13] If the organization engages in an excess benefit transaction with a person having substantial influence over the organization, an excise tax may be imposed on the person and any organization managers agreeing to the transaction. [S14] Section 501(c)(3) organizations are restricted in how much political and legislative (lobbying) activities they may conduct. [S15] For a detailed discussion, see Political and Lobbying Activities. [S16] For more information about lobbying activities by charities, see the article Lobbying Issues; for more information about political activities of charities, see the FY-2002 CPE topic Election Year Issues. [S17] 501(c)4 - Homeowners Associations and Related Similar Nonprofits\n\nReal estate developers often choose to maximize residential construction to clusters of residences within real property parcels. [S18] Many people purchase their residence within an association for reasons such as location along beaches and other areas, amenities, uniformity of appearance and other particular benefits or reasons. [S19] Associations are registered by the developer of the community as a not-for-profit corporation, which form of corporation is also governed by particular statutes. [S20] The legal forms of residential associations include homeowner associations, condominium associations, cooperative associations and mobile home associations. [S21] Thus, state laws are enacted to address specific types of associations applicable to the type of communities and relationships between the governing association and its constituents. [S22] ## Florida law\n\nIn Florida there are statutes under Ch. [S23] 718, *The Condominium Act*, Ch. [S24] 719, regarding Co-Operative ownership, Ch. [S25] 720, governing Homeowner Associations, and Ch. [S26] 721, controlling laws for Mobile Homes. [S27] The laws for such associations continually evolve to address important legal and socioeconomic matters.",
    "[S28] Deed restrictions apply to purchasers of residential interests within such communities pursuant to a recorded Declaration, By-Laws, Covenants and Restrictions and/or Rules and Regulations for the particular community. [S29] Associations and all owners therein are subject to state statutes enacted for the particular form of community. [S30] Thus, compliance with such restrictions is mandatory and will be enforce by an applicable court of law and/or arbitration unless such restrictions are declared to be invalid or otherwise illegal. [S31] Associations are also required to comply with applicable laws concerning structural and other components of the condominium or other applicable building to help ensure the safety of owners. [S32] Once the developer arrives at a certain percentage of sales or permanent leasing of units within the association, the developer is statutorily required to transfer control of the association to owners other than the developer including control of a majority of the board of directors and delivery of financial records, all association records and all association property. [S33] *E.g.*, Fla. [S34] Stat. [S35] sec. [S36] 718.301(1). [S37] Particular laws apply to financial requirements, construction defects and other matters concerning the developer of associations with applicable deadlines and various statutes of limitations. [S38] *E.g.*, Fla. [S39] Stat. [S40] sec. [S41] 718.301(4)(c)(90-day deadline following turnover of control for the developer of a condominium to pay for and provide an independent audit of the financial records); *e.g.*, Fla. [S42] Stat. [S43] sec. [S44] 718.203(developer warranties). [S45] Even a conversion of an older building to condominium can subject the developer to providing warranties to its owners. [S46] *E.g.*, 718.618(6). [S47] Thus, following the transition of the association from the developer to unit owners other than the developer, the board of directors has the exceedingly important task of timely evaluating same through expert and legal advice. [S48] There is a growing trend for developers to choose to construct or convert buildings to non-residential commercial offices. [S49] One of the reasons for this growth in popularity is that the residential market is cooling with slower sales, high levels of investment ownership and high levels of supply."
