      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the evidence in the source that indicates the subcommittee's role in addressing systemic issues like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reforms and how that was reflected in its structure.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The passage mentions the U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance. There's a section about its jurisdiction, where it says the subcommittee oversees the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Ginnie Mae. But the key part might be in the history of the subcommittee's name changes and jurisdiction shifts.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a mention that between 2019 and 2013, it was called the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance. Then, there's a part about the jurisdiction over insurance being transferred in 2001 to the House Banking and Financial Services Committee. But later, because of plans to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, insurance was moved to a new Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity as of the 112th Congress. \n\nWait, the 112th Congress is around 2011-2013. The passage says that the subcommittee's agenda included Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reforms, leading to the creation of a new subcommittee. This suggests that the original subcommittee's structure was adjusted to handle these systemic issues by splitting responsibilities. \n\nAlso, the current structure in the 119th Congress includes members like Mike Flood and Monica De La Cruz as chair and vice chair, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, the key evidence is in the part where it mentions the transfer of insurance jurisdiction and the creation of a new subcommittee focused on insurance, housing, and community opportunity due to the reforms. \n\nSo the evidence is in sentences S8 and S7. Sentence S8 talks about moving insurance to a new subcommittee because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reforms. Sentence S7 mentions the transfer of insurance jurisdiction in 2001, which might be part of the structural changes. Also, the name change in S3 might indicate the evolving focus. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The answer should connect the subcommittee's role in reforms to the structural changes like the creation of a new subcommittee and jurisdiction shifts."
