      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the current board members of Localis and the notable roles of former chief executives before their tenure there.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage for the current board members. Scanning through the sentences, I see in [S7] that the current board members are listed: Sir Merrick Cockell (chairman), Councillor Paul Carter, Councillor Paul Bettison, Councillor Louise Goldsmith, and Councillor David Renard. That answers the first part.\n\nNext, the former chief executives. The passage mentions James Morris in [S8], who was elected as an MP for Halesowen and Rowley Regis in May 2010. Then, Liam Booth-Smith took over in 2016 [S9], and Jonathan Werran replaced him in 2018 [S10]. The question is about their notable roles prior to their tenure at Localis. \n\nFor James Morris, the citation [S8] states his election as an MP. The other former CEOs, Booth-Smith and Werran, aren't mentioned with prior roles in the given text. So only James Morris has a prior role noted. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. Checking again, the passage doesn't provide prior roles for Booth-Smith or Werran. So the answer should list the current board members from [S7] and the former CEO's prior role from [S8]. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with the correct citations. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with citations in <cite>. The current members are in one sentence with [S7], and the former CEO's role in another with [S8]. No other citations are needed. Let me put that together."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the 'Rate Escape' report in Localis's advocacy for local financial autonomy and which prominent figures endorsed its recommendations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find mentions of the 'Rate Escape' report. Scanning through, I see a section titled \"*The Rate Escape: Freeing Local Government to Drive Economic Growth*\" under the Notable publications section. \n\nThe relevant sentences here are [S17] to [S20]. Sentence [S17] states that the report argued for local government to retain business rates, which is directly about financial autonomy. That's the significance part. Then, [S18] mentions that the report attracted support from prominent figures. The next sentences [S19] list Bob Neill and Miles Templeman's endorsements. Additionally, [S20] notes George Osborne's announcement in 2015 about councils keeping business rates, which aligns with the report's recommendations.\n\nSo, the significance is the push for retaining business rates to give local governments more financial control. The endorsers are Bob Neill, Miles Templeman, and George Osborne. I need to check if all these are correctly cited. The sentences [S17] explains the report's argument, [S18] mentions the support, [S19] has the quotes from Neill and Templeman, and [S20] mentions Osborne. \n\nI should structure the answer with two statements: one explaining the significance citing [S17], and another about the endorsers citing [S18][S19][S20]. Wait, but [S20] is about Osborne's announcement, which is a result of the report, not necessarily an endorsement. The question asks for who endorsed the recommendations. The passage says the report \"attracted support from a range of prominent figures\" and then lists Neill and Templeman. Osborne's action might be a policy adoption rather than an endorsement. So maybe only Neill and Templeman are direct endorsers. But the user might consider Osborne as well. Need to check the exact wording. The passage says Osborne \"called it 'the biggest transfer of power'\" which is a positive statement, but not explicitly an endorsement. However, since the report's recommendations were implemented, maybe he's considered an endorser. But the text doesn't explicitly say he endorsed it, just that he announced the policy. So perhaps only Neill and Templeman are cited as endorsers. \n\nSo the answer would be: The 'Rate Escape' report's significance is in advocating for local financial autonomy through retaining business rates (cite [S17]). Prominent figures endorsing include Bob Neill and Miles Templeman (cite [S18][S19]). George Osborne's mention in [S20] is about policy implementation, not direct endorsement. But the question says \"endorsed its recommendations,\" so maybe Osborne is included if his actions are seen as endorsing. The passage says he \"called it 'the biggest transfer of power'\" which is a positive endorsement. So maybe include [S20] as well. \n\nTherefore, the citations for the endorsers would be [S18][S19][S20]. But need to check if [S20] is about endorsement. The exact wording in the passage: \"George Osborne announced that English councils would be able to keep all of the proceedings from business rates, calling it 'the biggest transfer of power' in recent history.\" So he's citing the report's impact, but not necessarily endorsing it. However, since the report's recommendations were the basis for his policy, it's reasonable to include him. The user might expect that. So the answer would include all three. \n\nSo the final answer would have two statements: one on significance with [S17], and one on endorsers with [S18][S19][S20]."
