      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Western Refining\n\n\n# Western Refining\n\n\n\n**Western Refining, Inc.**, is a Texas-based Fortune 200 and Global 2000 crude oil refiner and marketer operating primarily in the Southwestern, North-Central and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. [S2] Western Refining (WNR) has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since January 2006 and is the fourth largest publicly traded independent refiner and marketer in the nation. [S3] The company is headquartered in El Paso, Texas; its refineries are located in El Paso, Gallup, New Mexico, and St. [S4] Paul Park, Minnesota. [S5] These refineries have a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550\u00a0m\u00b3/d). [S6] A majority of products produced at these refineries are light products, consisting of gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. [S7] All three refineries have truck loading terminals. [S8] The El Paso refinery delivers to a number of other markets via pipeline. [S9] Western Refining owns and operates a wholesale division that works in conjunction with the refining operations. [S10] Through the refineries and these affiliated companies, Western Refining serves a broad customer base in Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, northern Chihuahua, Mexico, and the central East Coast region. [S11] In late 2016, it was announced that the San Antonio, Texas based refining and logistics company Tesoro, renamed to Andeavor, would purchase Western Refining for an estimated enterprise value of $6.4 Billion. [S12] Stockholders from both companies approved the proposed deal on March 24, 2017, pending approval from the Federal Trade Commission. [S13] In 2017, Western Refining was acquired by Tesoro (another independent petroleum Refining and marketing corporation) and the combined company changed its name to Andeavor. [S14] Western is currently a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, after Marathon's acquisition of Andeavor in 2018. [S15] ## History\n\nThe El Paso refinery was originally two refineries across from each other on Trowbridge Avenue, one operated by Texaco, the other, larger, by Chevron Oil. [S16] In 1997 the company Refinery Holding was formed to manage the refineries; it purchased them outright in 2000. [S17] Western Refining purchased a pipeline system from Chevron capable of delivering 115,000 barrels of crude oil per day. [S18] In 2006 it became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. [S19] On August 28, 2006, Western Refining bought Giant Industries (GI) for $1.23 billion in cash, creating the fourth-largest publicly traded independent oil refiner in the USA. [S20] The combined company created the capacity to handle about 216,000 barrels a day from four refineries, about 84% more than Western's current capacity at the time. [S21] On November 12, 2013, Western acquired ACON Investments and TPG's ownership interests in Northern Tier Energy LP(NTI) for $775 million. [S22] This acquisition included the St. [S23] Paul Park Refinery which increased Western's refining barrel capacity by 89,500 barrels per day. [S24] It also acquired pipeline access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil plus product terminals, storage tanks, rail facilities and Mississippi river dockage. [S25] The company also gained ownership of retail assets that included SuperAmerica retail channel of 163 company operated and 74 franchised convenience stores. [S26] In addition to its refineries, Giant Industries, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned a crude-oil-gathering pipeline system based in Farmington, New Mexico, a fleet of crude-oil and finished-product truck transports and a chain of retail service stations and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. [S27] ## Current capacity\n\nPassage 2:\n[S28] The current capacity of the El Paso refinery is 128,000 barrels per day. [S29] An expansion is in the planning stages for 2013/2014 to increase capacity to 150,000 barrel per day. [S30] The refinery near Gallup, New Mexico, has a capacity of 26,000 barrels per day after an expansion during 2012. [S31] Western Refining also owns a refinery in Bloomfield, New Mexico, but it's currently closed. [S32] Western Refining sold the Yorktown terminal and refinery as well as a segment of an oil pipeline in New Mexico to subsidiaries of Plains All American Pipeline Co for approximately $220 million. [S33] The company retained its East Coast wholesale business and continued to market petroleum products in the Mid-Atlantic region, but focused its refining and most of its wholesale, retail, and marketing operations in the US Southwest. [S34] With the purchase of the St. [S35] Paul Park refinery, Western's total capacity is of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550\u00a0m\u00b3/d). [S36] ## Terminals and other locations\n\nWestern Refining has refined products terminals in Albuquerque and Bloomfield, New Mexico, and Yorktown, Virginia, asphalt terminals in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Albuquerque, and El Paso. [S37] It also has a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports, and wholesale petroleum products operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Maryland. [S38] ## Retail\n\nWestern owns and operates more than 260 convenience stores and gas stations located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. [S39] The company markets under its own brands of Giant, Mustang, Sundial, and (through Northern Tier Energy in the Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota) SuperAmerica, plus a number of locations feature the brands of other oil companies. [S40] They also license Western branded fuel to other retail stores. [S41] Western both purchases oil from the Mexican parastatal Pemex and sells refined oil products back to buyers in Mexico. [S42] ## Western Refining Logistics\n\nIn July 2013 Western Refining hoped to raise $287.5 million in a public stock offering for its recently formed pipeline and storage subsidiary, **Western Refining Logistics (WNRL)**. [S43] The subsidiary, formed as a limited partnership, will operate, develop, and acquire terminals, storage tanks, pipelines and other logistic assets, the company reported in a filing with the U.S. [S44] Securities and Exchange Commission. [S45] It now has 300 miles of crude oil pipelines and gathering systems, and storage and terminal facilities for crude oil and fuel in West Texas and New Mexico. [S46] The bulk of the money raised from the stock offering would go to the parent Western Refining to reimburse the company for the assets used to form the logistics company, Western reported in its filing. [S47] It would use $50 million of the money raised for general partnership purposes, it reported. [S48] The logistics company will initially get all revenue through a 10-year, fee-based agreement with the parent Western Refining for pipeline, terminal and storage services it reported. [S49] The fees are expected to total almost $120 million next year, or 92 percent of its forecasted annual revenues of almost $131 million.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the sequence of events that led to Western Refining's current ownership structure and which regulatory body's approval was needed for the acquisition by Tesoro.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find the relevant information. Let me scan through each sentence.\n\nStarting with the ownership structure: The passage mentions that in late 2016, Tesoro (later Andeavor) announced the purchase of Western Refining for $6.4 billion. Then, stockholders approved the deal in March 2017, pending FTC approval. In 2017, the acquisition happened, and the combined company became Andeavor. Then, in 2018, Marathon Petroleum acquired Andeavor, making Western a subsidiary of Marathon. So the sequence is: Tesoro's acquisition in 2016, approval in 2017, name change to Andeavor, then Marathon's acquisition in 2018.\n\nFor the regulatory body, sentence S12 mentions that the deal required approval from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). That's the key point here.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with the sequence of events and cite the relevant sentences. The events are: 2016 acquisition by Tesoro, 2017 stockholder approval pending FTC, 2017 name change to Andeavor, 2018 Marathon's acquisition. Citations would be S11 for the 2016 announcement, S12 for the FTC approval, S13 for the 2017 acquisition, and S14 for the Marathon acquisition. \n\nWait, let me check each part again. The question also asks for the regulatory body required for the acquisition by Tesoro. The answer is FTC, as per S12. The sequence is the acquisition announcement, approval process, name change, and then the later acquisition by Marathon. So the sentences to cite are S11, S12, S13, S14. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is correctly cited. Also, the user wants each sentence in <statement> tags with citations. So the answer should have multiple statements, each with their own citations. Let me structure that."

[S45] It now has 300 miles of crude oil pipelines and gathering systems, and storage and terminal facilities for crude oil and fuel in West Texas and New Mexico. [S46] The bulk of the money raised from the stock offering would go to the parent Western Refining to reimburse the company for the assets used to form the logistics company, Western reported in its filing. [S47] It would use $50 million of the money raised for general partnership purposes, it reported. [S48] The logistics company will initially get all revenue through a 10-year, fee-based agreement with the parent Western Refining for pipeline, terminal and storage services it reported. [S49] The fees are expected to total almost $120 million next year, or 92 percent of its forecasted annual revenues of almost $131 million."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of the St. Paul Park refinery acquisition on Western Refining's total crude oil processing capacity and the additional assets gained.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passages. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a mention under [S23] that the acquisition included the St. Paul Park Refinery, which increased Western's refining barrel capacity by 89,500 barrels per day. Then, in Passage 2, [S35] states that with the purchase of the St. Paul Park refinery, Western's total capacity is approximately 242,500 barrels per day. \n\nWait, but earlier in Passage 1, [S5] mentions the combined capacity of the refineries (including St. Paul Park) is 242,500 barrels per day. However, [S23] says the acquisition added 89,500 barrels per day. So maybe the previous capacity before the acquisition was 242,500 minus 89,500, which would be 153,000? But I need to check if that's accurate. However, the exact numbers might be in the text. \n\nAlso, the additional assets from the acquisition are mentioned in [S24], which includes pipeline access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil, plus product terminals, storage tanks, rail facilities, and Mississippi river dockage. Additionally, [S25] mentions gaining ownership of retail assets like SuperAmerica with 163 company-operated and 74 franchised convenience stores.\n\nSo the answer should state that the acquisition increased the total capacity by 89,500 barrels per day, bringing it to 242,500, and the additional assets include pipeline access, terminals, storage, rail, river dockage, and retail stores. The citations would be [S23][S24][S25], and [S35]. Wait, [S35] is about the total capacity after the acquisition. But the question is about the impact, so the increase is from [S23], and the total is [S35]. So the first part of the answer would cite [S23] and [S35], while the additional assets cite [S24] and [S25].\n\nI need to make sure each sentence has the correct citations. Let me structure the answer accordingly."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Western Refining\n\n\n# Western Refining\n\n\n\n**Western Refining, Inc.**, is a Texas-based Fortune 200 and Global 2000 crude oil refiner and marketer operating primarily in the Southwestern, North-Central and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. [S2] Western Refining (WNR) has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since January 2006 and is the fourth largest publicly traded independent refiner and marketer in the nation. [S3] The company is headquartered in El Paso, Texas; its refineries are located in El Paso, Gallup, New Mexico, and St. [S4] Paul Park, Minnesota. [S5] These refineries have a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550\u00a0m\u00b3/d). [S6] A majority of products produced at these refineries are light products, consisting of gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. [S7] All three refineries have truck loading terminals. [S8] The El Paso refinery delivers to a number of other markets via pipeline. [S9] Western Refining owns and operates a wholesale division that works in conjunction with the refining operations. [S10] Through the refineries and these affiliated companies, Western Refining serves a broad customer base in Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, northern Chihuahua, Mexico, and the central East Coast region. [S11] In late 2016, it was announced that the San Antonio, Texas based refining and logistics company Tesoro, renamed to Andeavor, would purchase Western Refining for an estimated enterprise value of $6.4 Billion. [S12] Stockholders from both companies approved the proposed deal on March 24, 2017, pending approval from the Federal Trade Commission. [S13] In 2017, Western Refining was acquired by Tesoro (another independent petroleum Refining and marketing corporation) and the combined company changed its name to Andeavor. [S14] Western is currently a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, after Marathon's acquisition of Andeavor in 2018. [S15] ## History\n\nThe El Paso refinery was originally two refineries across from each other on Trowbridge Avenue, one operated by Texaco, the other, larger, by Chevron Oil. [S16] In 1997 the company Refinery Holding was formed to manage the refineries; it purchased them outright in 2000. [S17] Western Refining purchased a pipeline system from Chevron capable of delivering 115,000 barrels of crude oil per day. [S18] In 2006 it became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. [S19] On August 28, 2006, Western Refining bought Giant Industries (GI) for $1.23 billion in cash, creating the fourth-largest publicly traded independent oil refiner in the USA. [S20] The combined company created the capacity to handle about 216,000 barrels a day from four refineries, about 84% more than Western's current capacity at the time. [S21] On November 12, 2013, Western acquired ACON Investments and TPG's ownership interests in Northern Tier Energy LP(NTI) for $775 million. [S22] This acquisition included the St. [S23] Paul Park Refinery which increased Western's refining barrel capacity by 89,500 barrels per day. [S24] It also acquired pipeline access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil plus product terminals, storage tanks, rail facilities and Mississippi river dockage. [S25] The company also gained ownership of retail assets that included SuperAmerica retail channel of 163 company operated and 74 franchised convenience stores. [S26] In addition to its refineries, Giant Industries, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned a crude-oil-gathering pipeline system based in Farmington, New Mexico, a fleet of crude-oil and finished-product truck transports and a chain of retail service stations and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. [S27] ## Current capacity\n\nPassage 2:\n[S28] The current capacity of the El Paso refinery is 128,000 barrels per day. [S29] An expansion is in the planning stages for 2013/2014 to increase capacity to 150,000 barrel per day. [S30] The refinery near Gallup, New Mexico, has a capacity of 26,000 barrels per day after an expansion during 2012. [S31] Western Refining also owns a refinery in Bloomfield, New Mexico, but it's currently closed. [S32] Western Refining sold the Yorktown terminal and refinery as well as a segment of an oil pipeline in New Mexico to subsidiaries of Plains All American Pipeline Co for approximately $220 million. [S33] The company retained its East Coast wholesale business and continued to market petroleum products in the Mid-Atlantic region, but focused its refining and most of its wholesale, retail, and marketing operations in the US Southwest. [S34] With the purchase of the St. [S35] Paul Park refinery, Western's total capacity is of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550\u00a0m\u00b3/d). [S36] ## Terminals and other locations\n\nWestern Refining has refined products terminals in Albuquerque and Bloomfield, New Mexico, and Yorktown, Virginia, asphalt terminals in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Albuquerque, and El Paso. [S37] It also has a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports, and wholesale petroleum products operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Maryland. [S38] ## Retail\n\nWestern owns and operates more than 260 convenience stores and gas stations located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. [S39] The company markets under its own brands of Giant, Mustang, Sundial, and (through Northern Tier Energy in the Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota) SuperAmerica, plus a number of locations feature the brands of other oil companies. [S40] They also license Western branded fuel to other retail stores. [S41] Western both purchases oil from the Mexican parastatal Pemex and sells refined oil products back to buyers in Mexico.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the purpose of Western Refining's 2013 stock offering for Western Refining Logistics and the percentage of projected annual revenues from the initial fee-based agreement with the parent company.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections. Let me scan through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section about Western Refining Logistics. Specifically, sentence S43 mentions that in July 2013, Western Refining aimed to raise $287.5 million through a public stock offering for its subsidiary, Western Refining Logistics (WNRL). The purpose here seems to be raising capital, probably to reimburse the parent company for assets used to form the logistics company. \n\nThen, in S47, it states that the money from the stock offering would go to the parent company to reimburse them for the assets used to form the logistics company. That answers the first part about the purpose. \n\nNext, the question asks about the percentage of projected annual revenues from the initial fee-based agreement. Looking at S49, it says the logistics company would initially get all revenue through a 10-year fee-based agreement with the parent, and the fees are expected to total almost $120 million next year, which is 92% of its forecasted annual revenues of almost $131 million. So the percentage is 92%.\n\nI need to make sure these sentences are correctly cited. The purpose is covered in S43 and S47, and the percentage in S49. Let me check if there are other sentences that might contribute. For example, S44 and S45 talk about the subsidiary being formed as a limited partnership and the SEC filing, but they don't directly answer the questions. The key points are in S43, S47, and S49.\n\nSo the answer should state that the purpose was to raise funds to reimburse the parent company for assets, and the percentage is 92% from the fee-based agreement. The citations would be [S43][S47] for the purpose and [S49] for the percentage."

[S24] It also acquired pipeline access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil plus product terminals, storage tanks, rail facilities and Mississippi river dockage. [S25] The company also gained ownership of retail assets that included SuperAmerica retail channel of 163 company operated and 74 franchised convenience stores. [S26] In addition to its refineries, Giant Industries, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned a crude-oil-gathering pipeline system based in Farmington, New Mexico, a fleet of crude-oil and finished-product truck transports and a chain of retail service stations and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. [S27] ## Current capacity",
        "[S28] The current capacity of the El Paso refinery is 128,000 barrels per day. [S29] An expansion is in the planning stages for 2013/2014 to increase capacity to 150,000 barrel per day. [S30] The refinery near Gallup, New Mexico, has a capacity of 26,000 barrels per day after an expansion during 2012. [S31] Western Refining also owns a refinery in Bloomfield, New Mexico, but it's currently closed. [S32] Western Refining sold the Yorktown terminal and refinery as well as a segment of an oil pipeline in New Mexico to subsidiaries of Plains All American Pipeline Co for approximately $220 million. [S33] The company retained its East Coast wholesale business and continued to market petroleum products in the Mid-Atlantic region, but focused its refining and most of its wholesale, retail, and marketing operations in the US Southwest. [S34] With the purchase of the St. [S35] Paul Park refinery, Western's total capacity is of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550\u00a0m\u00b3/d). [S36] ## Terminals and other locations\n\nWestern Refining has refined products terminals in Albuquerque and Bloomfield, New Mexico, and Yorktown, Virginia, asphalt terminals in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Albuquerque, and El Paso. [S37] It also has a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports, and wholesale petroleum products operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Maryland. [S38] ## Retail\n\nWestern owns and operates more than 260 convenience stores and gas stations located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. [S39] The company markets under its own brands of Giant, Mustang, Sundial, and (through Northern Tier Energy in the Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota) SuperAmerica, plus a number of locations feature the brands of other oil companies. [S40] They also license Western branded fuel to other retail stores. [S41] Western both purchases oil from the Mexican parastatal Pemex and sells refined oil products back to buyers in Mexico. [S42] ## Western Refining Logistics\n\nIn July 2013 Western Refining hoped to raise $287.5 million in a public stock offering for its recently formed pipeline and storage subsidiary, **Western Refining Logistics (WNRL)**. [S43] The subsidiary, formed as a limited partnership, will operate, develop, and acquire terminals, storage tanks, pipelines and other logistic assets, the company reported in a filing with the U.S. [S44] Securities and Exchange Commission. [S45] It now has 300 miles of crude oil pipelines and gathering systems, and storage and terminal facilities for crude oil and fuel in West Texas and New Mexico. [S46] The bulk of the money raised from the stock offering would go to the parent Western Refining to reimburse the company for the assets used to form the logistics company, Western reported in its filing. [S47] It would use $50 million of the money raised for general partnership purposes, it reported. [S48] The logistics company will initially get all revenue through a 10-year, fee-based agreement with the parent Western Refining for pipeline, terminal and storage services it reported. [S49] The fees are expected to total almost $120 million next year, or 92 percent of its forecasted annual revenues of almost $131 million."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the brands Western Refining uses for its retail operations and the regions served by its wholesale and marketing divisions.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passage to find relevant information. \n\nStarting with the brands for retail operations. In Passage 2, sentence S39 mentions that Western owns and operates more than 260 convenience stores and gas stations in certain states. Then, in S40, it says the company markets under its own brands of Giant, Mustang, Sundial, and SuperAmerica (through Northern Tier Energy in some regions). Also, there are other brands from other oil companies and licensed Western branded fuel. So the main brands here are Giant, Mustang, Sundial, and SuperAmerica. \n\nNow, for the regions served by wholesale and marketing divisions. Looking at S10, it mentions the wholesale division works with refining operations. Then S10 also says that through refineries and affiliated companies, they serve a broad customer base in several states and regions like Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, northern Chihuahua, Mexico, and the central East Coast. Additionally, S33 mentions they retained East Coast wholesale business and market in Mid-Atlantic. Also, S38 talks about wholesale operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Maryland. \n\nSo combining these, the regions are the Southwestern US (including Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, etc.), Mid-Atlantic, and parts of Mexico. The wholesale and marketing divisions serve those areas. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the brands, S39 and S40. For the regions, S10, S33, S38. Let me check again. \n\nYes, S10 mentions the customer base regions. S33 mentions East Coast and Mid-Atlantic. S38 lists the states. So the answer should list the brands and the regions with those citations."

    "[S1] Western Refining\n\n\n# Western Refining\n\n\n\n**Western Refining, Inc.**, is a Texas-based Fortune 200 and Global 2000 crude oil refiner and marketer operating primarily in the Southwestern, North-Central and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. [S2] Western Refining (WNR) has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since January 2006 and is the fourth largest publicly traded independent refiner and marketer in the nation. [S3] The company is headquartered in El Paso, Texas; its refineries are located in El Paso, Gallup, New Mexico, and St. [S4] Paul Park, Minnesota. [S5] These refineries have a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550\u00a0m\u00b3/d). [S6] A majority of products produced at these refineries are light products, consisting of gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. [S7] All three refineries have truck loading terminals. [S8] The El Paso refinery delivers to a number of other markets via pipeline. [S9] Western Refining owns and operates a wholesale division that works in conjunction with the refining operations. [S10] Through the refineries and these affiliated companies, Western Refining serves a broad customer base in Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, northern Chihuahua, Mexico, and the central East Coast region. [S11] In late 2016, it was announced that the San Antonio, Texas based refining and logistics company Tesoro, renamed to Andeavor, would purchase Western Refining for an estimated enterprise value of $6.4 Billion. [S12] Stockholders from both companies approved the proposed deal on March 24, 2017, pending approval from the Federal Trade Commission. [S13] In 2017, Western Refining was acquired by Tesoro (another independent petroleum Refining and marketing corporation) and the combined company changed its name to Andeavor. [S14] Western is currently a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, after Marathon's acquisition of Andeavor in 2018. [S15] ## History\n\nThe El Paso refinery was originally two refineries across from each other on Trowbridge Avenue, one operated by Texaco, the other, larger, by Chevron Oil. [S16] In 1997 the company Refinery Holding was formed to manage the refineries; it purchased them outright in 2000. [S17] Western Refining purchased a pipeline system from Chevron capable of delivering 115,000 barrels of crude oil per day. [S18] In 2006 it became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. [S19] On August 28, 2006, Western Refining bought Giant Industries (GI) for $1.23 billion in cash, creating the fourth-largest publicly traded independent oil refiner in the USA. [S20] The combined company created the capacity to handle about 216,000 barrels a day from four refineries, about 84% more than Western's current capacity at the time. [S21] On November 12, 2013, Western acquired ACON Investments and TPG's ownership interests in Northern Tier Energy LP(NTI) for $775 million. [S22] This acquisition included the St. [S23] Paul Park Refinery which increased Western's refining barrel capacity by 89,500 barrels per day. [S24] It also acquired pipeline access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil plus product terminals, storage tanks, rail facilities and Mississippi river dockage. [S25] The company also gained ownership of retail assets that included SuperAmerica retail channel of 163 company operated and 74 franchised convenience stores. [S26] In addition to its refineries, Giant Industries, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned a crude-oil-gathering pipeline system based in Farmington, New Mexico, a fleet of crude-oil and finished-product truck transports and a chain of retail service stations and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.
