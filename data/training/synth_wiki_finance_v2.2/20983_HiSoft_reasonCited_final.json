      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about HiSoft's key steps in their expansion and consolidation strategy between 2002 and 2012 and how these actions helped their position in the global outsourcing market.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me scan through each one to identify the relevant information.\n\nStarting with the history section. In 2002, HiSoft established a Japan-based subsidiary, which was later renamed. That's a key step in expansion. Then in 2004, they formed a Cayman Islands holding company with subsidiaries. That might be part of their consolidation strategy. \n\nIn 2010, they went public on NASDAQ, which is a significant milestone. The IPO would provide capital for further expansion. Then in 2011, they acquired NouvEON Technology Partners in the US. In 2012, they acquired BearingPoint Australia and merged with VanceInfo to form Pactera. These acquisitions and the merger are part of consolidation.\n\nLooking at the operations section, they expanded to the US, Singapore, and Japan through acquisitions, partnerships, and joint ventures. Also, their workforce grew, and they were listed on the Global Outsourcing 100 list, indicating their market position.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer. The key steps would be:\n\n1. Establishing a Japan subsidiary in 2002 (S5).\n2. Forming a Cayman Islands holding company in 2004 (S4).\n3. Acquiring NouvEON in 2011 (S8).\n4. Acquiring BearingPoint Australia in 2012 (S9).\n5. Merging with VanceInfo in 2012 (S3).\n6. Expanding through acquisitions and partnerships in the US, Singapore, Japan (S15).\n\nThese steps contributed to their global presence, increased market share, and recognition. The IPO in 2010 (S7) provided capital, and the acquisitions helped them enter new markets and strengthen their services. The merger with VanceInfo likely consolidated their position in the Chinese market. Their inclusion in the Global Outsourcing 100 list (S14) shows their established position.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the Japan subsidiary is S5, the Cayman Islands company is S4, the acquisitions are S8, S9, and the merger is S3. The expansion through acquisitions is S15. The IPO is S7. Also, the workforce growth and market position are in S13 and S14.\n\nI should check if all the relevant sentences are included and that the citations are accurate. Then structure each key step as a separate statement with the appropriate citations. Make sure not to miss any important points and that each part of the question is addressed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the financial milestones HiSoft achieved through its IPO and the investors who provided significant venture capital during its growth phase.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan each sentence for relevant information. \n\nStarting with the IPO milestones. Sentence S7 mentions the initial public offering (IPO) where HiSoft raised $64\u2013$74 million in American depositary shares on June 30, 2010, and that they became the 144th Chinese company listed on NASDAQ. That's a key financial milestone. So that's one point. \n\nNext, the question also asks about investors who gave significant venture capital. Looking at sentence S6, it lists several investors: Draper Fisher Jurvetson ePlanet Ventures, GGV Capital, GE Commercial Finance, International Finance Corporation, Intel Capital JAFCO Asia, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, and Sumitomo Corporation Equity Asia Limited. These are the venture capital firms mentioned, so that's the answer for the second part.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that mention additional milestones or investors. Checking the rest, S2 mentions the NASDAQ listing in 2010, but the specific financial details are in S7. The other sentences talk about mergers, acquisitions, and operations, which aren't directly related to the IPO milestones or VC funding. \n\nSo the answer should have two statements. The first citing S7 for the IPO details, and the second citing S6 for the investors. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with the appropriate citations. I need to format it correctly as per the instructions."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how HiSoft's workforce growth and inclusion in the Global Outsourcing 100 list reflect its operational scale and industry recognition during its active years.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me scan through them to find the relevant parts.\n\nThe question mentions two main points: workforce growth and inclusion in the Global Outsourcing 100 list. So I should find sentences that talk about these two aspects and how they relate to operational scale and industry recognition.\n\nLooking at the passage, sentence S13 mentions that HiSoft's workforce grew from about 3000 in 2007 to over 5000 in September 2010. That's a significant increase, which likely indicates operational scale. Then, sentence S14 states that HiSoft was the only Chinese company on the 2010 Global Outsourcing 100 list, which is a clear point about industry recognition. \n\nAdditionally, the Global Outsourcing 100 list inclusion (S14) shows industry recognition, and the workforce growth (S13) reflects operational scale. The user is asking how these two factors together show both operational scale and recognition. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that contribute. For example, S15 mentions the Global Outsourcing 100 list again, but it's redundant. The other sentences talk about acquisitions and operations, but the key ones are S13 and S14. \n\nSo the answer should connect the workforce growth (S13) to operational scale and the Global Outsourcing list (S14) to industry recognition. The citations would be [S13] and [S14]. \n\nI need to structure the answer into statements with proper citations. Each sentence in the answer should have its own <statement> tag and citations. Since the question is asking for how both factors reflect the aspects, maybe two separate statements: one for workforce growth and one for the list. \n\nWait, the user might want a single statement that combines both. But according to the response format, each sentence is a separate statement. So perhaps two statements: one explaining workforce growth and its relation to operational scale with citation S13, and another explaining the Global Outsourcing list and its relation to industry recognition with citation S14. \n\nAlternatively, if the answer can be in one sentence, but the example shows two sentences. Let me check the example given. The example has two sentences, each with their own citations. So maybe the answer should have two statements. \n\nSo the first statement would be about workforce growth reflecting operational scale, citing S13. The second statement would be about the Global Outsourcing 100 inclusion reflecting industry recognition, citing S14. \n\nI need to make sure that the answer is accurate and the citations are correctly placed. Also, check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. For instance, S15 mentions the Global Outsourcing 100 list again, but the exact wording in S14 is more direct. \n\nYes, S14 says \"HiSoft was the only Chinese company included on the 2010 Global Outsourcing 100 list...\" which directly answers the inclusion part. So S14 is the correct citation for that. \n\nTherefore, the answer should have two statements with citations [S13] and [S14]."
