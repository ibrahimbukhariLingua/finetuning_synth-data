      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Arjun Sethi (entrepreneur)\n\n\n# Arjun Sethi (entrepreneur)\n\n\n\n**Arjun Sethi** (born January 15, 1983) is an American internet entrepreneur, investor and executive. [S2] He is co-founder and partner at venture capital firm Tribe Capital. [S3] Previously, he was a partner at Social Capital and an executive at Yahoo!, where he launched Yahoo! [S4] Livetext. [S5] Prior, he was co-founder and CEO of MessageMe (acquired by Yahoo!) and was the CEO of Lolapps, the developer behind Ravenwood Fair. [S6] In December 2023, he became Tribe Capital's chairman and CIO. [S7] ## Career\n\n\n### Lolapps\n\nIn 2008, Sethi took the role as CEO of Lolapps, which developed social games on the Facebook platform. [S8] Lolapps developed Ravenwood Fair which had 10 million monthly active users. [S9] At its peak, Lolapps had 150 million monthly active users across its portfolio of games. [S10] Lolapps merged with game publisher 6waves in 2011 which made the merged entity 6waves Lolapps the second largest game publisher on Facebook measured by monthly active users after Zynga. [S11] Sethi became Chief Product Officer in 6waves Lolapps, which went on to raise $35 million in funding from Korean gaming company Nexon. [S12] In 2012, 6waves Lolapps laid off most of its development team and Sethi left to join venture capital firm Social Capital as an entrepreneur in residence. [S13] 6waves Lolapps subsequently rebranded itself as 6waves, dropping Lolapps from its name. [S14] In January 2022, Stillfront Group acquired 6waves for $201M. [S15] ### Angel investments\n\nSethi began angel investing at Lolapps. [S16] He is considered one of the top angel investors in Silicon Valley. [S17] His angel investments include Opendoor, Gusto and Long-Term Stock Exchange. [S18] ### MessageMe and Yahoo\n\nIn 2012, Sethi became co-founder and CEO of mobile messaging app MessageMe. [S19] MessageMe reached five million users within 75 days of launch. [S20] The company raised close to $12 million across two rounds of funding led by Greylock Partners. [S21] MessageMe's rapid growth led to Facebook revoking its access to the Facebook Platform\u2019s \u201cFind Friends\u201d functionality for competitive reasons. [S22] Leaked internal Facebook emails expressed concern about resulting negative publicity for Facebook, particularly given Sethi\u2019s relationship with Social Capital and previous position at Lolapps. [S23] Yahoo acquired MessageMe in 2014 for a price between $30 million and $40 million,\nshut down the app MessageMe, and put Sethi and the ex-MessageMe team to work on a Yahoo messaging app meant to compete with Snapchat and WhatsApp. [S24] Yahoo's acquisition of MessageMe was part of CEO Marissa Mayer's larger strategy to bring in new talent via small startup acquisitions. [S25] In 2015, Sethi and the former MessageMe team launched Yahoo! [S26] Livetext, an audio-free video messaging app. [S27] It never gained significant traction and Yahoo shut down the product in 2016. [S28] ### Social Capital\n\nIn early 2016, Sethi left Yahoo to join Social Capital as an investing partner focused on consumer startups. [S29] At Social Capital, Sethi backed the firm's investments in and served on the board of directors of Carta, Relativity Space, Cover, and CryptoMove. [S30] On February 8, 2024, he released Termina, an AI software platform for investors to perform quantitative due diligence on potential investments. [S31] The program is used by \"sovereign governments, sovereign wealth and pension funds, family offices and private fund managers.\"\n\n\n## Tribe Capital\n\nIn 2018, three former Social Capital investing partners, Sethi, Ted Maidenberg and Jonathan Hsu, left to form Tribe Capital with $200 million targeted for its first fund. [S32] Tribe invests in early-stage startups and uses quantitative data to inform investment decisions. [S33] Tribe raised $335 million for its second fund and $394 million for its third fund. [S34] As of December 2023, Tribe has approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, about 20% of which is invested in India.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S35] At Tribe, Sethi made its first investment in cryptocurrency trading platform SFOX. [S36] He also followed on to his investments in Carta, Relativity Space, and Cover. [S37] Other Tribe investments include FTX, Kraken, Applied Intuition, EquipmentShare, Pipe Technologies, Docker, Republic, Instabase, and Momentus. [S38] Sethi serves on the board of directors of Kraken and Docker. [S39] In 2020, Tribe launched its investing program Firstlook to allow accredited investors to co-invest in selected companies alongside Tribe. [S40] In March 2021, Tribe and Arrow Capital co-sponsored a SPAC raising $240 million, led by Sethi as CEO. [S41] Tribe filed plans for a second SPAC IPO later that month, with Odell Beckham Jr. [S42] serving as strategic advisor. [S43] In July 2022, Tribe announced that it launched an incubator program Tribe Crypto Labs, which had raised $25M from outside investors. [S44] In December 2023, he transitioned from CEO of Tribe Capital to chairman and chief investment officer (CIO). [S45] That month, he also joined cofounders Rene Saul, Fernando Sandoval and Eder Echeverria on the board of fintech firm Kapital, which was named to the 2024 CNBC Disruptor 50 list list five months later. [S46] In October 2024, he was appointed co-CEO of Kraken, serving alongside David Ripley. [S47] ## Nibiru\n\nIn September 2022, Sethi co-founded a crypto derivatives trading protocol named Nibiru.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Arjun Sethi's roles at Lolapps and MessageMe, including their acquisitions and challenges, influenced his transition to venture capital and his later leadership at Tribe Capital and Kraken.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections about Sethi's career. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with Lolapps: He was CEO there, and the company merged with 6waves. Then there was a layoff, and he left to join Social Capital. The acquisition by Stillfront in 2022 is mentioned. His time at Lolapps involved managing a large user base and dealing with mergers, which might have given him experience in scaling companies and handling acquisitions. The challenges like layoffs and rebranding could have taught him about company restructuring.\n\nThen MessageMe: He co-founded and led it, achieved rapid growth, but faced issues with Facebook revoking access. Yahoo acquired it, but the subsequent app (Yahoo! Livetext) failed. This shows challenges in maintaining product traction post-acquisition. His experience here might have influenced his understanding of the challenges in the tech industry, especially with big companies acquiring startups.\n\nTransitioning to Social Capital: After leaving Yahoo, he joined Social Capital as an investing partner. His angel investments and experience at Lolapps and MessageMe likely contributed to his venture capital role. The passage mentions he was an entrepreneur in residence there, which might be a stepping stone to his later roles.\n\nAt Tribe Capital: He co-founded it, and the passage talks about his investments and leadership. The fact that he moved from running startups to venture capital suggests that his previous experiences gave him the insight to identify and support early-stage startups. The mention of quantitative data in Tribe's investments might relate to his background in managing data-driven companies like Lolapps.\n\nLeadership at Kraken: He became co-CEO there. His experience with acquisitions and managing challenges at previous companies might have prepared him for leading a fintech company, especially in the crypto space. The passage also mentions his role in Nibiru, a crypto protocol, indicating his continued involvement in blockchain.\n\nNow, I need to connect these points. The acquisitions (Lolapps merged with 6waves, MessageMe acquired by Yahoo) and the challenges (layoffs, product shutdowns) likely provided Sethi with insights into the startup ecosystem, the importance of strategic acquisitions, and the risks involved. These experiences might have influenced his decision to move into venture capital, where he could support other startups. His roles at Tribe Capital and Kraken would then be a natural progression, applying his experiences to lead and invest in new ventures.\n\nI need to check the citations. For example, the merger of Lolapps with 6waves is [S10] and [S11]. The acquisition of MessageMe by Yahoo is [S24]. His transition to Social Capital is [S29]. The founding of Tribe Capital is [S32]. His role at Kraken is [S47].\n\nI should structure the answer by first discussing Lolapps and MessageMe's roles and challenges, then how these led to his venture capital transition, and finally his leadership at Tribe and Kraken. Each statement should have the relevant citations."

    "[S1] Arjun Sethi (entrepreneur)\n\n\n# Arjun Sethi (entrepreneur)\n\n\n\n**Arjun Sethi** (born January 15, 1983) is an American internet entrepreneur, investor and executive. [S2] He is co-founder and partner at venture capital firm Tribe Capital. [S3] Previously, he was a partner at Social Capital and an executive at Yahoo!, where he launched Yahoo! [S4] Livetext. [S5] Prior, he was co-founder and CEO of MessageMe (acquired by Yahoo!) and was the CEO of Lolapps, the developer behind Ravenwood Fair. [S6] In December 2023, he became Tribe Capital's chairman and CIO. [S7] ## Career\n\n\n### Lolapps\n\nIn 2008, Sethi took the role as CEO of Lolapps, which developed social games on the Facebook platform. [S8] Lolapps developed Ravenwood Fair which had 10 million monthly active users. [S9] At its peak, Lolapps had 150 million monthly active users across its portfolio of games. [S10] Lolapps merged with game publisher 6waves in 2011 which made the merged entity 6waves Lolapps the second largest game publisher on Facebook measured by monthly active users after Zynga. [S11] Sethi became Chief Product Officer in 6waves Lolapps, which went on to raise $35 million in funding from Korean gaming company Nexon. [S12] In 2012, 6waves Lolapps laid off most of its development team and Sethi left to join venture capital firm Social Capital as an entrepreneur in residence. [S13] 6waves Lolapps subsequently rebranded itself as 6waves, dropping Lolapps from its name. [S14] In January 2022, Stillfront Group acquired 6waves for $201M.

[S19] MessageMe reached five million users within 75 days of launch. [S20] The company raised close to $12 million across two rounds of funding led by Greylock Partners. [S21] MessageMe's rapid growth led to Facebook revoking its access to the Facebook Platform\u2019s \u201cFind Friends\u201d functionality for competitive reasons. [S22] Leaked internal Facebook emails expressed concern about resulting negative publicity for Facebook, particularly given Sethi\u2019s relationship with Social Capital and previous position at Lolapps. [S23] Yahoo acquired MessageMe in 2014 for a price between $30 million and $40 million,\nshut down the app MessageMe, and put Sethi and the ex-MessageMe team to work on a Yahoo messaging app meant to compete with Snapchat and WhatsApp. [S24] Yahoo's acquisition of MessageMe was part of CEO Marissa Mayer's larger strategy to bring in new talent via small startup acquisitions. [S25] In 2015, Sethi and the former MessageMe team launched Yahoo! [S26] Livetext, an audio-free video messaging app. [S27] It never gained significant traction and Yahoo shut down the product in 2016. [S28] ### Social Capital\n\nIn early 2016, Sethi left Yahoo to join Social Capital as an investing partner focused on consumer startups. [S29] At Social Capital, Sethi backed the firm's investments in and served on the board of directors of Carta, Relativity Space, Cover, and CryptoMove. [S30] On February 8, 2024, he released Termina, an AI software platform for investors to perform quantitative due diligence on potential investments. [S31] The program is used by \"sovereign governments, sovereign wealth and pension funds, family offices and private fund managers.\"\n\n\n## Tribe Capital\n\nIn 2018, three former Social Capital investing partners, Sethi, Ted Maidenberg and Jonathan Hsu, left to form Tribe Capital with $200 million targeted for its first fund. [S32] Tribe invests in early-stage startups and uses quantitative data to inform investment decisions. [S33] Tribe raised $335 million for its second fund and $394 million for its third fund. [S34] As of December 2023, Tribe has approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, about 20% of which is invested in India.",

[S37] Other Tribe investments include FTX, Kraken, Applied Intuition, EquipmentShare, Pipe Technologies, Docker, Republic, Instabase, and Momentus. [S38] Sethi serves on the board of directors of Kraken and Docker.
