      "answer": "<statement>N26 transitioned from using Wirecard's infrastructure to its own banking system in 2016, requiring customers to migrate to new accounts with updated IBANs and terminating previous Wirecard-held accounts.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] N26\n\n\n# N26\n\n\n\n**N26 Bank AG**, doing business as **N26**, and formerly named **Papayer GmbH**, and **Number26 GmbH***,* is a multinational German fintech and neobank company based in Berlin that offers a variety of financial services to individuals and businesses. [S2] N26 was founded in 2013 by Rocket Internet, an incubator, and operates in various European Union member states that are members of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). [S3] Their services include transaction accounts and debit cards, as well as overdraft and investment products under a subscription business model. [S4] The name of the company is derived from the number of smaller cubes in a complete Rubik's Cube, since a 3x3x3 cube has 26 individual visible cubes (27 minus 1 hidden). [S5] ## History\n\nFounded in August 2013 by Valentin Stalf and Maximilian Tayenthal as a fintech startup under the name Papayer GmbH, N26 initially offered a prepaid Mastercard financial management solution aimed at teenagers, which was launched in February 2014. [S6] During an interview with Business Insider later that year, the founders said that their service represented a niche market after receiving many inquiries regarding the availability of a similar service for adults. [S7] Subsequently, after securing \u20ac2 million in seed funding during June 2014, they changed their name to Number26 and discontinued the teenage finance service to work on a broader transaction account service for general use. [S8] N26 launched their banking product on October 20, 2014 in a private beta. [S9] Shortly after launch, they received \u20ac10 million in a Series A round, at which point the service has been available in Germany and Austria. [S10] During their initial operations, N26 did not hold a banking license; instead, it provided an interface to a backend provided by Wirecard. [S11] In July 2016, it re-branded as N26 Bank, after receiving a banking license they applied for 9 months prior by the German regulator BaFin. [S12] The company stated that they will start operating on their own infrastructure in autumn that year. [S13] At this point, they had over 200,000 customers. [S14] In June 2016, N26 terminated a number of customer accounts. [S15] The company said that reasons for these closures included suspected money laundering and excessive ATM withdrawals, with some customers making 15 to 30 withdrawals per month. [S16] N26 explained that while it offered free withdrawals, it incurred a cost of up to \u20ac2 per withdrawal in Germany, and that the volume of withdrawals by some users created a financial burden that could not be sustained across its customer base. [S17] The same month, N26 raised $40 million in a Series B round. [S18] When N26 started asking customers to transfer their accounts to the banks own infrastructure in November 2016, customers had to get a new account IBAN. [S19] Accounts previously held by Wirecard would be terminated. [S20] However, many customers reported issues during account migration, with many issues to get in touch with their customer support. [S21] N26 apologized and was transparent about what happened, saying they were overwhelmed by a large amount of customer support queries, even after initial preparation. [S22] However, they did not comment on other reported issues such as funds going missing and other software bugs. [S23] N26 made transaction accounts available across 17 Eurozone countries in December 2016. [S24] Shortly after, N26 reached more than 300,000 users in March 2017, at which point they were processing over 10 million credit card transactions per year, with a transaction volume of over \u20ac3 billion.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S86] In October 2022, it was reported that over 100 customers had their N26 bank accounts closed unexpectedly and without prior notice. [S87] One of several included a Ukrainian refugee named Anya Shamaieva fleeing the Russian war in Ukraine who was reported to have lost access to \u20ac15,000 and that N26 demanded she prove her identity in order to recover the funds. [S88] While many more customers continued to discover that their accounts had been unexpectedly frozen, N26 stated on their corporate blog that account closures, which the company refers to as \"blocks\", are made in order to prevent crimes from customers who pose a high-risk to the company. [S89] ### Anti-Money laundering compliance issues\n\nFollowing an inquiry made by several German medias reporting that it was possible to quickly open an N26 account with fake identity documents, the bank has been in German financial regulatory authority BaFin's sights since 2018. [S90] In May 2021 BaFin demanded that N26 take actions to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. [S91] And in June 2021, the bank was fined 4.25 million euros by BaFin for weaknesses in its anti-money laundering system. [S92] At least 50 transactions were suspicious and occurred between 2019 and 2020. [S93] The bank was too slow to report them to BaFin which prevented an efficient inquiry. [S94] BaFin also installed a supervisor in the bank. [S95] In 2022 the Bank of Italy halted N26 from taking on new customers after finding money laundering security violations. [S96] In addition to the ban on new customers, N26 was also prohibited from offering new products and services to already existing clients in Italy. [S97] These include crypto assets. [S98] In addition to the sanctions imposed by BaFin, as well as falling short on obligations to investors, German financial group Allianz announced its intentions to sell its 5% stake in N26 in April 2023. [S99] That same year in July, BaFin announced it would be extending its probationary supervision over N26 to ensure full compliance with anti-money laundering prevention. [S100] ### Business strategy\n\nIn the span of four years, N26 has entered and abruptly exited from the United Kingdom and the United States: two of the west's largest financial markets. [S101] N26 has gathered much criticism for its global expansion and growth strategy. [S102] In 2018, the company launched in the United Kingdom. [S103] Less than 2 years after launch, N26 announced it would discontinue its services in the UK citing Brexit as a driving factor for inability to continue their business with a license from a European Union member (Germany). [S104] Even though the referendum for Brexit was decided in the 2016, and the British government formally confirmed the results in 2017, N26 still cited this as the main driving reason for their departure from the British banking market in 2020. [S105] In 2019, N26 also launched its application in the US with banking services provided by Axos Financial. [S106] In November 2021, N26 ceased operations in the US to focus on the European market with account closures being finalized in early 2022. [S107] Despite these claims, Forbes magazine criticized N26 for failing in the US because of its refusal to offer innovative product to the already competitive and fast-paced American financial market. [S108] Shortly after telling its US customers of shifted priorities for the European sector, N26 launched in Brazil in May 2023 after announcing the launch to Latin America in 2019, entering the country in 2020, and finally testing the product in 2022. [S109] In March 2023 the company was heavily criticized for dysfunctional corporate governance. [S110] In addition to executive flaws, failure in the UK and US markets in addition to regulators in Italy and Germany sanctioning the company's growth contributed to a delay for the company to file for an initial public offering as well a further investment from outsider sources.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about N26's transition from Wirecard's infrastructure to their own banking system in 2016 and its impact on customer experiences and broader implications for the company's operations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that in July 2016, N26 rebranded as N26 Bank after getting a banking license. They planned to operate on their own infrastructure in autumn 2016. Then, in November 2016, they asked customers to transfer accounts to their own infrastructure, which required new IBANs and ended Wirecard accounts. Customers faced issues during migration, like difficulty contacting support. N26 apologized, saying they were overwhelmed. However, they didn't address other issues like funds going missing or software bugs. \n\nSo, the impact on customers was negative during the transition. They had technical issues and problems with customer support. The broader implications might include operational challenges, like the difficulty in managing the transition, which could have affected their reputation. Also, the mention of account closures in June 2016 (maybe related to the transition?) and later issues with anti-money laundering could be part of the broader implications. But the question specifically focuses on the 2016 transition. \n\nI need to check the citations. The relevant sentences are S12 (rebranding and starting own infrastructure), S13 (operating on own infrastructure), S18 (Series B funding), S19 (customers needed new IBANs), S20 (Wirecard accounts terminated), S21 (migration issues and support problems), S22 (apology for being overwhelmed), S23 (no comment on other issues). Also, S14 mentions having 200k customers at the time. \n\nThe answer should state that the transition caused customer issues during migration, leading to support problems and some unresolved issues. The broader implications might include operational strains and potential reputational damage, but the context doesn't explicitly mention long-term operational impacts beyond the migration challenges. The later issues with account closures and compliance (in later passages) might be separate but could be linked to the transition's aftermath. However, the question is specifically about 2016, so focus on that period.\n\nSo, the statements would be:\n\n- Transition started in 2016, leading to customer migration issues (S19, S20, S21, S22, S23).\n- The company faced challenges in handling the transition, affecting customer experience.\n- Broader implications include operational challenges during the transition, but the context doesn't specify more beyond that.\n\nNeed to make sure citations are correctly placed. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S12 and S13 mention the transition, but the impact on customers is in S19-S23. The answer should tie these together."

[S22] However, they did not comment on other reported issues such as funds going missing and other software bugs. [S23] N26 made transaction accounts available across 17 Eurozone countries in December 2016. [S24] Shortly after, N26 reached more than 300,000 users in March 2017, at which point they were processing over 10 million credit card transactions per year, with a transaction volume of over \u20ac3 billion.",
        "[S86] In October 2022, it was reported that over 100 customers had their N26 bank accounts closed unexpectedly and without prior notice. [S87] One of several included a Ukrainian refugee named Anya Shamaieva fleeing the Russian war in Ukraine who was reported to have lost access to \u20ac15,000 and that N26 demanded she prove her identity in order to recover the funds. [S88] While many more customers continued to discover that their accounts had been unexpectedly frozen, N26 stated on their corporate blog that account closures, which the company refers to as \"blocks\", are made in order to prevent crimes from customers who pose a high-risk to the company. [S89] ### Anti-Money laundering compliance issues\n\nFollowing an inquiry made by several German medias reporting that it was possible to quickly open an N26 account with fake identity documents, the bank has been in German financial regulatory authority BaFin's sights since 2018. [S90] In May 2021 BaFin demanded that N26 take actions to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. [S91] And in June 2021, the bank was fined 4.25 million euros by BaFin for weaknesses in its anti-money laundering system. [S92] At least 50 transactions were suspicious and occurred between 2019 and 2020. [S93] The bank was too slow to report them to BaFin which prevented an efficient inquiry. [S94] BaFin also installed a supervisor in the bank. [S95] In 2022 the Bank of Italy halted N26 from taking on new customers after finding money laundering security violations. [S96] In addition to the ban on new customers, N26 was also prohibited from offering new products and services to already existing clients in Italy. [S97] These include crypto assets. [S98] In addition to the sanctions imposed by BaFin, as well as falling short on obligations to investors, German financial group Allianz announced its intentions to sell its 5% stake in N26 in April 2023. [S99] That same year in July, BaFin announced it would be extending its probationary supervision over N26 to ensure full compliance with anti-money laundering prevention. [S100] ### Business strategy\n\nIn the span of four years, N26 has entered and abruptly exited from the United Kingdom and the United States: two of the west's largest financial markets. [S101] N26 has gathered much criticism for its global expansion and growth strategy. [S102] In 2018, the company launched in the United Kingdom. [S103] Less than 2 years after launch, N26 announced it would discontinue its services in the UK citing Brexit as a driving factor for inability to continue their business with a license from a European Union member (Germany). [S104] Even though the referendum for Brexit was decided in the 2016, and the British government formally confirmed the results in 2017, N26 still cited this as the main driving reason for their departure from the British banking market in 2020. [S105] In 2019, N26 also launched its application in the US with banking services provided by Axos Financial. [S106] In November 2021, N26 ceased operations in the US to focus on the European market with account closures being finalized in early 2022. [S107] Despite these claims, Forbes magazine criticized N26 for failing in the US because of its refusal to offer innovative product to the already competitive and fast-paced American financial market. [S108] Shortly after telling its US customers of shifted priorities for the European sector, N26 launched in Brazil in May 2023 after announcing the launch to Latin America in 2019, entering the country in 2020, and finally testing the product in 2022. [S109] In March 2023 the company was heavily criticized for dysfunctional corporate governance. [S110] In addition to executive flaws, failure in the UK and US markets in addition to regulators in Italy and Germany sanctioning the company's growth contributed to a delay for the company to file for an initial public offering as well a further investment from outsider sources.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how N26's regulatory and operational challenges influenced its financial strategies, including investor confidence and expansion plans. I need to look through the provided supporting context and find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passages for mentions of regulatory issues. In Passage 2, there's a lot about BaFin and anti-money laundering problems. For example, S91 mentions BaFin demanding actions to prevent money laundering, and S92 says they were fined 4.25 million euros. Then there's S96 where the Bank of Italy halted new customers due to violations. These regulatory issues probably affected their operations and financial strategies.\n\nAlso, in S101, N26 exited the UK and US markets. The reasons given were Brexit and failure to innovate in the US. But the user is asking about regulatory and operational challenges. The UK exit might be due to regulatory hurdles post-Brexit, and the US exit could be both regulatory and operational, like not offering innovative products. \n\nLooking at investor confidence, S99 mentions Allianz selling its stake in 2023, which likely reflects decreased confidence. Also, S111 talks about delays in IPO and investment due to regulatory issues and poor governance.\n\nExpansion plans: The company exited UK and US, which are big markets, and then went to Brazil. The regulatory issues in Italy and Germany might have forced them to focus on Europe again. Also, the security incidents in S86-89 about account closures could impact their reputation and thus expansion strategies.\n\nI need to connect these points. Regulatory challenges led to fines, supervision, and restrictions in certain markets, which probably made them more cautious. Operational issues like account closures and migration problems affected customer trust. This likely made them adjust their expansion plans, maybe focusing on regions with less regulatory friction. Investor confidence dropped, leading to selling stakes and delayed IPOs.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into statements with citations. Each sentence should have the relevant citations. For example, the regulatory issues leading to fines and supervision would cite S91, S92, S96, S99, S100. The exit from UK and US would cite S101-S107. Investor confidence issues would cite S99, S111. Expansion plans changes would cite S101, S107, S109.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. Also, check that all citations are correctly numbered as per the passage."

[S113] Haupert had already notified N26 of the vulnerabilities back in September 2016. [S114] N26 acknowledged the issues and claimed that they had been fixed before they became public, adding that no user account had actually been compromised. [S115] In March 2019 German media reported that customers who had their account credentials stolen found it difficult to contact the bank and resolve the situation. [S116] Customer advocates reported that there was a growing number of complaints from phishing victims who were unable to access their accounts and found it difficult to contact the bank. [S117] In a widely reported case N26 took more than two weeks to restore access for a customer who had \u20ac80,000 stolen from his account.

[S120] According to the employees, trust in management was on a historical low. [S121] Following employee announcements of a company-wide election to form an election committee (\"Wahlvorstand\"), N26 obtained a temporary injuction seeking to postpone the meeting, arguing that the COVID-19 hygiene concept did not meet the legal requirements. [S122] Trade unionists stated that infection protection regulations should not be used to obstruct unwanted employee representation. [S123] Johanna Wenckebach, Head of the labor law department at the Hugo Sinzheimer Institute, stated in an interview that hygiene regulations served as a pretext for preventing an event. [S124] She said that the company's subsequent organization of an alternative event demonstrated this. [S125] Wenckebach also stated that N26 management, in a widely circulated email, explicitly stated their opposition to a works council due to concerns about confrontations and process delays, saying \"it is against the values of N26\". [S126] To protect the named employees from further legal action, the trade union Ver.di stepped in to host the meeting at an outside venue. [S127] After N26 filed another injunction targeting Ver.di, IG Metall, another trade union organizing workers in the tech sector, called for the meeting instead. [S128] The election committee was established in a meeting that took place at the Hofbr\u00e4u Berlin. [S129] The company attempted to stop the meeting through legal means through a second injunction, claiming the venue lacked an adequate hygiene concept, but failed. [S130] During the meeting, the police were called over hygiene concerns, but found no violations of current COVID-19 safety measures after the venue operator, Bj\u00f6rn Schwarz, confirmed having an approved safety and hygiene plan. [S131] The founders of N26 criticized the takeover of the event by IG Metall, stating that any quickly organized election driven by external parties \"would not be inclusive, safe, or representative\". [S132] They stated their support for a works council but only under adherence to existing laws. [S133] They also announced that no further legal steps would be taken against the election process to de-escalate the situation. [S134] The works councils were established in November and December 2020, with a total voter turnout of around 30%. [S135] In response, CEO Valentin Stalf apologized in a blog post, stating that N26 supports the right of employees to formal representation.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that led N26 to withdraw from the US and UK, and how these decisions aligned with their focus on Europe.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the sentences. \n\nStarting with the UK withdrawal: Sentence S35 mentions that N26 stopped doing business in the UK due to Brexit, specifically the UK leaving the EU. The reasons given are that European banks need a UK banking license now, and the EU Withdrawal Agreement's timing. So that's a key factor for the UK exit. \n\nFor the US withdrawal, sentence S44 states that N26 pulled out of the US in 2022 to focus on their core European business. The context also mentions that they closed 500,000 accounts. But what about other factors? The passage mentions that in the US, they partnered with Axos Financial and used Visa cards (S30, S31), but maybe the regulatory differences or operational challenges? However, the direct reason given in the context is the strategic focus on Europe. \n\nLooking for other sentences that might mention reasons. There's S36 which talks about the UK withdrawal factors. For the US, S44 and S46 mention the withdrawal to focus on Europe. Are there any other sentences? Maybe S47 says the withdrawal was to focus on core European business. \n\nSo the main factors are Brexit-related regulations for the UK and strategic realignment towards Europe for the US. The context doesn't mention other factors like financial issues or customer complaints for the US exit, just the strategic focus. \n\nNow, checking if there are any other citations. For the UK, S35, S36, S37. For the US, S44, S45, S46, S47. Also, maybe S30 and S31 about the US operations, but those are more about how they operated there, not the reasons for leaving. \n\nSo the answer should cite S35, S36, S37 for the UK reasons, and S44, S45, S46, S47 for the US reasons. Also, the alignment with European focus is mentioned in S47. \n\nWait, the question also asks how these decisions aligned with their strategic focus. The context says \"to focus on N26's core European business\" in S46 and S47. So that's the alignment. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each factor and the corresponding citations. Make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S25-S29 talk about funding, but not directly related to the withdrawal. \n\nSo the final answer should have statements explaining the factors for UK (Brexit regulations) and US (strategic focus), each with their citations."

[S37] Following internal conflicts between employees and the N26 management, the workers of N26's Berlin subsidiaries, N26 GmbH and N26 Operations GmbH, elected works councils to represent the employees of the Berlin offices in November and December 2020. [S38] The elections saw approximately 30% voter turnout, resulting in eleven elected works council members. [S39] These elections followed attempts to establish a works council in summer 2020, which were reportedly met with resistance from N26 management, including legal actions such as interim injunctions attempting to prevent employee meetings and the establishment of the electoral committee (\"Wahlvorstand\"). [S40] In January 2021 N26 announced the upcoming appointment of former ProSiebenSat.1 Media and Zalando executive Jan Kemper as the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. [S41] In January 2022, the bank announced that Kemper will also be taking over the role of Chief Operating Officer in addition to his role as CFO. [S42] In October 2021 N26 raised $900 million in a Series E round led by Third Point Ventures and Coatue Management, and joined by Dragoneer Investment Group as well as existing N26 investors. [S43] The funding round valued the digital bank at $9 billion. [S44] In November 2021 N26 announced that it would be pulling out of the United States in January 2022, leading to the closure of approximately 500,000 accounts. [S45] American customers were no longer be able to use its app after January 11, 2022. [S46] The withdrawal was to focus on N26's core European business. [S47] The company confirmed this in an official press release and N26's official corporate blog. [S48] In November 2022 N26 changed its legal form from a German Limited Liability Company (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung \u2013 GmbH) to a German Stock Corporation (Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 AG). [S49] At the same time, a five-member board of directors was appointed, chaired by Marcus W. [S50] Mosen. [S51] Other members are J\u00f6rg Gerbig, Dr. [S52] Barbara Roth, Dr. [S53] Julian Deutz and Dr. [S54] Robert Killian.

[S114] N26 acknowledged the issues and claimed that they had been fixed before they became public, adding that no user account had actually been compromised. [S115] In March 2019 German media reported that customers who had their account credentials stolen found it difficult to contact the bank and resolve the situation. [S116] Customer advocates reported that there was a growing number of complaints from phishing victims who were unable to access their accounts and found it difficult to contact the bank. [S117] In a widely reported case N26 took more than two weeks to restore access for a customer who had \u20ac80,000 stolen from his account. [S118] The reports raised the question if the rapid growth of the bank had left it ill-equipped to deal with the increasing number of support cases.

[S120] According to the employees, trust in management was on a historical low. [S121] Following employee announcements of a company-wide election to form an election committee (\"Wahlvorstand\"), N26 obtained a temporary injuction seeking to postpone the meeting, arguing that the COVID-19 hygiene concept did not meet the legal requirements. [S122] Trade unionists stated that infection protection regulations should not be used to obstruct unwanted employee representation. [S123] Johanna Wenckebach, Head of the labor law department at the Hugo Sinzheimer Institute, stated in an interview that hygiene regulations served as a pretext for preventing an event. [S124] She said that the company's subsequent organization of an alternative event demonstrated this. [S125] Wenckebach also stated that N26 management, in a widely circulated email, explicitly stated their opposition to a works council due to concerns about confrontations and process delays, saying \"it is against the values of N26\". [S126] To protect the named employees from further legal action, the trade union Ver.di stepped in to host the meeting at an outside venue. [S127] After N26 filed another injunction targeting Ver.di, IG Metall, another trade union organizing workers in the tech sector, called for the meeting instead. [S128] The election committee was established in a meeting that took place at the Hofbr\u00e4u Berlin. [S129] The company attempted to stop the meeting through legal means through a second injunction, claiming the venue lacked an adequate hygiene concept, but failed. [S130] During the meeting, the police were called over hygiene concerns, but found no violations of current COVID-19 safety measures after the venue operator, Bj\u00f6rn Schwarz, confirmed having an approved safety and hygiene plan. [S131] The founders of N26 criticized the takeover of the event by IG Metall, stating that any quickly organized election driven by external parties \"would not be inclusive, safe, or representative\". [S132] They stated their support for a works council but only under adherence to existing laws. [S133] They also announced that no further legal steps would be taken against the election process to de-escalate the situation. [S134] The works councils were established in November and December 2020, with a total voter turnout of around 30%. [S135] In response, CEO Valentin Stalf apologized in a blog post, stating that N26 supports the right of employees to formal representation.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how N26's funding rounds and valuation changes reflect its growth trajectory and the significance of its $9 billion valuation in 2021.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me scan through them to find relevant information about funding rounds and valuations.\n\nStarting with the early funding: [S25] mentions a $160 million Series C round in 2018. Then [S27] talks about a $300 million Series D in 2019, valuing them at $2.7B. [S33] says they added $170M, taking valuation to $3.5B. [S34] mentions another $100M in May 2020 at the same valuation. Then in October 2021, [S42] states a $900M Series E round valuing them at $9B. \n\nSo the funding rounds show increasing amounts and valuations over time, which indicates growth. The $9B valuation in 2021 is a significant jump from previous rounds. The significance might be that it's a milestone, showing investor confidence, possibly positioning N26 as a major player in the digital banking sector. Also, the context mentions that after the $9B round, they pulled out of the US to focus on Europe, which could be part of their strategy post-valuation.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The growth trajectory is shown through the Series C, D, and E rounds with increasing valuations. The $9B valuation is specifically in [S43]. Also, the context mentions that the $9B round was led by major investors like Third Point Ventures and Coatue Management, which adds to its significance.\n\nI should structure the answer by first explaining the funding rounds and valuations as indicators of growth, then the significance of the $9B valuation. Each statement needs to have the appropriate citations. Let me check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. For example, [S28] mentions overtaking Revolut as the most valuable mobile bank in Europe after the Series D, which shows competitive positioning. But the main points are the funding rounds and the $9B valuation.\n\nSo the answer would have statements about each funding round and their valuations, then the significance of the $9B. Make sure each citation is correctly numbered."

        "[S112] In December 2016 the research fellow in computer science from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg Vincent Haupert demonstrated how he could take advantage of security vulnerabilities in order to get access to N26 users' accounts. [S113] Haupert had already notified N26 of the vulnerabilities back in September 2016. [S114] N26 acknowledged the issues and claimed that they had been fixed before they became public, adding that no user account had actually been compromised. [S115] In March 2019 German media reported that customers who had their account credentials stolen found it difficult to contact the bank and resolve the situation. [S116] Customer advocates reported that there was a growing number of complaints from phishing victims who were unable to access their accounts and found it difficult to contact the bank. [S117] In a widely reported case N26 took more than two weeks to restore access for a customer who had \u20ac80,000 stolen from his account. [S118] The reports raised the question if the rapid growth of the bank had left it ill-equipped to deal with the increasing number of support cases. [S119] ### Works council\n\nN26 management drew public criticism for its opposition to the election of works councils at its Berlin-based subsidiaries, N26 GmbH and N26 Operations GmbH in August 2020. [S120] According to the employees, trust in management was on a historical low. [S121] Following employee announcements of a company-wide election to form an election committee (\"Wahlvorstand\"), N26 obtained a temporary injuction seeking to postpone the meeting, arguing that the COVID-19 hygiene concept did not meet the legal requirements. [S122] Trade unionists stated that infection protection regulations should not be used to obstruct unwanted employee representation. [S123] Johanna Wenckebach, Head of the labor law department at the Hugo Sinzheimer Institute, stated in an interview that hygiene regulations served as a pretext for preventing an event. [S124] She said that the company's subsequent organization of an alternative event demonstrated this. [S125] Wenckebach also stated that N26 management, in a widely circulated email, explicitly stated their opposition to a works council due to concerns about confrontations and process delays, saying \"it is against the values of N26\". [S126] To protect the named employees from further legal action, the trade union Ver.di stepped in to host the meeting at an outside venue. [S127] After N26 filed another injunction targeting Ver.di, IG Metall, another trade union organizing workers in the tech sector, called for the meeting instead. [S128] The election committee was established in a meeting that took place at the Hofbr\u00e4u Berlin. [S129] The company attempted to stop the meeting through legal means through a second injunction, claiming the venue lacked an adequate hygiene concept, but failed. [S130] During the meeting, the police were called over hygiene concerns, but found no violations of current COVID-19 safety measures after the venue operator, Bj\u00f6rn Schwarz, confirmed having an approved safety and hygiene plan. [S131] The founders of N26 criticized the takeover of the event by IG Metall, stating that any quickly organized election driven by external parties \"would not be inclusive, safe, or representative\". [S132] They stated their support for a works council but only under adherence to existing laws. [S133] They also announced that no further legal steps would be taken against the election process to de-escalate the situation. [S134] The works councils were established in November and December 2020, with a total voter turnout of around 30%. [S135] In response, CEO Valentin Stalf apologized in a blog post, stating that N26 supports the right of employees to formal representation. [S136] In May 2022 the employees elected a works council for the second time. [S137] According to a media report, members of the works council subsequently reported positive results."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how N26's legal structure changes in 2022 and its partnership with Upvest in 2024 reflect its evolving business strategy. I need to look at the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, the legal structure change in 2022. Scanning through the passage, I see sentence S48: \"In November 2022 N26 changed its legal form from a German Limited Liability Company (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung \u2013 GmbH) to a German Stock Corporation (Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 AG).\" Then S49 mentions appointing a five-member board of directors. Changing from a GmbH to an AG is a significant step, usually indicating growth and preparation for larger operations, maybe even an IPO. This suggests the company is scaling up and seeking more formal governance.\n\nNext, the partnership with Upvest in 2024. Sentence S55 states: \"In the first half of 2024, N26 partners with Upvest, an investment API provider, to launch a stock and ETF trading product.\" This expansion into stock and ETF trading shows diversification of services, moving beyond traditional banking to include investment products. The mention of launching in Austria and then Germany indicates a strategic market expansion.\n\nNow, how do these reflect the business strategy? The legal change in 2022 (S48, S49) likely supports scaling operations and possibly preparing for future growth, like an IPO. The partnership in 2024 (S55) shows diversification into investment services, which could be part of expanding their product offerings to increase revenue streams and compete in a broader financial services market.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other relevant sentences. The rest of the context talks about funding rounds, withdrawals from markets, and other events, but the key points are S48, S49, and S55. The user might also be interested in the context of previous moves, like exiting the US in 2022 (S44-S47), but the question specifically focuses on the 2022 legal change and 2024 partnership. So the answer should connect the legal structure change to scaling and formal governance, and the partnership to product diversification and market expansion."

Then S63 says the video identification is done by IDnow. So IDnow is involved in the verification process. \n\nNext, S64 states that the available verification method depends on the nationality, country of residence, and type of ID. That directly answers the first part about differences based on nationality and residence. \n\nSo the answer should connect the verification methods varying with nationality and residence, and IDnow's role in the video identification. The citations would be S64 for the variation and S63 for IDnow's role. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that add more info. S65 might be part of the same point, but looking at the text, S64 is the key sentence. Let me check again. The passage says \"The available verification method depends on the nationality, the country of residence, and the type of ID of the customer.\" So that's S64. \n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the account opening process varies based on nationality and residence, with different verification methods, and IDnow handles the video identification.

Also, note that the Eurozone exceptions are Austria and Italy, but the question is about the Eurozone in general. \n\nSo the answer should state that in the Eurozone (excluding Austria and Italy), basic account holders have 5 ATM withdrawals per month, others (maybe premium holders?) have 3. For foreign currency, basic accounts have a 1.70% fee, while premium accounts don't. \n\nCitations would be [S75] for the withdrawal limits and [S77] for the foreign currency fees. Also, [S74] mentions no fees for basic transactions, but the specific withdrawal limits are in [S75]. \n\nWait, the user is asking about \"others\" \u2013 does \"others\" refer to premium account holders? The passage says \"primary account holders\" and \"others\". The term \"others\" might need clarification, but based on the context, since the basic account is the primary one, \"others\" could be those with premium accounts. But the passage doesn't explicitly say that. However, the fees for foreign currency are mentioned for basic accounts versus free for You and Metal. So maybe \"others\" here refers to non-basic account holders. \n\nSo the answer would be structured as two parts: withdrawal limits and foreign currency fees. Each part needs citations. The statement about limits would cite [S75], and the foreign currency part [S77]. Also, [S74] might be relevant for the no fees on basic transactions, but the question is about ATM withdrawals specifically. \n\nI think that's all.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the security measures N26 provides for card usage and how that relates to the deposit protection scheme. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage has several sections, so I'll scan each part. \n\nUnder the \"Security\" section, there's a mention that customers can lock/unlock their MasterCard via the app, enable/disable usage abroad or online, and adjust daily limits. That's definitely security measures. The sentence numbers here are S80 and S81. \n\nThen, there's a sentence about funds being covered by statutory requirements and protected up to 100,000\u20ac under the German Deposit Protection scheme. That's S82. \n\nSo the answer should mention the app-based controls (locking, limits, usage settings) and the deposit protection. The deposit protection is part of the statutory requirements, so it's related to the security measures in that they both contribute to protecting the user's funds. \n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer has the correct citations. The security measures are covered in S80 and S81, and the deposit protection is S82. \n\nWait, the question asks how the security measures relate to the deposit protection. The passage doesn't explicitly state a direct relationship, but both are part of N26's security and regulatory compliance. So the answer should note that the security measures are part of their overall security, while the deposit protection is a separate statutory requirement. \n\nI should structure the answer with two statements: one about the security measures with citations S80 and S81, and another about the deposit protection with S82. The relation is that both contribute to security, but the deposit protection is under the German scheme. \n\nCheck if there are other mentions. The rest of the passage talks about fees, availability, etc., which aren't relevant here. \n\nSo the final answer should have two sentences, each with their citations. Make sure the citations are correctly formatted in the <cite> tags."

[S2] N26 was founded in 2013 by Rocket Internet, an incubator, and operates in various European Union member states that are members of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). [S3] Their services include transaction accounts and debit cards, as well as overdraft and investment products under a subscription business model. [S4] The name of the company is derived from the number of smaller cubes in a complete Rubik's Cube, since a 3x3x3 cube has 26 individual visible cubes (27 minus 1 hidden). [S5] ## History\n\nFounded in August 2013 by Valentin Stalf and Maximilian Tayenthal as a fintech startup under the name Papayer GmbH, N26 initially offered a prepaid Mastercard financial management solution aimed at teenagers, which was launched in February 2014. [S6] During an interview with Business Insider later that year, the founders said that their service represented a niche market after receiving many inquiries regarding the availability of a similar service for adults. [S7] Subsequently, after securing \u20ac2 million in seed funding during June 2014, they changed their name to Number26 and discontinued the teenage finance service to work on a broader transaction account service for general use. [S8] N26 launched their banking product on October 20, 2014 in a private beta. [S9] Shortly after launch, they received \u20ac10 million in a Series A round, at which point the service has been available in Germany and Austria. [S10] During their initial operations, N26 did not hold a banking license; instead, it provided an interface to a backend provided by Wirecard. [S11] In July 2016, it re-branded as N26 Bank, after receiving a banking license they applied for 9 months prior by the German regulator BaFin. [S12] The company stated that they will start operating on their own infrastructure in autumn that year. [S13] At this point, they had over 200,000 customers. [S14] In June 2016, N26 terminated a number of customer accounts. [S15] The company said that reasons for these closures included suspected money laundering and excessive ATM withdrawals, with some customers making 15 to 30 withdrawals per month. [S16] N26 explained that while it offered free withdrawals, it incurred a cost of up to \u20ac2 per withdrawal in Germany, and that the volume of withdrawals by some users created a financial burden that could not be sustained across its customer base. [S17] The same month, N26 raised $40 million in a Series B round. [S18] When N26 started asking customers to transfer their accounts to the banks own infrastructure in November 2016, customers had to get a new account IBAN. [S19] Accounts previously held by Wirecard would be terminated. [S20] However, many customers reported issues during account migration, with many issues to get in touch with their customer support. [S21] N26 apologized and was transparent about what happened, saying they were overwhelmed by a large amount of customer support queries, even after initial preparation. [S22] However, they did not comment on other reported issues such as funds going missing and other software bugs. [S23] N26 made transaction accounts available across 17 Eurozone countries in December 2016. [S24] Shortly after, N26 reached more than 300,000 users in March 2017, at which point they were processing over 10 million credit card transactions per year, with a transaction volume of over \u20ac3 billion.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S86] In October 2022, it was reported that over 100 customers had their N26 bank accounts closed unexpectedly and without prior notice. [S87] One of several included a Ukrainian refugee named Anya Shamaieva fleeing the Russian war in Ukraine who was reported to have lost access to \u20ac15,000 and that N26 demanded she prove her identity in order to recover the funds. [S88] While many more customers continued to discover that their accounts had been unexpectedly frozen, N26 stated on their corporate blog that account closures, which the company refers to as \"blocks\", are made in order to prevent crimes from customers who pose a high-risk to the company. [S89] ### Anti-Money laundering compliance issues\n\nFollowing an inquiry made by several German medias reporting that it was possible to quickly open an N26 account with fake identity documents, the bank has been in German financial regulatory authority BaFin's sights since 2018. [S90] In May 2021 BaFin demanded that N26 take actions to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. [S91] And in June 2021, the bank was fined 4.25 million euros by BaFin for weaknesses in its anti-money laundering system. [S92] At least 50 transactions were suspicious and occurred between 2019 and 2020. [S93] The bank was too slow to report them to BaFin which prevented an efficient inquiry. [S94] BaFin also installed a supervisor in the bank. [S95] In 2022 the Bank of Italy halted N26 from taking on new customers after finding money laundering security violations. [S96] In addition to the ban on new customers, N26 was also prohibited from offering new products and services to already existing clients in Italy. [S97] These include crypto assets. [S98] In addition to the sanctions imposed by BaFin, as well as falling short on obligations to investors, German financial group Allianz announced its intentions to sell its 5% stake in N26 in April 2023. [S99] That same year in July, BaFin announced it would be extending its probationary supervision over N26 to ensure full compliance with anti-money laundering prevention. [S100] ### Business strategy\n\nIn the span of four years, N26 has entered and abruptly exited from the United Kingdom and the United States: two of the west's largest financial markets. [S101] N26 has gathered much criticism for its global expansion and growth strategy. [S102] In 2018, the company launched in the United Kingdom. [S103] Less than 2 years after launch, N26 announced it would discontinue its services in the UK citing Brexit as a driving factor for inability to continue their business with a license from a European Union member (Germany). [S104] Even though the referendum for Brexit was decided in the 2016, and the British government formally confirmed the results in 2017, N26 still cited this as the main driving reason for their departure from the British banking market in 2020. [S105] In 2019, N26 also launched its application in the US with banking services provided by Axos Financial. [S106] In November 2021, N26 ceased operations in the US to focus on the European market with account closures being finalized in early 2022. [S107] Despite these claims, Forbes magazine criticized N26 for failing in the US because of its refusal to offer innovative product to the already competitive and fast-paced American financial market. [S108] Shortly after telling its US customers of shifted priorities for the European sector, N26 launched in Brazil in May 2023 after announcing the launch to Latin America in 2019, entering the country in 2020, and finally testing the product in 2022. [S109] In March 2023 the company was heavily criticized for dysfunctional corporate governance. [S110] In addition to executive flaws, failure in the UK and US markets in addition to regulators in Italy and Germany sanctioning the company's growth contributed to a delay for the company to file for an initial public offering as well a further investment from outsider sources.

[S92] At least 50 transactions were suspicious and occurred between 2019 and 2020. [S93] The bank was too slow to report them to BaFin which prevented an efficient inquiry. [S94] BaFin also installed a supervisor in the bank. [S95] In 2022 the Bank of Italy halted N26 from taking on new customers after finding money laundering security violations. [S96] In addition to the ban on new customers, N26 was also prohibited from offering new products and services to already existing clients in Italy. [S97] These include crypto assets. [S98] In addition to the sanctions imposed by BaFin, as well as falling short on obligations to investors, German financial group Allianz announced its intentions to sell its 5% stake in N26 in April 2023. [S99] That same year in July, BaFin announced it would be extending its probationary supervision over N26 to ensure full compliance with anti-money laundering prevention. [S100] ### Business strategy\n\nIn the span of four years, N26 has entered and abruptly exited from the United Kingdom and the United States: two of the west's largest financial markets. [S101] N26 has gathered much criticism for its global expansion and growth strategy. [S102] In 2018, the company launched in the United Kingdom. [S103] Less than 2 years after launch, N26 announced it would discontinue its services in the UK citing Brexit as a driving factor for inability to continue their business with a license from a European Union member (Germany). [S104] Even though the referendum for Brexit was decided in the 2016, and the British government formally confirmed the results in 2017, N26 still cited this as the main driving reason for their departure from the British banking market in 2020. [S105] In 2019, N26 also launched its application in the US with banking services provided by Axos Financial. [S106] In November 2021, N26 ceased operations in the US to focus on the European market with account closures being finalized in early 2022. [S107] Despite these claims, Forbes magazine criticized N26 for failing in the US because of its refusal to offer innovative product to the already competitive and fast-paced American financial market. [S108] Shortly after telling its US customers of shifted priorities for the European sector, N26 launched in Brazil in May 2023 after announcing the launch to Latin America in 2019, entering the country in 2020, and finally testing the product in 2022. [S109] In March 2023 the company was heavily criticized for dysfunctional corporate governance. [S110] In addition to executive flaws, failure in the UK and US markets in addition to regulators in Italy and Germany sanctioning the company's growth contributed to a delay for the company to file for an initial public offering as well a further investment from outsider sources. [S111] ### Security incidents"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key factors that led N26 to exit the UK and US markets and how these decisions relate to broader regulatory and strategic challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that N26 exited the UK and US, and there are specific sentences about that. Let me scan through the text.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Business strategy\" with sentences S101 to S111. Specifically, S101 states that N26 entered and exited the UK and US, citing Brexit as a reason for the UK exit. S104 mentions that they cited Brexit as the main reason for leaving the UK in 2020. However, the user might want to know if there are other factors beyond Brexit. The passage also mentions that in the US, they exited in 2021, but the reason given is to focus on Europe. However, Forbes criticized them for not offering innovative products in the US. \n\nAdditionally, there are regulatory issues mentioned in other parts. For example, S86-S100 talk about account closures, anti-money laundering issues, fines from BaFin, and the Bank of Italy's actions. These regulatory challenges might have contributed to their strategic decisions. Also, the company faced criticism for corporate governance (S110) and delays in IPO and investments (S111). \n\nSo, the key factors would include Brexit-related challenges in the UK, regulatory issues like AML compliance problems, fines, and the need to focus on the European market. The US exit might be due to both strategic focus and failure to innovate in a competitive market. The broader challenges include regulatory scrutiny, compliance issues, and corporate governance problems.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the UK exit is cited from S104, US exit from S107, regulatory issues from S91, S92, S96, S97, etc. Also, the strategic focus on Europe is mentioned in S107. The Forbes criticism is in S108. The corporate governance issues are in S110 and S111.\n\nI should structure the answer with each key factor as a separate statement, citing the relevant sentences. Need to check if all citations are correctly linked and that each sentence is properly enclosed in <statement> tags with <cite> as needed."

    "[S1] N26\n\n\n# N26\n\n\n\n**N26 Bank AG**, doing business as **N26**, and formerly named **Papayer GmbH**, and **Number26 GmbH***,* is a multinational German fintech and neobank company based in Berlin that offers a variety of financial services to individuals and businesses. [S2] N26 was founded in 2013 by Rocket Internet, an incubator, and operates in various European Union member states that are members of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). [S3] Their services include transaction accounts and debit cards, as well as overdraft and investment products under a subscription business model. [S4] The name of the company is derived from the number of smaller cubes in a complete Rubik's Cube, since a 3x3x3 cube has 26 individual visible cubes (27 minus 1 hidden). [S5] ## History\n\nFounded in August 2013 by Valentin Stalf and Maximilian Tayenthal as a fintech startup under the name Papayer GmbH, N26 initially offered a prepaid Mastercard financial management solution aimed at teenagers, which was launched in February 2014. [S6] During an interview with Business Insider later that year, the founders said that their service represented a niche market after receiving many inquiries regarding the availability of a similar service for adults. [S7] Subsequently, after securing \u20ac2 million in seed funding during June 2014, they changed their name to Number26 and discontinued the teenage finance service to work on a broader transaction account service for general use. [S8] N26 launched their banking product on October 20, 2014 in a private beta. [S9] Shortly after launch, they received \u20ac10 million in a Series A round, at which point the service has been available in Germany and Austria. [S10] During their initial operations, N26 did not hold a banking license; instead, it provided an interface to a backend provided by Wirecard. [S11] In July 2016, it re-branded as N26 Bank, after receiving a banking license they applied for 9 months prior by the German regulator BaFin. [S12] The company stated that they will start operating on their own infrastructure in autumn that year. [S13] At this point, they had over 200,000 customers. [S14] In June 2016, N26 terminated a number of customer accounts. [S15] The company said that reasons for these closures included suspected money laundering and excessive ATM withdrawals, with some customers making 15 to 30 withdrawals per month. [S16] N26 explained that while it offered free withdrawals, it incurred a cost of up to \u20ac2 per withdrawal in Germany, and that the volume of withdrawals by some users created a financial burden that could not be sustained across its customer base. [S17] The same month, N26 raised $40 million in a Series B round. [S18] When N26 started asking customers to transfer their accounts to the banks own infrastructure in November 2016, customers had to get a new account IBAN. [S19] Accounts previously held by Wirecard would be terminated. [S20] However, many customers reported issues during account migration, with many issues to get in touch with their customer support. [S21] N26 apologized and was transparent about what happened, saying they were overwhelmed by a large amount of customer support queries, even after initial preparation. [S22] However, they did not comment on other reported issues such as funds going missing and other software bugs. [S23] N26 made transaction accounts available across 17 Eurozone countries in December 2016. [S24] Shortly after, N26 reached more than 300,000 users in March 2017, at which point they were processing over 10 million credit card transactions per year, with a transaction volume of over \u20ac3 billion.",
    "[S25] Following this, N26 raised $160 million during a Series C round led by Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings and Allianz X (Allianz) in March 2018. [S26] During this time, N26 claimed to have a customer base of 850,000, aiming to have 5,000,000 customers by 2020. [S27] This was followed by an additional $300 million in funding in January 2019 as part of a Series D round led by Insight Partners with Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC and a few existing investors also participating, putting N26 at a valuation of $2.7 billion. [S28] With its new valuation, N26 overtook Revolut as the most valuable mobile bank in Europe. [S29] N26 started letting customers from the United States sign up for a waiting list on July 11, 2019. [S30] Due to the differences between EU and the US market, particularly in regards to regulatory schemes for financial providers, N26 partnered with Axos Financial to serve as the provider of its services, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. [S31] Unlike in Europe, where they are provided by MasterCard, N26 used Visa cards for U.S. [S32] customers. [S33] The following week, the company extended its series D round with an additional $170 million investment, valuing the company at $3.5 billion. [S34] In May 2020, the company announced the extension of its recent Series D round with an additional $100M raised at the same valuation. [S35] On 11 February 2020, N26 announced that it would cease doing business in the United Kingdom and close all accounts effective 15 April, due to the UK withdrawal from the European Union. [S36] The company cited the fact that European financial institutions can no longer operate in the region without applying for a banking license in the UK (rather than being allowed to operate under its EU license), as well as \"the timings and framework outlined in the EU Withdrawal Agreement\". [S37] Following internal conflicts between employees and the N26 management, the workers of N26's Berlin subsidiaries, N26 GmbH and N26 Operations GmbH, elected works councils to represent the employees of the Berlin offices in November and December 2020. [S38] The elections saw approximately 30% voter turnout, resulting in eleven elected works council members. [S39] These elections followed attempts to establish a works council in summer 2020, which were reportedly met with resistance from N26 management, including legal actions such as interim injunctions attempting to prevent employee meetings and the establishment of the electoral committee (\"Wahlvorstand\"). [S40] In January 2021 N26 announced the upcoming appointment of former ProSiebenSat.1 Media and Zalando executive Jan Kemper as the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. [S41] In January 2022, the bank announced that Kemper will also be taking over the role of Chief Operating Officer in addition to his role as CFO. [S42] In October 2021 N26 raised $900 million in a Series E round led by Third Point Ventures and Coatue Management, and joined by Dragoneer Investment Group as well as existing N26 investors. [S43] The funding round valued the digital bank at $9 billion. [S44] In November 2021 N26 announced that it would be pulling out of the United States in January 2022, leading to the closure of approximately 500,000 accounts. [S45] American customers were no longer be able to use its app after January 11, 2022. [S46] The withdrawal was to focus on N26's core European business. [S47] The company confirmed this in an official press release and N26's official corporate blog. [S48] In November 2022 N26 changed its legal form from a German Limited Liability Company (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung \u2013 GmbH) to a German Stock Corporation (Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 AG). [S49] At the same time, a five-member board of directors was appointed, chaired by Marcus W. [S50] Mosen. [S51] Other members are J\u00f6rg Gerbig, Dr. [S52] Barbara Roth, Dr. [S53] Julian Deutz and Dr. [S54] Robert Killian. [S55] In the first half of 2024, N26 partners with Upvest, an investment API provider, to launch a stock and ETF trading product. [S56] This product will initially debut in Austria before expanding to the German market. [S57] ## Company",
    "[S58] According to N26 it employs more than 1,500 people at its locations in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona, Belgrade, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Vienna, New York, Greece and S\u00e3o Paulo. [S59] ## Product overview\n\nN26 provides a free basic current account and a Debit MasterCard card to all its customers, as well as a Maestro card for their customers in certain markets. [S60] Additionally, customers can request overdraft and investment products. [S61] N26 also offers premium accounts (*N26 Smart*, *N26 You* and *N26 Metal*) which offer additional features for a monthly fee. [S62] The account opening process can be completed online via a photo/video identification. [S63] The video identification is performed by N26's identity verification partner, IDnow. [S64] The available verification method depends on the nationality, the country of residence, and the type of ID of the customer. [S65] ### Availability\n\nN26 offers its services in 24 European countries. [S66] In Austria, Germany and the Netherlands customers can additionally request a Maestro card. [S67] N26 closed its business in April 2020 in the UK. [S68] In November 2021, they also announced that they would pull out of the American market from January 2022 closing all (approx.) 500,000 accounts there. [S69] Some parts of the website and customer service are provided in English, German, French, Italian and Spanish regardless of the customer's residency. [S70] ### Mobile payments\n\nN26 customers in several of its markets can use their smartphone for in-store purchases. [S71] N26 supports Google Pay in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, while it supports Apple Pay in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. [S72] Additional countries are added as both Google Pay and Apple Pay gradually expand throughout N26's markets. [S73] ### Fees\n\nN26 has a basic account with no monthly fee and charges no fees for basic banking transactions or credit card payments in foreign currencies. [S74] In the Eurozone (except Austria and Italy) ATM withdrawals are limited to five per month for primary account holders and three per month for others. [S75] N26 charges a \u20ac2 fee for any additional withdrawal. [S76] ATM withdrawals in foreign currencies are also subject to a 1.70% fee for basic accounts and are free for N26 You and Metal account holders. [S77] German customers can also withdraw and deposit money at retail locations. [S78] While there is no fee for withdrawals up to \u20ac999, deposits are subject to a 1.5% fee. [S79] ### Security\n\nCustomers can lock and unlock their MasterCard through the mobile app without having to contact N26 support. [S80] They can also enable and disable it for usage abroad or online usage and modify the daily limits for cash withdrawals and card payments. [S81] Funds held in N26 accounts are also covered by all the requisite statutory requirements of a licensed bank, and are protected up to 100,000\u20ac under the German Deposit Protection scheme. [S82] ### Mobile transfers\n\nThe N26 app can scan the users' contacts in their smartphones and identify other N26 account holders. [S83] Using a service called Moneybeam an N26 customer can send funds to these contacts without having to fill in their IBAN. [S84] Moneybeam transfers are executed instantaneously at no cost. [S85] ## Controversies\n\n\n### Account closures",
    "[S86] In October 2022, it was reported that over 100 customers had their N26 bank accounts closed unexpectedly and without prior notice. [S87] One of several included a Ukrainian refugee named Anya Shamaieva fleeing the Russian war in Ukraine who was reported to have lost access to \u20ac15,000 and that N26 demanded she prove her identity in order to recover the funds. [S88] While many more customers continued to discover that their accounts had been unexpectedly frozen, N26 stated on their corporate blog that account closures, which the company refers to as \"blocks\", are made in order to prevent crimes from customers who pose a high-risk to the company. [S89] ### Anti-Money laundering compliance issues\n\nFollowing an inquiry made by several German medias reporting that it was possible to quickly open an N26 account with fake identity documents, the bank has been in German financial regulatory authority BaFin's sights since 2018. [S90] In May 2021 BaFin demanded that N26 take actions to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. [S91] And in June 2021, the bank was fined 4.25 million euros by BaFin for weaknesses in its anti-money laundering system. [S92] At least 50 transactions were suspicious and occurred between 2019 and 2020. [S93] The bank was too slow to report them to BaFin which prevented an efficient inquiry. [S94] BaFin also installed a supervisor in the bank. [S95] In 2022 the Bank of Italy halted N26 from taking on new customers after finding money laundering security violations. [S96] In addition to the ban on new customers, N26 was also prohibited from offering new products and services to already existing clients in Italy. [S97] These include crypto assets. [S98] In addition to the sanctions imposed by BaFin, as well as falling short on obligations to investors, German financial group Allianz announced its intentions to sell its 5% stake in N26 in April 2023. [S99] That same year in July, BaFin announced it would be extending its probationary supervision over N26 to ensure full compliance with anti-money laundering prevention. [S100] ### Business strategy\n\nIn the span of four years, N26 has entered and abruptly exited from the United Kingdom and the United States: two of the west's largest financial markets. [S101] N26 has gathered much criticism for its global expansion and growth strategy. [S102] In 2018, the company launched in the United Kingdom. [S103] Less than 2 years after launch, N26 announced it would discontinue its services in the UK citing Brexit as a driving factor for inability to continue their business with a license from a European Union member (Germany). [S104] Even though the referendum for Brexit was decided in the 2016, and the British government formally confirmed the results in 2017, N26 still cited this as the main driving reason for their departure from the British banking market in 2020. [S105] In 2019, N26 also launched its application in the US with banking services provided by Axos Financial. [S106] In November 2021, N26 ceased operations in the US to focus on the European market with account closures being finalized in early 2022. [S107] Despite these claims, Forbes magazine criticized N26 for failing in the US because of its refusal to offer innovative product to the already competitive and fast-paced American financial market. [S108] Shortly after telling its US customers of shifted priorities for the European sector, N26 launched in Brazil in May 2023 after announcing the launch to Latin America in 2019, entering the country in 2020, and finally testing the product in 2022. [S109] In March 2023 the company was heavily criticized for dysfunctional corporate governance. [S110] In addition to executive flaws, failure in the UK and US markets in addition to regulators in Italy and Germany sanctioning the company's growth contributed to a delay for the company to file for an initial public offering as well a further investment from outsider sources. [S111] ### Security incidents",
    "[S112] In December 2016 the research fellow in computer science from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg Vincent Haupert demonstrated how he could take advantage of security vulnerabilities in order to get access to N26 users' accounts. [S113] Haupert had already notified N26 of the vulnerabilities back in September 2016. [S114] N26 acknowledged the issues and claimed that they had been fixed before they became public, adding that no user account had actually been compromised. [S115] In March 2019 German media reported that customers who had their account credentials stolen found it difficult to contact the bank and resolve the situation. [S116] Customer advocates reported that there was a growing number of complaints from phishing victims who were unable to access their accounts and found it difficult to contact the bank. [S117] In a widely reported case N26 took more than two weeks to restore access for a customer who had \u20ac80,000 stolen from his account. [S118] The reports raised the question if the rapid growth of the bank had left it ill-equipped to deal with the increasing number of support cases. [S119] ### Works council\n\nN26 management drew public criticism for its opposition to the election of works councils at its Berlin-based subsidiaries, N26 GmbH and N26 Operations GmbH in August 2020. [S120] According to the employees, trust in management was on a historical low. [S121] Following employee announcements of a company-wide election to form an election committee (\"Wahlvorstand\"), N26 obtained a temporary injuction seeking to postpone the meeting, arguing that the COVID-19 hygiene concept did not meet the legal requirements. [S122] Trade unionists stated that infection protection regulations should not be used to obstruct unwanted employee representation. [S123] Johanna Wenckebach, Head of the labor law department at the Hugo Sinzheimer Institute, stated in an interview that hygiene regulations served as a pretext for preventing an event. [S124] She said that the company's subsequent organization of an alternative event demonstrated this. [S125] Wenckebach also stated that N26 management, in a widely circulated email, explicitly stated their opposition to a works council due to concerns about confrontations and process delays, saying \"it is against the values of N26\". [S126] To protect the named employees from further legal action, the trade union Ver.di stepped in to host the meeting at an outside venue. [S127] After N26 filed another injunction targeting Ver.di, IG Metall, another trade union organizing workers in the tech sector, called for the meeting instead. [S128] The election committee was established in a meeting that took place at the Hofbr\u00e4u Berlin. [S129] The company attempted to stop the meeting through legal means through a second injunction, claiming the venue lacked an adequate hygiene concept, but failed. [S130] During the meeting, the police were called over hygiene concerns, but found no violations of current COVID-19 safety measures after the venue operator, Bj\u00f6rn Schwarz, confirmed having an approved safety and hygiene plan. [S131] The founders of N26 criticized the takeover of the event by IG Metall, stating that any quickly organized election driven by external parties \"would not be inclusive, safe, or representative\". [S132] They stated their support for a works council but only under adherence to existing laws. [S133] They also announced that no further legal steps would be taken against the election process to de-escalate the situation. [S134] The works councils were established in November and December 2020, with a total voter turnout of around 30%. [S135] In response, CEO Valentin Stalf apologized in a blog post, stating that N26 supports the right of employees to formal representation. [S136] In May 2022 the employees elected a works council for the second time. [S137] According to a media report, members of the works council subsequently reported positive results."
