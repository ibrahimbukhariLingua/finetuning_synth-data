      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S58] Once Kahn's bill was introduced in the House, Mint Director George E. [S59] Roberts began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the commemorative issue. [S60] The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. [S61] All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the Commission of Fine Arts to recommend artists. [S62] Among those recommended were Adolph A. [S63] Weinman (who would design the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar in 1916), and Bela L. [S64] Pratt (creator of the 1908 Indian Head gold pieces). [S65] Others included sculptors Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Robert I. [S66] Aitken, Charles Keck, and Paul Manship. [S67] Roberts wrote to several of the sculptors, and found Aitken interested in creating the $50 pieces. [S68] The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with Buffalo nickel designer James Earl Fraser for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. [S69] Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. [S70] Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama\u2013Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. [S71] Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. [S72] The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. [S73] McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. [S74] All four artists were already at work, and Aitken responded to the notification of his hiring by submitting designs, which were similar to the actual coins. [S75] By January 29, all four artists had submitted bronze casts of their proposals.

[S77] Barber and others at the Philadelphia Mint (who offered suggestions). [S78] McAdoo had asked that the Mint prepare alternative designs for all the coins, and Barber did so, starting with the half dollar. [S79] Rejections to all four of the outside artists were sent on February 5 over McAdoo's signature. [S80] The reasons for this are uncertain, as the rejections are terse\u2014Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their volume on commemoratives, assert that Malburn's opposition was decisive. [S81] All four outside artists protested. [S82] Manship's objections were to no avail; McAdoo selected the design submitted by Barber for the half dollar. [S83] Longman asked for an explanation, submitted new designs, and came to Washington to discuss the matter. [S84] According to a letter several months later from Dewey, she fell ill there and was unable to participate further; numismatic historian Roger Burdette finds the explanation odd and suggests that there may have been some other reason. [S85] Barber was selected to design the quarter eagle. [S86] Both Atiken and Keck objected to the Commission of Fine Arts and to McAdoo; Keck also submitted additional designs. [S87] Both men met with McAdoo, Malburn and Dewey in Washington, and agreed to changes to their proposed designs. [S88] With that done, the $50 and $1 pieces were approved on March 6, 1915. [S89] The half dollar was approved two days later. [S90] Barber submitted his designs for the quarter eagle on March 16. [S91] They met an enthusiastic reception at the Treasury Department, and were approved. [S92] ## Designs\n\n\n### Barber's half dollar and quarter eagle\n\nPassage 2:\n[S190] The Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition Company hired Farran Zerbe to sell the new coins at the fair. [S191] Despite the provisions of the law mandating a delivery of coins before the fair's opening, the only government products Zerbe initially had to vend at his \"Money of the World\" exhibit were a souvenir medal, designed by Aitken and struck by a press operating at the Mint's exhibit, and prints produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, also on-site. [S192] Sales of the medal were slow, and Zerbe did not have coins to sell until soon after May 8, 1915, when the half dollar and dollar dies were received. [S193] Zerbe found the coins hard to sell; many potential purchasers, faced with a plethora of medals, reproductions of Gold Rush-era pioneer gold coins, and other wares from a variety of vendors, did not believe his coins were official government products. [S194] Treasury officials agreed to allow him space for a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, and the two lower denominations were sold there, with orders taken for the $50 pieces. [S195] Soon, though, Zerbe stopped selling the gold dollar there, and the rest of the fair's run was marked by conflict between him and Treasury representatives. [S196] The full legal allocation for each denomination had been struck, but though Zerbe continued selling coins by mail after the fair closed on December 4, 1915, sales dropped through 1916. [S197] Zerbe continued to sell coins on behalf of the exposition until at least November 1916, and at some point, he sold an unknown quantity to himself to supply the future needs of his coin business. [S198] The remainder were melted by the Treasury. [S199] The Mint struck 1,500 of each of the two $50 pieces, plus nine extra of the octagonal and ten of the round, to be sent to Philadelphia to await the 1916 meeting of the annual Assay Commission, when they would be available for inspection and testing. [S200] Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. [S201] A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200. [S202] Copper display frames with two of each coin were said by Slabaugh to have cost $400, but Swiatek, in his 2011 book on commemoratives, indicates that these sets may actually have been given to dignitaries, as no sales receipts or correspondence relating to them are known. [S203] A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each. [S204] ## Collecting and mintages\n\nMore of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. [S205] As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. [S206] commemorative coin, about 483\u2014the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed. [S207] The half dollar and dollar are known struck in different metals; pieces believed to have been struck to create rarities. [S208] The $50 pieces stood as the highest denomination U.S. [S209] coins for many years. [S210] In 1986, the Mint began producing the American Gold Eagle, also with face value $50. [S211] The record was surpassed with the American Platinum Eagle with a face value of $100, in 1997. [S212] R.S. [S213] Yeoman's *A Guide Book of United States Coins*, published in 2018, lists the Panama\u2013Pacific half dollar at between $375 and $2,500, depending on condition. [S214] The dollar lists at between $525 and $1,775 and the quarter eagle between $1,550 and $6,000. [S215] The round $50 piece lists for between about $55,000 and $240,000, and the octagonal for between $55,000 and $245,000 depending on condition.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the legal requirements for the Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins influenced the timeline and logistical challenges of their production and distribution. I need to look through the provided passages and find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan Passage 1. There's a mention of the authorizing act requiring the Mint to begin delivering coins by the fair's opening on February 20, 1915. However, this proved impractical, but the Mint still acted quickly. That seems like a key point about the timeline. Then, the timeline was tight, leading to rushed actions. Also, the legal requirements might have influenced the need for multiple designs and the involvement of various artists, which could have caused delays or challenges.\n\nLooking at the part where McAdoo approved the artists on January 21, 1915, and by January 29, the artists had submitted bronze casts. Then, the rejections on February 5, leading to changes. The approval of designs happened in March, which was after the fair's opening. This suggests that the legal deadline pushed the production schedule, causing last-minute changes and possible delays.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's mention of the legal allocation being struck, but Zerbe didn't have coins until May 8, 1915, which is after the fair started. The legal requirements might have caused delays in production, leading to coins being available late. Also, the distribution challenges are noted, like Zerbe struggling to sell them because people didn't believe they were official. The legal aspects of who could sell them and the distribution channels might have added logistical issues.\n\nAnother point is the requirement for different designs and the subsequent rejections and changes, which could have caused back-and-forth and delays. The fact that the Mint had to prepare alternative designs under the law might have added to the workload and time constraints.\n\nAlso, the part about the Mint striking 1,500 of each $50 piece and the distribution challenges, with some coins being melted later. The legal requirements for the number of coins to be produced and distributed might have led to overproduction or difficulties in managing the inventory.\n\nSo, putting this together, the legal requirements set a tight deadline (February 20, 1915), which forced the Mint to act quickly but led to impractical timelines. The need for multiple designs and the subsequent rejections and changes caused delays. The distribution faced challenges because of the late arrival of coins and issues with verifying their authenticity, which might be tied to legal stipulations about their sale and official status.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited properly. For example, the deadline in S72, the rushed actions, the rejections in S79, and the distribution issues in S192 and S193. Also, the part about the legal allocation in S196. I should structure the answer with each relevant sentence and their citations."

The octagonal shape of the $50 piece echoed historical precedents, such as private 19th-century octagonal coins like those by Augustus Humbert, which were not legal tender but circulated widely in California [S141][S143][S145][S23][S25].<cite>[S141][S143][S145][S23][S25]</cite></statement><statement>The dollar coin, designed by Charles Keck, depicted a Panama Canal construction worker to emphasize the labor and effort behind the canal, a central theme of the Exposition.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n# Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n\nThe five **Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins** were produced in connection with the 1915 Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. [S2] Struck at that city's mint, the issue included round and octagonal $50 pieces. [S3] Excepting modern bullion coins, these two gold pieces are the highest denomination ever issued and the largest coins ever struck by the United States Mint. [S4] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin to be issued that is not round. [S6] In January 1915, Congress passed legislation for a silver half dollar, as well as a gold dollar, quarter eagle ($2.50 piece), and two $50 pieces: one round and one octagonal. [S7] The Mint had already consulted artists. [S8] Treasury Secretary William G. [S9] McAdoo initially rejected all their designs. [S10] Two of them, Robert Ingersoll Aitken for the $50 pieces and Charles Keck for the gold dollar, persevered, and their submissions were used. [S11] The half dollar and quarter eagle were designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. [S12] Barber, possibly with the participation of his longtime assistant, George T. [S13] Morgan. [S14] The coins were vended at the Exposition by prominent numismatist Farran Zerbe. [S15] They did not sell well, and many of each denomination were returned for melting. [S16] Only a few hundred of each of the $50 pieces were distributed, making them the lowest-mintage commemorative coins. [S17] They catalog for up to $200,000, depending on condition. [S18] ## Background\n\nPrivate gold pieces, sometimes dubbed \"pioneer gold\", were struck several times during the 19th century from locally produced bullion in areas where federal coins were scarce. [S19] These unofficial coins came from sites ranging from Georgia to Oregon. [S20] Many, ranging in denomination from 25 cents to 50 dollars, are relics of the California Gold Rush and its aftermath. [S21] The fifty-dollar denomination was struck by private minters such as Kellogg and Co. [S22] The private $50 pieces were round in form, but those struck by Augustus Humbert for the U.S. [S23] Assay Office at San Francisco, prior to the establishment of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, were octagonal. [S24] Humbert's pieces were not money in a legal sense, as Congress had not authorized them as legal tender, and were officially deemed ingots. [S25] Nevertheless, they contained their full value in gold. [S26] Bearing the denomination \"Fifty Dollars\", they were called \"slugs\" or \"quintuple eagles\" by the public. [S27] They circulated widely in California and elsewhere in the Far West, and were accepted on par with federal gold coins. [S28] All of these $50 pieces, public or private, are very rare and valuable today: One of Humbert's octagonal pieces, dated 1851 and with a lettered edge, sold at auction in 2010 for $546,250. [S29] The only $50 piece produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint prior to 1915 was the 1877 pattern half union, produced experimentally at the Philadelphia Mint, though it was not approved as a circulating coin. [S30] In 1904, San Francisco merchant Rueben Hale proposed an exposition in his home city for 1915, both to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal and to mark the 400th anniversary of Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa becoming the first European known to view the Pacific Ocean from the Americas: in phrasing then current, he discovered the Pacific. [S31] Although the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire caused a momentary setback to these plans, it actually sparked additional fundraising. [S32] Many of the wealthiest in California gave financial support, the state matched private donations dollar for dollar, and in 1911, President William Howard Taft selected San Francisco over its competitor, New Orleans, to host the fair.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S125] Barber's quarter eagle (the first of that denomination issued as a commemorative) depicts, according to the Mint Director's report, \"Columbia, representing the United States, seated [on] the mythical sea horse [a hippocampus], riding through the waters of the canal, with caduceus in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting the nations of the world to use the new way from ocean to ocean. [S126] Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto 'E Pluribus Unum'\u00a0\". [S127] The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. [S128] Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S129] William C. [S130] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. [S131] They wrote that on the reverse, the \"defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device\". [S132] The obverse of the quarter eagle, Vermeule opined, derived from coins of ancient Greece depicting a \"Nereid, perhaps Thetis, who bears the shield of Achilles astride a hippocamp\". [S133] He suggested that the quarter eagle obverse \"may be Barber's answer to Theodore Roosevelt's and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' clamor for modern coins in the Greek manner\". [S134] The half dollar's reverse, along with that of the quarter eagle, \"are classic symphonies of old designs, motifs that trace back to the eagles and shields of [Charles Barber's predecessors as Chief Engraver] Longacre and William Barber revised into modern form.\"\n\n\n### Dollar and $50 pieces\n\nCharles Keck's obverse for the dollar was one of the alternative designs submitted to McAdoo, depicting the unadorned, capped head of a Panama Canal construction worker\u2014Keck's original concept had featured Poseidon, god of the sea in Greek mythology. [S135] The worker, who represents the labor necessary to build the canal, is sometimes mistaken for a baseball player. [S136] Keck's reverse contains the words \"Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition\", \"San Francisco\", the denomination of the coin, and two dolphins, symbolizing the joining of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the canal. [S137] The mint mark is beneath the letters D and O in \"Dollar\". [S138] Vermeule called Keck's dollar \"a novel, daring use of the limited area afforded by such a small, thin coin. [S139] Compared with the earlier gold dollars, the coin is a work of art.\" Numismatist Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the Panama\u2013Pacific dollar \"presents a bold American design, completely different from the classical styles used on the other denominations\". [S140] Aitken explained his design for the $50 pieces:\n\n> In order to express in my design the fact that this coin is struck to commemorate the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition, and as the exposition stands for all that wisdom and industry have produced, I have used as the central motive [motif] of the obverse, the head of the virgin goddess Minerva. [S141] She is the goddess of wisdom, of skill, of contemplation\u00a0... [S142] Moreover, she features prominently on the seal of the State of California\u00a0...

        "[S1] Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n# Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n\nThe five **Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins** were produced in connection with the 1915 Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. [S2] Struck at that city's mint, the issue included round and octagonal $50 pieces. [S3] Excepting modern bullion coins, these two gold pieces are the highest denomination ever issued and the largest coins ever struck by the United States Mint. [S4] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin to be issued that is not round. [S6] In January 1915, Congress passed legislation for a silver half dollar, as well as a gold dollar, quarter eagle ($2.50 piece), and two $50 pieces: one round and one octagonal. [S7] The Mint had already consulted artists. [S8] Treasury Secretary William G. [S9] McAdoo initially rejected all their designs. [S10] Two of them, Robert Ingersoll Aitken for the $50 pieces and Charles Keck for the gold dollar, persevered, and their submissions were used. [S11] The half dollar and quarter eagle were designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. [S12] Barber, possibly with the participation of his longtime assistant, George T. [S13] Morgan. [S14] The coins were vended at the Exposition by prominent numismatist Farran Zerbe. [S15] They did not sell well, and many of each denomination were returned for melting. [S16] Only a few hundred of each of the $50 pieces were distributed, making them the lowest-mintage commemorative coins. [S17] They catalog for up to $200,000, depending on condition. [S18] ## Background\n\nPrivate gold pieces, sometimes dubbed \"pioneer gold\", were struck several times during the 19th century from locally produced bullion in areas where federal coins were scarce. [S19] These unofficial coins came from sites ranging from Georgia to Oregon. [S20] Many, ranging in denomination from 25 cents to 50 dollars, are relics of the California Gold Rush and its aftermath. [S21] The fifty-dollar denomination was struck by private minters such as Kellogg and Co. [S22] The private $50 pieces were round in form, but those struck by Augustus Humbert for the U.S. [S23] Assay Office at San Francisco, prior to the establishment of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, were octagonal. [S24] Humbert's pieces were not money in a legal sense, as Congress had not authorized them as legal tender, and were officially deemed ingots. [S25] Nevertheless, they contained their full value in gold. [S26] Bearing the denomination \"Fifty Dollars\", they were called \"slugs\" or \"quintuple eagles\" by the public. [S27] They circulated widely in California and elsewhere in the Far West, and were accepted on par with federal gold coins. [S28] All of these $50 pieces, public or private, are very rare and valuable today: One of Humbert's octagonal pieces, dated 1851 and with a lettered edge, sold at auction in 2010 for $546,250. [S29] The only $50 piece produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint prior to 1915 was the 1877 pattern half union, produced experimentally at the Philadelphia Mint, though it was not approved as a circulating coin. [S30] In 1904, San Francisco merchant Rueben Hale proposed an exposition in his home city for 1915, both to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal and to mark the 400th anniversary of Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa becoming the first European known to view the Pacific Ocean from the Americas: in phrasing then current, he discovered the Pacific. [S31] Although the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire caused a momentary setback to these plans, it actually sparked additional fundraising. [S32] Many of the wealthiest in California gave financial support, the state matched private donations dollar for dollar, and in 1911, President William Howard Taft selected San Francisco over its competitor, New Orleans, to host the fair.",
        "[S125] Barber's quarter eagle (the first of that denomination issued as a commemorative) depicts, according to the Mint Director's report, \"Columbia, representing the United States, seated [on] the mythical sea horse [a hippocampus], riding through the waters of the canal, with caduceus in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting the nations of the world to use the new way from ocean to ocean. [S126] Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto 'E Pluribus Unum'\u00a0\". [S127] The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. [S128] Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S129] William C. [S130] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. [S131] They wrote that on the reverse, the \"defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device\". [S132] The obverse of the quarter eagle, Vermeule opined, derived from coins of ancient Greece depicting a \"Nereid, perhaps Thetis, who bears the shield of Achilles astride a hippocamp\". [S133] He suggested that the quarter eagle obverse \"may be Barber's answer to Theodore Roosevelt's and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' clamor for modern coins in the Greek manner\". [S134] The half dollar's reverse, along with that of the quarter eagle, \"are classic symphonies of old designs, motifs that trace back to the eagles and shields of [Charles Barber's predecessors as Chief Engraver] Longacre and William Barber revised into modern form.\"\n\n\n### Dollar and $50 pieces\n\nCharles Keck's obverse for the dollar was one of the alternative designs submitted to McAdoo, depicting the unadorned, capped head of a Panama Canal construction worker\u2014Keck's original concept had featured Poseidon, god of the sea in Greek mythology. [S135] The worker, who represents the labor necessary to build the canal, is sometimes mistaken for a baseball player. [S136] Keck's reverse contains the words \"Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition\", \"San Francisco\", the denomination of the coin, and two dolphins, symbolizing the joining of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the canal. [S137] The mint mark is beneath the letters D and O in \"Dollar\". [S138] Vermeule called Keck's dollar \"a novel, daring use of the limited area afforded by such a small, thin coin. [S139] Compared with the earlier gold dollars, the coin is a work of art.\" Numismatist Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the Panama\u2013Pacific dollar \"presents a bold American design, completely different from the classical styles used on the other denominations\". [S140] Aitken explained his design for the $50 pieces:\n\n> In order to express in my design the fact that this coin is struck to commemorate the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition, and as the exposition stands for all that wisdom and industry have produced, I have used as the central motive [motif] of the obverse, the head of the virgin goddess Minerva. [S141] She is the goddess of wisdom, of skill, of contemplation\u00a0... [S142] Moreover, she features prominently on the seal of the State of California\u00a0...

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the design choices for the Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins, including the $50 pieces and the dollar, reflected the themes of the 1915 Exposition and historical precedents in U.S. numismatics.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. The first part gives general information about the coins, their production, and some historical background. The second part, especially the sections about the dollar and $50 pieces, has detailed descriptions of the designs.\n\nLooking at the $50 pieces: The passage mentions that Robert Ingersoll Aitken designed them. His design includes Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, which ties into the themes of the Exposition emphasizing wisdom and industry. The owl on the reverse is also a symbol of wisdom, connecting to Minerva. The octagonal shape is noted as unique, possibly referencing historical precedents like the octagonal coins from the 19th century, such as those by Augustus Humbert. The use of Minerva also relates to the California state seal, linking to regional history.\n\nFor the dollar coin, Charles Keck's design features a Panama Canal construction worker, symbolizing labor and the effort behind the canal. The dolphins on the reverse represent the connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This design breaks from classical styles used in other coins, showing a more modern approach, which might reflect the Exposition's forward-looking themes.\n\nThe half dollar and quarter eagle designs are mentioned too. The quarter eagle's design includes Columbia on a hippocampus, symbolizing the canal's role in trade, and a caduceus for commerce. The reverse has an eagle on a standard, possibly alluding to World War I, which might tie into the historical context of the time. The half dollar's reverse uses classical motifs, showing a connection to older numismatic traditions.\n\nHistorical precedents include the private $50 pieces from the 19th century, like Humbert's octagonal coins, which the $50 pieces might have referenced. The $50 pieces' high denomination and large size also relate to previous high-value coins, though they are the highest ever issued by the Mint.\n\nI need to make sure each point is tied to specific sentences in the context. For example, the Minerva reference is in S141-S145. The octagonal shape is mentioned in S3 and S23. The construction worker design is in S135 and S136. The dolphins on the dollar are in S137. The historical precedents like Humbert's coins are in S23-S25. The use of classical motifs in other coins is in S125-S134 and S132.\n\nI should structure the answer by addressing each coin type, their design elements, and how they relate to the Exposition themes and historical numismatic practices. Each statement should have the relevant citations. Need to check that all citations are correctly numbered and that each sentence in the answer is properly tagged."

Let me start by scanning the text for mentions of artistic collaboration and design processes. \n\nIn the first passage, there's a mention that \"The Mint had already consulted artists\" [S7]. Then, Treasury Secretary McAdoo rejected their designs, but two artists, Robert Ingersoll Aitken and Charles Keck, persevered and their designs were used [S10]. Also, the half dollar and quarter eagle were designed by Charles E. Barber, possibly with George T. Morgan [S11-S13]. This shows that there was collaboration with artists and some revisions when initial designs were rejected.\n\nFor the $50 pieces, Aitken and Keck's designs were used after revisions. The passage also mentions that the designs were revised, like Keck's original concept had Poseidon but changed to a construction worker [S135]. This indicates that design revisions were part of the process.\n\nComparing to earlier U.S. coinage, the passage notes that earlier coins like the 1877 pattern half union were experimental but not circulated. The Panama\u2013Pacific coins had more collaboration with artists and specific design elements tied to the exposition. The dollar design by Keck was noted as different from classical styles used earlier [S140], suggesting a departure from previous styles. Also, the use of symbols like Minerva and the owl for wisdom, compared to earlier coins which might have been more classical or traditional.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For artistic collaboration, S7, S10, S11, S13, S135. For design revisions, S10, S135. Comparing to earlier coins, S140, and maybe S30 about the 1877 pattern.

The passage mentions that earlier coins like the half union were experimental but not circulated, and the Panama\u2013Pacific coins had more artistic input and specific themes. The dollar's design was different from classical styles, which might be a contrast to earlier coins that used more classical motifs.\n\nI need to structure the answer into two parts: the role of collaboration and revisions, and the comparison to earlier coins.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the design elements on the Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins and the mintage numbers for the $50 octagonal and round coins compared to other denominations as per the table.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. The first part has several sentences about the design elements. Let me go through each sentence to find relevant info.\n\nLooking at the first part, [S146] mentions the goddess wearing a crested helmet, similar to Pallas Athena. [S147] talks about the mail (armor), which was considered an anachronism. [S148] and [S149] mention the Roman numerals MCMXV for 1915 on the shield, which is the second use of Roman numerals on US coins. [S152] says the design on the octagonal piece is smaller to make space for the border with dolphins. [S153] notes the mint mark is on the reverse near the pine cone and above the \"O\" in \"San Francisco\". [S154] mentions the $50 coin's design received criticism, with dolphins implying the canal was for cetaceans. [S155] has Swiatek and Breen dismissing criticisms as irrelevant. [S158] and [S159] mention positive reviews of the $50 coins' design.\n\nSo the design elements include the goddess with a crested helmet, mail, Roman numerals MCMXV, an owl on a ponderosa pine, dolphins on the octagonal coin's border, and the mint mark location. The $50 octagonal and round coins have the dolphins, which was a point of criticism.\n\nNow, the mintage numbers are in Passage 2's table. The question asks how the $50 octagonal and round coins compare to other denominations. The table shows for the $50 octagonal and round, the mintage is 1,500 each. Other denominations like half dollar (60,000), gold dollar (25,000), quarter eagle (10,000). So the $50 coins have much lower mintage numbers. The table also includes assay coins, melted, and net distribution, but the key comparison is the mintage numbers. The user wants to know how the $50 coins' mintage compares, so the answer should state that they are significantly lower than the other denominations listed.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each design element should be a separate statement with relevant citations. Then, the mintage comparison should be another statement citing the table. Let me check the sentences again to make sure I have the right citations.\n\nFor design elements:\n- Crested helmet: [S146]\n- Mail: [S147]\n- Roman numerals MCMXV: [S148][S149]\n- Owl on ponderosa pine: [S151]\n- Dolphins on octagonal border: [S152][S154]\n- Mint mark location: [S153]\n- Criticisms and reviews: [S154][S155][S158][S159]\n\nFor mintage numbers, the table is in Passage 2, so the citation would be [S216]. But the user's question mentions \"as reflected in the provided table,\" so the answer should reference the table's data. However, the instructions say to cite sentence numbers. Since the table is in Passage 2, sentence [S216] is the table. So the mintage comparison statement would cite [S216].\n\nNow, I need to make sure each statement is correctly cited. Let me structure the answer accordingly."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the relation of Roman numerals on the $50 coin to U.S. coinage history and what the mintage data reveals about the significance of this design choice.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the $50 coin has the Roman numerals MCMXV for 1915, which is the second use of Roman numerals on U.S. coins after the 1907 Saint-Gaudens double eagle. That's in sentence S148. So the use of Roman numerals here connects to a previous instance, showing a continuity or a specific design choice in U.S. coinage.\n\nThen, the question also asks about the mintage data. Looking at Passage 2, there's a table with mintage numbers. The $50 octagonal and round coins each have a mintage of 1,500. The net distribution is 645 and 483 respectively, meaning a significant number were melted. The high number of melted coins (855 for octagonal and 1,017 for round) suggests that the coins weren't widely circulated, possibly due to their high value or commemorative nature. This might indicate that the design choice, including the Roman numerals, was more about symbolism than practical circulation, as the coins were not meant for everyday use but rather as collectibles or commemorative items.\n\nThe mintage data shows that the $50 coins had very low production numbers compared to other denominations. This low mintage, combined with the high meltage, suggests that the design was not intended for general circulation. The use of Roman numerals might have been a nod to classical themes, which were common in U.S. coinage at the time, but the low mintage indicates that these coins were more about commemoration than everyday use. The fact that it's the second use of Roman numerals might also highlight a deliberate choice to reference historical designs, possibly to add prestige or historical significance to the coin.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly placed. The part about Roman numerals is from S148 and S149. The mintage data is in Passage 2, but the specific sentences in the passage don't have citations for the table. However, the user's context might have the table as part of the passage, so maybe the table is considered part of the supporting context. Since the user's passage includes the table without specific citations, but the question is about the mintage data, I should reference the table as part of the supporting context. However, the original instructions say to cite sentence numbers. Since the table is in Passage 2, maybe the citations are S216? But the table itself isn't a sentence. Hmm, the user might expect that the table is part of the context, so perhaps the answer should mention the mintage numbers from the table without specific citations, but the instructions say to use sentence numbers. Since the table is in Passage 2, maybe the citation is [S216], but I'm not sure. The user's example shows that each statement has citations, so if the mintage data is part of the passage, perhaps the answer should reference the table's location. However, the user might not have provided sentence numbers for the table. The original passage's Passage 2 starts with [S216], which is the table. So maybe the mintage data is cited as [S216]. But the user's example might require that. So I'll have to go with that.\n\nPutting it all together: The use of Roman numerals on the $50 coin relates to U.S. coinage history as it's the second use after the 1907 double eagle. The mintage data shows low production and high meltage, indicating the design was significant as a commemorative piece rather than for circulation. Citations would be S148, S149 for the Roman numerals part, and S216 for the mintage data."

        "[S146] The goddess wears a crested helmet, as her Greek equivalent, Pallas Athena, was commonly depicted on ancient coins; it is pushed back to signify her peaceful intentions. [S147] She wears mail, which Swiatek and Breen found an odd anachronism. [S148] She bears upon her shield the Roman numerals MCMXV for the year 1915, the second use of Roman numerals on U.S. [S149] coins after the early types of the 1907 Saint-Gaudens double eagle. [S150] Though Aitken had originally expressed the date as \"1915\" in his original sketches, he soon changed his mind, \"As these designs will not be used in any other year, there will be no need to change the year as we must on other coins.\"\n\nKevin Flynn, in his book on commemorative coins, described the branch on which the owl perches as that of a ponderosa pine tree; several cones are visible. [S151] The design on the octagonal piece is smaller than on the round, to allow space for the border featuring the dolphins. [S152] The mint mark is on the reverse, adjacent to the rightmost pine cone and directly above the letter \"O\" in \"San Francisco\". [S153] The design for the $50 received contemporary criticism; some suggested that the presence of the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for cetacean convenience. [S154] A 1916 column in the *American Journal of Numismatics* contained the conclusion that \"the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted.\" Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as \"numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [S155] [McAdoo began it] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. [S156] coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us\". [S157] Vermeule deemed the $50 coins \"a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve\". [S158] Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were \"stylistically in step with the period [and have] considerable artistic merits\". [S159] Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. [S160] gold coins, deemed the Panama\u2013Pacific $50 pieces \"one of the most stunning issues ever produced by the U.S. [S161] government\". [S162] ## Production and distribution\n\nOnce the designs were approved, the artists prepared bronze casts to be sent to the Medallic Art Company in New York. [S163] There, hubs would be made that the Mint could use to produce coinage dies, as the company could do it faster than could the Mint.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the contrasting artistic evaluations of the Panama\u2013Pacific coins and how mintage numbers reflect the interplay between critical reception and production decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. The first part talks about the design elements and various critics' opinions. The second part has a table with mintage numbers.\n\nStarting with the artistic evaluations. The passage mentions that the $50 coins received contemporary criticism. For example, some thought the dolphins implied the canal was for cetaceans. There's a quote from the American Journal of Numismatics saying the coin isn't American except for the inscription. However, Swiatek and Breen dismissed those criticisms as irrelevant. Then there's Vermeule calling them a \"tour de force,\" and Elizabeth Jones saying they have artistic merits. Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth called them \"one of the most stunning issues.\" So there's a contrast between negative and positive reviews.\n\nNow, the mintage numbers. The table shows that the $50 octagonal and round had very low mintage (1,500 each). The half dollar had 60,000, gold dollar 25,000, etc. The question is how these numbers relate to the critical reception. If there were negative reviews, maybe the mintage was lower? But some of the criticisms were from people like McAdoo, but others like Vermeule and Jones praised them. However, the mintage for the $50 coins is much lower than other denominations. Maybe the mixed reception led to lower production? Or perhaps the $50 coins were more exclusive? Also, the fact that the $50 coins had a lot melted (855 and 1017) might indicate that they weren't circulated much, which could be due to their artistic value being more collectible rather than practical. \n\nBut the user wants to know how mintage numbers reflect the interplay between critical reception and production. So, even though there were both positive and negative reviews, the production numbers for the $50 coins were low. Maybe the negative criticism influenced the mintage, but the positive reviews might have led to some production. However, the table shows that the $50 coins had the lowest mintage. So perhaps the mixed reviews didn't strongly influence production, or other factors were at play. Alternatively, the low mintage could be due to the coins being commemorative and intended for collectors, not general circulation. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the contrasting evaluations, the relevant sentences are S154 (criticism about dolphins), S155 (Swiatek and Breen's dismissal), S158 (Vermeule's praise), S159 (Elizabeth Jones), S160-S162 (Garrett and Guth). For the mintage numbers, the table in Passage 2 is S216. The mintage numbers for the $50 coins are 1,500 each, which is much lower than other denominations. The melted numbers are also high, which might relate to their collectibility. \n\nSo the answer should mention the contrasting evaluations and link the mintage numbers to the critical reception. Even with some positive reviews, the mintage was low, possibly due to the controversial design or other factors. The citations would be the relevant sentences from the passage."

[S34] About 19,000,000 people attended, and the exposition was a great success, generating enough profit to build the San Francisco Civic Auditorium with about $1 million remaining. [S35] The Palace of Fine Arts is the only building from the fair which remains on the site. [S36] Commemorative coins were not then sold to the public by the Mint, as they subsequently have been.

[S44] Senate bill (S.) 6309 was introduced in that body by New Jersey Senator James E. [S45] Martine on July 6. [S46] This bill called for two $50 pieces (one round, one octagonal), a quarter eagle or $2.50 in gold, a commemorative gold dollar, and a half dollar. [S47] The octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush\n\nMartine's bill passed the Senate on August 3, having been approved by the Committee on Industrial Expositions, to which it had been referred.

[S52] 6309 was the following day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. [S53] It emerged from that committee on September 1, 1914, with several amendments, one of which increased the combined authorized mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. [S54] S. [S55] 6309 was briefly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and passed after Kahn successfully proposed a minor amendment to strike out the dollar sign from the phrase \"silver coins of the denomination of $50 cents each\".

[S170] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark \"S\", customary on coins produced there.

[S173] Upon learning that it was intentional\u2014Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, there was no need to use a mint mark\u2014Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [S174] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. [S175] Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without.

The user is asking about the significance of the legislative process for the Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins and how figures like Farran Zerbe and Senator Reed Smoot's objections reflect broader challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that commemorative coins were authorized through legislation, where a group would buy them from the Mint and sell to the public. Farran Zerbe is noted as a key figure who pushed for such legislation and had a controversial role in coin sales. Then there's the part about Senator Reed Smoot's procedural objection regarding the bill's referral to the wrong committee.\n\nThe significance of the legislative process here seems to be that it was a way to authorize the coins, with specific groups handling their sale. The involvement of Zerbe shows the role of numismatic promoters in pushing for these coins, even if there were controversies. Smoot's objection highlights procedural challenges in the legislative process, maybe about proper committee jurisdiction. \n\nI need to check the sentences that mention these points. For Zerbe, sentence S38 and S39 talk about his role and controversy. For Smoot, S48 and S49 mention his procedural objection. The legislative process's significance is covered in S37 and S38, explaining how the legislation worked. The broader challenges might be in the procedural objections and the involvement of key figures.\n\nSo, structuring the answer: first explain the legislative process's role, then Zerbe's involvement, then Smoot's objection.

[S94] Morgan should be credited for work on the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. [S95] Assistant Director Mary M. [S96] O'Reilly said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. [S97] Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by the very nature of Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is \"very obvious on both sides of both coins\". [S98] The employee concluded that \"no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. [S99] I am certain that this is correct.\" Q. [S100] David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. [S101] He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle. [S102] The obverse of the half dollar depicts columbia, who is scattering fruits and flowers from a cornucopia held by a small, nude child. [S103] Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's Golden Gate, as yet unadorned by its bridge. [S104] Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama\u2013Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate as a sign of good luck, and suggested it might have been better to depict it on a gold coin. [S105] The cornucopia, according to Burdette, demonstrates the advancement in trade brought by the canal, though the 1915 *Report of the Director of the Mint* states it \"signif[ies] the boundless resources of the West\". [S106] The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual Assay Commission. [S107] A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. [S108] San Francisco's mint mark, S, is to the left of the date. [S109] The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. [S110] The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an \"emblem of strength\". [S111] Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, \"McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins\". [S112] McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them\u2014the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches. [S113] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deemed the obverse of the half dollar \"a halfway point between the designs on French silver pieces early in the new century and A. [S114] A. [S115] Weinman's 'Walking Liberty' for the half dollar\". [S116] The fifty-cent piece bears the motto \"In God We Trust\", as do the $50 pieces, the first commemorative coins to display it. [S117] That motto was first used on U.S. [S118] coins in 1864. [S119] In the 19th century, it was not mandatory that the motto be used, but it nevertheless appeared on most denominations of U.S. [S120] coins by the turn of the 20th century. [S121] In 1907 and 1908, there had been many objections to the motto's omission on the gold ten dollar and twenty dollar pieces designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. [S122] In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. [S123] The wording on the Panama\u2013Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may have remembered the fracas.

[S100] David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. [S101] He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle. [S102] The obverse of the half dollar depicts columbia, who is scattering fruits and flowers from a cornucopia held by a small, nude child. [S103] Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's Golden Gate, as yet unadorned by its bridge. [S104] Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama\u2013Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate as a sign of good luck, and suggested it might have been better to depict it on a gold coin. [S105] The cornucopia, according to Burdette, demonstrates the advancement in trade brought by the canal, though the 1915 *Report of the Director of the Mint* states it \"signif[ies] the boundless resources of the West\". [S106] The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual Assay Commission. [S107] A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. [S108] San Francisco's mint mark, S, is to the left of the date. [S109] The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. [S110] The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an \"emblem of strength\". [S111] Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, \"McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins\". [S112] McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them\u2014the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches. [S113] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deemed the obverse of the half dollar \"a halfway point between the designs on French silver pieces early in the new century and A. [S114] A. [S115] Weinman's 'Walking Liberty' for the half dollar\". [S116] The fifty-cent piece bears the motto \"In God We Trust\", as do the $50 pieces, the first commemorative coins to display it. [S117] That motto was first used on U.S. [S118] coins in 1864. [S119] In the 19th century, it was not mandatory that the motto be used, but it nevertheless appeared on most denominations of U.S. [S120] coins by the turn of the 20th century. [S121] In 1907 and 1908, there had been many objections to the motto's omission on the gold ten dollar and twenty dollar pieces designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. [S122] In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. [S123] The wording on the Panama\u2013Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may have remembered the fracas. [S124] Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the ironic contrast highlighted by Swiatek and Breen regarding the symbolism of the reverse design of the half dollar and how it relates to the historical context of its issuance.\n\nFirst, I need to find where Swiatek and Breen are mentioned. Scanning through the passage, I see in sentence [S109]: \"Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I...\" So the key point here is the irony related to the reverse design. The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield with olive and oak branches. The olive branches symbolize peace, but the coin was issued during World War I, which is a time of war. That's the ironic contrast\u2014peace symbols on a coin minted during a war.\n\nNow, the historical context is World War I. The passage mentions that the coin was issued in 1915, which is during the war. The user wants to know how this relates. The answer should connect the peace symbolism (olive branches) with the fact that the country was involved in a war at the time. \n\nI need to check if there are other citations related to this. The sentence [S109] is the main one. The following sentence [S110] talks about the Mint Director's report calling oak an emblem of strength, but that's not directly related to the irony. The rest of the context discusses other design elements, but the key info is in [S109]. \n\nSo the answer should state that Swiatek and Breen found it ironic that the reverse design, which includes olive branches (symbolizing peace), was issued during World War I. The citation is [S109]. I need to make sure there are no other sentences contributing to this. The user also asked how this relates to the historical context, so mentioning World War I as the time of issuance is necessary."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the design and production challenges of the $50 commemorative coins, including the omission of the 'S' mint mark, relate to the broader context of the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition and the role of the San Francisco Mint.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Let me start by scanning for mentions of the $50 coins, the 'S' mint mark, and the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a lot about the legislation for the commemorative coins, including the bills introduced by various congressmen. The key part here might be the mention of the $50 pieces in S46, which talks about the octagonal and round coins. But the specific design challenges and mint mark issues are probably in Passage 2.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, S167 to S189. Here, there's a detailed account of the production issues. Specifically, S170 mentions that the San Francisco Mint's coiner found the dies lacked the 'S' mint mark. Then S173-175 explain that Joyce from Philadelphia thought it was intentional because the coins were being made in San Francisco, so no need for the 'S'. But Woolley was concerned about people thinking they were from Philadelphia, leading to the return of dies and re-production with the 'S' mark. Burdette's note in S175 mentions that omitting the 'S' would cause protests and possible varieties of coins. \n\nAlso, the production challenges: S183 mentions the San Francisco Mint's facilities were inadequate, so a hydraulic press was sent from Philadelphia. The striking of the coins happened on June 15, 1915, which is during the exposition period (Feb-Dec 1915). The exposition was a major event in San Francisco, and the coins were part of the commemorative efforts. The San Francisco Mint's role here is highlighted as they were responsible for production, but they faced technical challenges, which ties into the broader context of the exposition's need for significant and unique coins.\n\nSo, the omission of the 'S' mint mark was a design and production challenge because it was a point of contention due to the San Francisco Mint's pride. The broader context is that the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition needed commemorative items, and the San Francisco Mint was involved in producing these coins, but their facilities weren't up to the task, leading to logistical issues. The legislation for the coins (mentioned in Passage 1) was part of the exposition's fundraising and commemoration efforts. The design of the $50 coins, being large and octagonal, was a unique challenge, which relates to the exposition's significance as a major event requiring distinctive memorabilia.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with citations. The key points are:\n\n1. The omission of the 'S' mint mark was a production challenge, leading to re-dies being made with the mark (S170, S173-175, S175).\n2. The San Francisco Mint's inadequate facilities required a press from Philadelphia (S183).\n3. The production of the coins was part of the exposition's commemoration, with the coins being struck during the exposition period (S188, S189).\n4. The legislation for the coins (Passage 1) was tied to the exposition's fundraising and commemoration.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is correctly cited. For example, the part about the 'S' mint mark omission and the subsequent correction would cite S170, S173-175. The production challenges with the San Francisco Mint's facilities would cite S183. The connection to the exposition's context would be from the legislation parts (S46, S47, S57) and the timing of the coin production during the exposition (S188, S189). Also, the role of the San Francisco Mint in the broader context of the exposition's commemoration."

        "[S33] The Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition, constructed in San Francisco by the Golden Gate at a cost of $50 million, was open from February 20, 1915, to December 4, 1915. [S34] About 19,000,000 people attended, and the exposition was a great success, generating enough profit to build the San Francisco Civic Auditorium with about $1 million remaining. [S35] The Palace of Fine Arts is the only building from the fair which remains on the site. [S36] Commemorative coins were not then sold to the public by the Mint, as they subsequently have been. [S37] Instead, a commemorative's authorizing legislation would designate a group or organization to purchase the coins from the Mint at face value, and sell them to the public as a fundraiser. [S38] Among those who had pushed for commemorative legislation in the past, and had been involved in the sale of the resulting coins, was Farran Zerbe, a collector and numismatic promoter who had by 1914 served as president of the American Numismatic Association. [S39] Zerbe was a controversial figure\u2014some felt the coins with which he had been involved had been sold at inflated prices\u2014but he helped promote the hobby with his exhibit, \"Money of the World\", which later became part of the Chase Manhattan Money Museum. [S40] ## Legislation\n\nSeveral proposals for commemorative coins had been introduced by mid-1914, though none had been issued by the Mint since 1905. [S41] One, sponsored by New York Senator Elihu Root, called for a commemorative quarter dollar marking a century of peace, as well as the August 1914 opening of the Panama Canal. [S42] Two bills were introduced calling for coins to commemorate and benefit the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition; H.R. [S43] 16902 was introduced by California Congressman Julius Kahn on June 3, 1914. [S44] Senate bill (S.) 6309 was introduced in that body by New Jersey Senator James E. [S45] Martine on July 6. [S46] This bill called for two $50 pieces (one round, one octagonal), a quarter eagle or $2.50 in gold, a commemorative gold dollar, and a half dollar. [S47] The octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush\n\nMartine's bill passed the Senate on August 3, having been approved by the Committee on Industrial Expositions, to which it had been referred. [S48] The only objection was procedural, by Utah's Reed Smoot: that the bill should have instead been referred to and approved by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, or its Committee on Finance. [S49] Neither Smoot nor any other senator objected to the bill itself, which Martine indicated had the support of Treasury Secretary William G. [S50] McAdoo. [S51] S. [S52] 6309 was the following day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. [S53] It emerged from that committee on September 1, 1914, with several amendments, one of which increased the combined authorized mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. [S54] S. [S55] 6309 was briefly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and passed after Kahn successfully proposed a minor amendment to strike out the dollar sign from the phrase \"silver coins of the denomination of $50 cents each\". [S56] The Senate concurred in the House amendments two days later, passing the bill without question, change, or opposition, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law on January 16. [S57] ## Preparation",
        "[S167] By April, Robert W. [S168] Woolley had been commissioned as Director of the Mint, and he approved samples of the gold dollar, the first to have work completed, on April 22. [S169] He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. [S170] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark \"S\", customary on coins produced there. [S171] Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. [S172] Joyce on the 29th. [S173] Upon learning that it was intentional\u2014Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, there was no need to use a mint mark\u2014Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [S174] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. [S175] Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. [S176] New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. [S177] Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27. [S178] Containing 2.4286 troy ounces (2.6645\u00a0oz; 75.54\u00a0g) of gold and measuring 44.9 millimetres (1.77\u00a0in) across for the octagonal) and 43 millimetres (1.7\u00a0in) in diameter for the round, the $50 pieces were the largest and heaviest U.S. [S179] coins issued until surpassed in 2010 by the America the Beautiful silver bullion coins.

[S182] The facilities at the San Francisco Mint were inadequate to strike such large coins as the $50 pieces, and a hydraulic medal press was shipped from Philadelphia.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the octagonal $50 coin's design and production process reflected the goals of the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition and the technical challenges it posed.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition in several places. The key points about the coin are in Passage 2. \n\nThe octagonal design is mentioned in S179 and S180. It says the octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. coin that's not round. The design might have been meant to symbolize something unique, perhaps the exposition's theme of innovation or the Panama Canal. But the context doesn't explicitly state the goals of the exposition. However, since the coin was created for the exposition, its unique design likely aimed to commemorate the event's significance, maybe the canal's opening or the exposition's role in showcasing progress.\n\nRegarding the production process, S182 mentions that the San Francisco Mint's facilities were inadequate for the large coins. They had to ship a hydraulic medal press from Philadelphia. This indicates technical challenges in producing such large coins. Also, the size and shape (octagonal) would have required specialized equipment, which wasn't available locally. The process of striking the coins, like the ceremonial striking by dignitaries, might have been part of the exposition's promotional efforts.\n\nI need to check if there are other citations. S183 talks about the hydraulic press being shipped, which is a technical challenge. S184-189 describe the striking process, which might relate to the exposition's goals of public engagement. The fact that people could strike their own coins for $100 might have been a way to generate funds or promote the exposition.\n\nSo, the design (octagonal) reflects the exposition's goal of innovation and commemoration. The technical challenges include the need for a special press and the difficulty in producing such large coins. The citations would be S179, S180, S182, S183. Maybe S184-189 for the production process details. But the question is about the design and production process reflecting the goals. The goals aren't explicitly stated, but the coin's purpose was to benefit the exposition, so the unique design and production might have been to make it a memorable and significant commemorative item.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its own citations. Let me make sure I'm not missing any relevant sentences."

[S113] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deemed the obverse of the half dollar \"a halfway point between the designs on French silver pieces early in the new century and A. [S114] A. [S115] Weinman's 'Walking Liberty' for the half dollar\". [S116] The fifty-cent piece bears the motto \"In God We Trust\", as do the $50 pieces, the first commemorative coins to display it. [S117] That motto was first used on U.S. [S118] coins in 1864. [S119] In the 19th century, it was not mandatory that the motto be used, but it nevertheless appeared on most denominations of U.S. [S120] coins by the turn of the 20th century. [S121] In 1907 and 1908, there had been many objections to the motto's omission on the gold ten dollar and twenty dollar pieces designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. [S122] In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. [S123] The wording on the Panama\u2013Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may have remembered the fracas. [S124] Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the inclusion of \"In God We Trust\" on the Panama\u2013Pacific coins and how that relates to broader historical controversies about its use on U.S. currency, as well as the legislative action that influenced this decision.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage mentions that the fifty-cent piece and the $50 pieces were the first commemorative coins to display the motto. It also states that the motto was first used on U.S. coins in 1864. Then there's a part about objections in 1907 and 1908 regarding the omission of the motto on gold coins, leading to legislation in 1908 requiring its presence on certain coins. \n\nSo, the inclusion on the Panama\u2013Pacific coins might be related to avoiding controversy, as mentioned in the passage. The legislative action here is the 1908 law that required the motto on coins that previously had it. The broader controversy is about the use of the motto on gold coins, which led to the legislation. The Panama\u2013Pacific coins, being commemorative, might have included the motto to comply with this law and prevent similar objections.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The sentences about the 1908 legislation are [S122] and [S123]. The mention of the motto's first use is [S117] and [S118]. The part about the Panama\u2013Pacific coins including the motto is [S116]. The part about the 1907-1908 objections is [S121] and [S122]. The legislative action is in [S123]. The part about the Treasury officials remembering the fracas is [S124], which might tie into the decision to include the motto.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should connect the inclusion of the motto on the Panama\u2013Pacific coins to the 1908 legislation that required it on certain coins, thereby avoiding controversy. The citations would be [S116][S117][S118][S121][S122][S123][S124]."

[S92] ## Designs\n\n\n### Barber's half dollar and quarter eagle\n\nPassage 2:\n[S190] The Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition Company hired Farran Zerbe to sell the new coins at the fair. [S191] Despite the provisions of the law mandating a delivery of coins before the fair's opening, the only government products Zerbe initially had to vend at his \"Money of the World\" exhibit were a souvenir medal, designed by Aitken and struck by a press operating at the Mint's exhibit, and prints produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, also on-site. [S192] Sales of the medal were slow, and Zerbe did not have coins to sell until soon after May 8, 1915, when the half dollar and dollar dies were received. [S193] Zerbe found the coins hard to sell; many potential purchasers, faced with a plethora of medals, reproductions of Gold Rush-era pioneer gold coins, and other wares from a variety of vendors, did not believe his coins were official government products. [S194] Treasury officials agreed to allow him space for a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, and the two lower denominations were sold there, with orders taken for the $50 pieces. [S195] Soon, though, Zerbe stopped selling the gold dollar there, and the rest of the fair's run was marked by conflict between him and Treasury representatives. [S196] The full legal allocation for each denomination had been struck, but though Zerbe continued selling coins by mail after the fair closed on December 4, 1915, sales dropped through 1916. [S197] Zerbe continued to sell coins on behalf of the exposition until at least November 1916, and at some point, he sold an unknown quantity to himself to supply the future needs of his coin business. [S198] The remainder were melted by the Treasury. [S199] The Mint struck 1,500 of each of the two $50 pieces, plus nine extra of the octagonal and ten of the round, to be sent to Philadelphia to await the 1916 meeting of the annual Assay Commission, when they would be available for inspection and testing. [S200] Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. [S201] A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200. [S202] Copper display frames with two of each coin were said by Slabaugh to have cost $400, but Swiatek, in his 2011 book on commemoratives, indicates that these sets may actually have been given to dignitaries, as no sales receipts or correspondence relating to them are known. [S203] A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each. [S204] ## Collecting and mintages\n\nMore of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. [S205] As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. [S206] commemorative coin, about 483\u2014the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed. [S207] The half dollar and dollar are known struck in different metals; pieces believed to have been struck to create rarities. [S208] The $50 pieces stood as the highest denomination U.S. [S209] coins for many years. [S210] In 1986, the Mint began producing the American Gold Eagle, also with face value $50. [S211] The record was surpassed with the American Platinum Eagle with a face value of $100, in 1997. [S212] R.S. [S213] Yeoman's *A Guide Book of United States Coins*, published in 2018, lists the Panama\u2013Pacific half dollar at between $375 and $2,500, depending on condition. [S214] The dollar lists at between $525 and $1,775 and the quarter eagle between $1,550 and $6,000.

[S200] Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. [S201] A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200. [S202] Copper display frames with two of each coin were said by Slabaugh to have cost $400, but Swiatek, in his 2011 book on commemoratives, indicates that these sets may actually have been given to dignitaries, as no sales receipts or correspondence relating to them are known. [S203] A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each. [S204] ## Collecting and mintages\n\nMore of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. [S205] As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. [S206] commemorative coin, about 483\u2014the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed. [S207] The half dollar and dollar are known struck in different metals; pieces believed to have been struck to create rarities. [S208] The $50 pieces stood as the highest denomination U.S. [S209] coins for many years. [S210] In 1986, the Mint began producing the American Gold Eagle, also with face value $50. [S211] The record was surpassed with the American Platinum Eagle with a face value of $100, in 1997. [S212] R.S. [S213] Yeoman's *A Guide Book of United States Coins*, published in 2018, lists the Panama\u2013Pacific half dollar at between $375 and $2,500, depending on condition. [S214] The dollar lists at between $525 and $1,775 and the quarter eagle between $1,550 and $6,000. [S215] The round $50 piece lists for between about $55,000 and $240,000, and the octagonal for between $55,000 and $245,000 depending on condition.",

        "[S58] Once Kahn's bill was introduced in the House, Mint Director George E. [S59] Roberts began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the commemorative issue. [S60] The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. [S61] All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the Commission of Fine Arts to recommend artists. [S62] Among those recommended were Adolph A. [S63] Weinman (who would design the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar in 1916), and Bela L. [S64] Pratt (creator of the 1908 Indian Head gold pieces). [S65] Others included sculptors Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Robert I. [S66] Aitken, Charles Keck, and Paul Manship. [S67] Roberts wrote to several of the sculptors, and found Aitken interested in creating the $50 pieces. [S68] The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with Buffalo nickel designer James Earl Fraser for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. [S69] Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. [S70] Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama\u2013Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. [S71] Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. [S72] The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. [S73] McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. [S74] All four artists were already at work, and Aitken responded to the notification of his hiring by submitting designs, which were similar to the actual coins. [S75] By January 29, all four artists had submitted bronze casts of their proposals. [S76] Dewey forwarded them to McAdoo, who solicited advice from the Commission of Fine Arts (which liked them), his Assistant Secretary, William Malburn (who did not), and Chief Engraver Charles E. [S77] Barber and others at the Philadelphia Mint (who offered suggestions). [S78] McAdoo had asked that the Mint prepare alternative designs for all the coins, and Barber did so, starting with the half dollar. [S79] Rejections to all four of the outside artists were sent on February 5 over McAdoo's signature. [S80] The reasons for this are uncertain, as the rejections are terse\u2014Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their volume on commemoratives, assert that Malburn's opposition was decisive. [S81] All four outside artists protested. [S82] Manship's objections were to no avail; McAdoo selected the design submitted by Barber for the half dollar. [S83] Longman asked for an explanation, submitted new designs, and came to Washington to discuss the matter. [S84] According to a letter several months later from Dewey, she fell ill there and was unable to participate further; numismatic historian Roger Burdette finds the explanation odd and suggests that there may have been some other reason. [S85] Barber was selected to design the quarter eagle. [S86] Both Atiken and Keck objected to the Commission of Fine Arts and to McAdoo; Keck also submitted additional designs. [S87] Both men met with McAdoo, Malburn and Dewey in Washington, and agreed to changes to their proposed designs. [S88] With that done, the $50 and $1 pieces were approved on March 6, 1915. [S89] The half dollar was approved two days later. [S90] Barber submitted his designs for the quarter eagle on March 16. [S91] They met an enthusiastic reception at the Treasury Department, and were approved. [S92] ## Designs\n\n\n### Barber's half dollar and quarter eagle",
        "[S190] The Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition Company hired Farran Zerbe to sell the new coins at the fair. [S191] Despite the provisions of the law mandating a delivery of coins before the fair's opening, the only government products Zerbe initially had to vend at his \"Money of the World\" exhibit were a souvenir medal, designed by Aitken and struck by a press operating at the Mint's exhibit, and prints produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, also on-site. [S192] Sales of the medal were slow, and Zerbe did not have coins to sell until soon after May 8, 1915, when the half dollar and dollar dies were received. [S193] Zerbe found the coins hard to sell; many potential purchasers, faced with a plethora of medals, reproductions of Gold Rush-era pioneer gold coins, and other wares from a variety of vendors, did not believe his coins were official government products. [S194] Treasury officials agreed to allow him space for a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, and the two lower denominations were sold there, with orders taken for the $50 pieces. [S195] Soon, though, Zerbe stopped selling the gold dollar there, and the rest of the fair's run was marked by conflict between him and Treasury representatives. [S196] The full legal allocation for each denomination had been struck, but though Zerbe continued selling coins by mail after the fair closed on December 4, 1915, sales dropped through 1916. [S197] Zerbe continued to sell coins on behalf of the exposition until at least November 1916, and at some point, he sold an unknown quantity to himself to supply the future needs of his coin business. [S198] The remainder were melted by the Treasury. [S199] The Mint struck 1,500 of each of the two $50 pieces, plus nine extra of the octagonal and ten of the round, to be sent to Philadelphia to await the 1916 meeting of the annual Assay Commission, when they would be available for inspection and testing. [S200] Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. [S201] A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200.

[S203] A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each. [S204] ## Collecting and mintages\n\nMore of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the sales challenges faced by Farran Zerbe at the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition reflect broader issues with the distribution and perception of the commemorative coins. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The relevant passage is Passage 2, which talks about Zerbe's role in selling the coins. Let me go through the sentences in that passage to find clues.\n\nStarting with [S190], it mentions that Zerbe was hired to sell the coins. Then [S191] says that despite the law requiring delivery before the fair, he initially only had a souvenir medal and prints. This suggests that the distribution wasn't timely, which could be a broader issue. \n\n[S192] states that sales of the medal were slow and he didn't have coins until May 8. This delay might indicate problems in the distribution chain. Then [S193] explains that potential buyers didn't believe the coins were official, pointing to a perception issue. \n\n[S194] mentions that Treasury allowed a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, but later conflicts arose. This could show coordination problems between different entities. [S195] notes that sales dropped after the fair, and [S196] mentions Zerbe sold some to himself, implying that the coins weren't selling well, which relates to distribution and market acceptance. \n\n[S197] and [S198] talk about the remainder being melted, which might indicate overproduction or poor sales strategies. The part about the $50 pieces having low distribution [S205]-[S207] shows that even after the fair, the coins weren't widely distributed, which is a broader issue. \n\nThe perception issue is highlighted in [S193] where people didn't believe the coins were official. Also, the mention of many vendors with similar items (medals, reproductions) in [S193] suggests that the coins were not distinct enough, affecting their perceived value. \n\nSo, the challenges Zerbe faced\u2014like delayed distribution, perception of authenticity, and difficulty in selling due to competition and lack of official recognition\u2014reflect broader issues. The citations would be [S191], [S193], [S195], [S196], [S205]-[S207]. I need to make sure each sentence in the answer is properly cited."

    "[S1] Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n# Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n\nThe five **Panama\u2013Pacific commemorative coins** were produced in connection with the 1915 Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. [S2] Struck at that city's mint, the issue included round and octagonal $50 pieces. [S3] Excepting modern bullion coins, these two gold pieces are the highest denomination ever issued and the largest coins ever struck by the United States Mint. [S4] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin to be issued that is not round. [S6] In January 1915, Congress passed legislation for a silver half dollar, as well as a gold dollar, quarter eagle ($2.50 piece), and two $50 pieces: one round and one octagonal. [S7] The Mint had already consulted artists. [S8] Treasury Secretary William G. [S9] McAdoo initially rejected all their designs. [S10] Two of them, Robert Ingersoll Aitken for the $50 pieces and Charles Keck for the gold dollar, persevered, and their submissions were used. [S11] The half dollar and quarter eagle were designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. [S12] Barber, possibly with the participation of his longtime assistant, George T. [S13] Morgan. [S14] The coins were vended at the Exposition by prominent numismatist Farran Zerbe. [S15] They did not sell well, and many of each denomination were returned for melting. [S16] Only a few hundred of each of the $50 pieces were distributed, making them the lowest-mintage commemorative coins. [S17] They catalog for up to $200,000, depending on condition. [S18] ## Background\n\nPrivate gold pieces, sometimes dubbed \"pioneer gold\", were struck several times during the 19th century from locally produced bullion in areas where federal coins were scarce. [S19] These unofficial coins came from sites ranging from Georgia to Oregon. [S20] Many, ranging in denomination from 25 cents to 50 dollars, are relics of the California Gold Rush and its aftermath. [S21] The fifty-dollar denomination was struck by private minters such as Kellogg and Co. [S22] The private $50 pieces were round in form, but those struck by Augustus Humbert for the U.S. [S23] Assay Office at San Francisco, prior to the establishment of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, were octagonal. [S24] Humbert's pieces were not money in a legal sense, as Congress had not authorized them as legal tender, and were officially deemed ingots. [S25] Nevertheless, they contained their full value in gold. [S26] Bearing the denomination \"Fifty Dollars\", they were called \"slugs\" or \"quintuple eagles\" by the public. [S27] They circulated widely in California and elsewhere in the Far West, and were accepted on par with federal gold coins. [S28] All of these $50 pieces, public or private, are very rare and valuable today: One of Humbert's octagonal pieces, dated 1851 and with a lettered edge, sold at auction in 2010 for $546,250. [S29] The only $50 piece produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint prior to 1915 was the 1877 pattern half union, produced experimentally at the Philadelphia Mint, though it was not approved as a circulating coin. [S30] In 1904, San Francisco merchant Rueben Hale proposed an exposition in his home city for 1915, both to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal and to mark the 400th anniversary of Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa becoming the first European known to view the Pacific Ocean from the Americas: in phrasing then current, he discovered the Pacific. [S31] Although the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire caused a momentary setback to these plans, it actually sparked additional fundraising. [S32] Many of the wealthiest in California gave financial support, the state matched private donations dollar for dollar, and in 1911, President William Howard Taft selected San Francisco over its competitor, New Orleans, to host the fair.",
    "[S33] The Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition, constructed in San Francisco by the Golden Gate at a cost of $50 million, was open from February 20, 1915, to December 4, 1915. [S34] About 19,000,000 people attended, and the exposition was a great success, generating enough profit to build the San Francisco Civic Auditorium with about $1 million remaining. [S35] The Palace of Fine Arts is the only building from the fair which remains on the site. [S36] Commemorative coins were not then sold to the public by the Mint, as they subsequently have been. [S37] Instead, a commemorative's authorizing legislation would designate a group or organization to purchase the coins from the Mint at face value, and sell them to the public as a fundraiser. [S38] Among those who had pushed for commemorative legislation in the past, and had been involved in the sale of the resulting coins, was Farran Zerbe, a collector and numismatic promoter who had by 1914 served as president of the American Numismatic Association. [S39] Zerbe was a controversial figure\u2014some felt the coins with which he had been involved had been sold at inflated prices\u2014but he helped promote the hobby with his exhibit, \"Money of the World\", which later became part of the Chase Manhattan Money Museum. [S40] ## Legislation\n\nSeveral proposals for commemorative coins had been introduced by mid-1914, though none had been issued by the Mint since 1905. [S41] One, sponsored by New York Senator Elihu Root, called for a commemorative quarter dollar marking a century of peace, as well as the August 1914 opening of the Panama Canal. [S42] Two bills were introduced calling for coins to commemorate and benefit the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition; H.R. [S43] 16902 was introduced by California Congressman Julius Kahn on June 3, 1914. [S44] Senate bill (S.) 6309 was introduced in that body by New Jersey Senator James E. [S45] Martine on July 6. [S46] This bill called for two $50 pieces (one round, one octagonal), a quarter eagle or $2.50 in gold, a commemorative gold dollar, and a half dollar. [S47] The octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush\n\nMartine's bill passed the Senate on August 3, having been approved by the Committee on Industrial Expositions, to which it had been referred. [S48] The only objection was procedural, by Utah's Reed Smoot: that the bill should have instead been referred to and approved by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, or its Committee on Finance. [S49] Neither Smoot nor any other senator objected to the bill itself, which Martine indicated had the support of Treasury Secretary William G. [S50] McAdoo. [S51] S. [S52] 6309 was the following day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. [S53] It emerged from that committee on September 1, 1914, with several amendments, one of which increased the combined authorized mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. [S54] S. [S55] 6309 was briefly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and passed after Kahn successfully proposed a minor amendment to strike out the dollar sign from the phrase \"silver coins of the denomination of $50 cents each\". [S56] The Senate concurred in the House amendments two days later, passing the bill without question, change, or opposition, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law on January 16. [S57] ## Preparation",
    "[S58] Once Kahn's bill was introduced in the House, Mint Director George E. [S59] Roberts began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the commemorative issue. [S60] The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. [S61] All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the Commission of Fine Arts to recommend artists. [S62] Among those recommended were Adolph A. [S63] Weinman (who would design the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar in 1916), and Bela L. [S64] Pratt (creator of the 1908 Indian Head gold pieces). [S65] Others included sculptors Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Robert I. [S66] Aitken, Charles Keck, and Paul Manship. [S67] Roberts wrote to several of the sculptors, and found Aitken interested in creating the $50 pieces. [S68] The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with Buffalo nickel designer James Earl Fraser for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. [S69] Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. [S70] Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama\u2013Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. [S71] Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. [S72] The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. [S73] McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. [S74] All four artists were already at work, and Aitken responded to the notification of his hiring by submitting designs, which were similar to the actual coins. [S75] By January 29, all four artists had submitted bronze casts of their proposals. [S76] Dewey forwarded them to McAdoo, who solicited advice from the Commission of Fine Arts (which liked them), his Assistant Secretary, William Malburn (who did not), and Chief Engraver Charles E. [S77] Barber and others at the Philadelphia Mint (who offered suggestions). [S78] McAdoo had asked that the Mint prepare alternative designs for all the coins, and Barber did so, starting with the half dollar. [S79] Rejections to all four of the outside artists were sent on February 5 over McAdoo's signature. [S80] The reasons for this are uncertain, as the rejections are terse\u2014Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their volume on commemoratives, assert that Malburn's opposition was decisive. [S81] All four outside artists protested. [S82] Manship's objections were to no avail; McAdoo selected the design submitted by Barber for the half dollar. [S83] Longman asked for an explanation, submitted new designs, and came to Washington to discuss the matter. [S84] According to a letter several months later from Dewey, she fell ill there and was unable to participate further; numismatic historian Roger Burdette finds the explanation odd and suggests that there may have been some other reason. [S85] Barber was selected to design the quarter eagle. [S86] Both Atiken and Keck objected to the Commission of Fine Arts and to McAdoo; Keck also submitted additional designs. [S87] Both men met with McAdoo, Malburn and Dewey in Washington, and agreed to changes to their proposed designs. [S88] With that done, the $50 and $1 pieces were approved on March 6, 1915. [S89] The half dollar was approved two days later. [S90] Barber submitted his designs for the quarter eagle on March 16. [S91] They met an enthusiastic reception at the Treasury Department, and were approved. [S92] ## Designs\n\n\n### Barber's half dollar and quarter eagle",
    "[S93] To what extent Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) George T. [S94] Morgan should be credited for work on the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. [S95] Assistant Director Mary M. [S96] O'Reilly said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. [S97] Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by the very nature of Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is \"very obvious on both sides of both coins\". [S98] The employee concluded that \"no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. [S99] I am certain that this is correct.\" Q. [S100] David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. [S101] He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle. [S102] The obverse of the half dollar depicts columbia, who is scattering fruits and flowers from a cornucopia held by a small, nude child. [S103] Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's Golden Gate, as yet unadorned by its bridge. [S104] Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama\u2013Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate as a sign of good luck, and suggested it might have been better to depict it on a gold coin. [S105] The cornucopia, according to Burdette, demonstrates the advancement in trade brought by the canal, though the 1915 *Report of the Director of the Mint* states it \"signif[ies] the boundless resources of the West\". [S106] The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual Assay Commission. [S107] A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. [S108] San Francisco's mint mark, S, is to the left of the date. [S109] The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. [S110] The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an \"emblem of strength\". [S111] Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, \"McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins\". [S112] McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them\u2014the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches. [S113] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule deemed the obverse of the half dollar \"a halfway point between the designs on French silver pieces early in the new century and A. [S114] A. [S115] Weinman's 'Walking Liberty' for the half dollar\". [S116] The fifty-cent piece bears the motto \"In God We Trust\", as do the $50 pieces, the first commemorative coins to display it. [S117] That motto was first used on U.S. [S118] coins in 1864. [S119] In the 19th century, it was not mandatory that the motto be used, but it nevertheless appeared on most denominations of U.S. [S120] coins by the turn of the 20th century. [S121] In 1907 and 1908, there had been many objections to the motto's omission on the gold ten dollar and twenty dollar pieces designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. [S122] In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. [S123] The wording on the Panama\u2013Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may have remembered the fracas. [S124] Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy.",
    "[S125] Barber's quarter eagle (the first of that denomination issued as a commemorative) depicts, according to the Mint Director's report, \"Columbia, representing the United States, seated [on] the mythical sea horse [a hippocampus], riding through the waters of the canal, with caduceus in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting the nations of the world to use the new way from ocean to ocean. [S126] Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto 'E Pluribus Unum'\u00a0\". [S127] The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. [S128] Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S129] William C. [S130] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. [S131] They wrote that on the reverse, the \"defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device\". [S132] The obverse of the quarter eagle, Vermeule opined, derived from coins of ancient Greece depicting a \"Nereid, perhaps Thetis, who bears the shield of Achilles astride a hippocamp\". [S133] He suggested that the quarter eagle obverse \"may be Barber's answer to Theodore Roosevelt's and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' clamor for modern coins in the Greek manner\". [S134] The half dollar's reverse, along with that of the quarter eagle, \"are classic symphonies of old designs, motifs that trace back to the eagles and shields of [Charles Barber's predecessors as Chief Engraver] Longacre and William Barber revised into modern form.\"\n\n\n### Dollar and $50 pieces\n\nCharles Keck's obverse for the dollar was one of the alternative designs submitted to McAdoo, depicting the unadorned, capped head of a Panama Canal construction worker\u2014Keck's original concept had featured Poseidon, god of the sea in Greek mythology. [S135] The worker, who represents the labor necessary to build the canal, is sometimes mistaken for a baseball player. [S136] Keck's reverse contains the words \"Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition\", \"San Francisco\", the denomination of the coin, and two dolphins, symbolizing the joining of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the canal. [S137] The mint mark is beneath the letters D and O in \"Dollar\". [S138] Vermeule called Keck's dollar \"a novel, daring use of the limited area afforded by such a small, thin coin. [S139] Compared with the earlier gold dollars, the coin is a work of art.\" Numismatist Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the Panama\u2013Pacific dollar \"presents a bold American design, completely different from the classical styles used on the other denominations\". [S140] Aitken explained his design for the $50 pieces:\n\n> In order to express in my design the fact that this coin is struck to commemorate the Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition, and as the exposition stands for all that wisdom and industry have produced, I have used as the central motive [motif] of the obverse, the head of the virgin goddess Minerva. [S141] She is the goddess of wisdom, of skill, of contemplation\u00a0... [S142] Moreover, she features prominently on the seal of the State of California\u00a0... [S143] the use of the dolphins on the octagonal coin do much to add to its charm, as well as express the uninterrupted water route made possible by the canal. [S144] Upon the reverse I use the owl, the bird sacred to Minerva, also the symbol of wisdom\u00a0... [S145] With these simple symbols, all full of beauty in themselves, I feel that I have expressed the larger meaning of the exposition, its appeal to the intellect.",
    "[S146] The goddess wears a crested helmet, as her Greek equivalent, Pallas Athena, was commonly depicted on ancient coins; it is pushed back to signify her peaceful intentions. [S147] She wears mail, which Swiatek and Breen found an odd anachronism. [S148] She bears upon her shield the Roman numerals MCMXV for the year 1915, the second use of Roman numerals on U.S. [S149] coins after the early types of the 1907 Saint-Gaudens double eagle. [S150] Though Aitken had originally expressed the date as \"1915\" in his original sketches, he soon changed his mind, \"As these designs will not be used in any other year, there will be no need to change the year as we must on other coins.\"\n\nKevin Flynn, in his book on commemorative coins, described the branch on which the owl perches as that of a ponderosa pine tree; several cones are visible. [S151] The design on the octagonal piece is smaller than on the round, to allow space for the border featuring the dolphins. [S152] The mint mark is on the reverse, adjacent to the rightmost pine cone and directly above the letter \"O\" in \"San Francisco\". [S153] The design for the $50 received contemporary criticism; some suggested that the presence of the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for cetacean convenience. [S154] A 1916 column in the *American Journal of Numismatics* contained the conclusion that \"the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted.\" Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as \"numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [S155] [McAdoo began it] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. [S156] coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us\". [S157] Vermeule deemed the $50 coins \"a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve\". [S158] Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were \"stylistically in step with the period [and have] considerable artistic merits\". [S159] Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. [S160] gold coins, deemed the Panama\u2013Pacific $50 pieces \"one of the most stunning issues ever produced by the U.S. [S161] government\". [S162] ## Production and distribution\n\nOnce the designs were approved, the artists prepared bronze casts to be sent to the Medallic Art Company in New York. [S163] There, hubs would be made that the Mint could use to produce coinage dies, as the company could do it faster than could the Mint. [S164] The Panama\u2013Pacific issues are the first American coins known to have been produced from hubs provided by a private company\u2014the Medallic Art Company prepared hubs for the 1913 Buffalo nickel, but it is uncertain if they were used. [S165] The Panama\u2013Pacific hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where the Engraving Department, headed by Barber, would produce the necessary dies. [S166] Although the authorizing statute required that the coins be struck in San Francisco, all coinage dies at that time were produced by Barber and his assistants in Philadelphia.",
    "[S167] By April, Robert W. [S168] Woolley had been commissioned as Director of the Mint, and he approved samples of the gold dollar, the first to have work completed, on April 22. [S169] He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. [S170] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark \"S\", customary on coins produced there. [S171] Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. [S172] Joyce on the 29th. [S173] Upon learning that it was intentional\u2014Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, there was no need to use a mint mark\u2014Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [S174] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. [S175] Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. [S176] New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. [S177] Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27. [S178] Containing 2.4286 troy ounces (2.6645\u00a0oz; 75.54\u00a0g) of gold and measuring 44.9 millimetres (1.77\u00a0in) across for the octagonal) and 43 millimetres (1.7\u00a0in) in diameter for the round, the $50 pieces were the largest and heaviest U.S. [S179] coins issued until surpassed in 2010 by the America the Beautiful silver bullion coins. [S180] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S181] coin that is not round. [S182] The facilities at the San Francisco Mint were inadequate to strike such large coins as the $50 pieces, and a hydraulic medal press was shipped from Philadelphia. [S183] This press was ceremoniously operated at that mint on June 15, 1915 for the initial striking of $50 octagonal pieces; the first by San Francisco Mint Superintendent T. [S184] W. [S185] H. [S186] Shanahan, for presentation to the exposition's president, Charles C. [S187] Moore. [S188] The next nine were struck by other dignitaries, including Congressman Kahn. [S189] Anyone else present with the price of $100 per coin was then allowed to strike their own piece, and at least three people, including Dewey's wife and the local postmaster, did so.",
    "[S190] The Panama\u2013Pacific Exposition Company hired Farran Zerbe to sell the new coins at the fair. [S191] Despite the provisions of the law mandating a delivery of coins before the fair's opening, the only government products Zerbe initially had to vend at his \"Money of the World\" exhibit were a souvenir medal, designed by Aitken and struck by a press operating at the Mint's exhibit, and prints produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, also on-site. [S192] Sales of the medal were slow, and Zerbe did not have coins to sell until soon after May 8, 1915, when the half dollar and dollar dies were received. [S193] Zerbe found the coins hard to sell; many potential purchasers, faced with a plethora of medals, reproductions of Gold Rush-era pioneer gold coins, and other wares from a variety of vendors, did not believe his coins were official government products. [S194] Treasury officials agreed to allow him space for a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, and the two lower denominations were sold there, with orders taken for the $50 pieces. [S195] Soon, though, Zerbe stopped selling the gold dollar there, and the rest of the fair's run was marked by conflict between him and Treasury representatives. [S196] The full legal allocation for each denomination had been struck, but though Zerbe continued selling coins by mail after the fair closed on December 4, 1915, sales dropped through 1916. [S197] Zerbe continued to sell coins on behalf of the exposition until at least November 1916, and at some point, he sold an unknown quantity to himself to supply the future needs of his coin business. [S198] The remainder were melted by the Treasury. [S199] The Mint struck 1,500 of each of the two $50 pieces, plus nine extra of the octagonal and ten of the round, to be sent to Philadelphia to await the 1916 meeting of the annual Assay Commission, when they would be available for inspection and testing. [S200] Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. [S201] A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200. [S202] Copper display frames with two of each coin were said by Slabaugh to have cost $400, but Swiatek, in his 2011 book on commemoratives, indicates that these sets may actually have been given to dignitaries, as no sales receipts or correspondence relating to them are known. [S203] A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each. [S204] ## Collecting and mintages\n\nMore of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. [S205] As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. [S206] commemorative coin, about 483\u2014the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed. [S207] The half dollar and dollar are known struck in different metals; pieces believed to have been struck to create rarities. [S208] The $50 pieces stood as the highest denomination U.S. [S209] coins for many years. [S210] In 1986, the Mint began producing the American Gold Eagle, also with face value $50. [S211] The record was surpassed with the American Platinum Eagle with a face value of $100, in 1997. [S212] R.S. [S213] Yeoman's *A Guide Book of United States Coins*, published in 2018, lists the Panama\u2013Pacific half dollar at between $375 and $2,500, depending on condition. [S214] The dollar lists at between $525 and $1,775 and the quarter eagle between $1,550 and $6,000. [S215] The round $50 piece lists for between about $55,000 and $240,000, and the octagonal for between $55,000 and $245,000 depending on condition.",
