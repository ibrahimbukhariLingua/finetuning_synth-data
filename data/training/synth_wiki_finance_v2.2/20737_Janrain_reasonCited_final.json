      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S57] In June 2014, the company launched \"Janrain User-Generated Content\" (\"Janrain UGC\"); according to *Adweek*, the service \"allows brands to give their fans the ability to interact, comment on, and chat about content on their sites\u00a0... [S58] [and] allowing them to easily discover friends\u2019 activities on those sites\" and \"better create personalized brand experiences\". [S59] Features include comments, activity streams, live chat, social post curation, and redesigned social sharing. [S60] The firm's \"Social Profile Navigator\" provides users with an overview of the data they are sharing on social media sites. [S61] Arktan, which Janrain acquired in 2014, developed technology that analyzes Facebook data and enables comments, polls, reviews, and other services. [S62] Arktan had also developed social television technology and partnered with Facebook in India to generate on-air and online graphics using data from Facebook Keyword Insights API during the 2014 Indian Premier League cricket event. [S63] ### Jyte\n\n**Jyte** was a community-based website created by JanRain in late January 2007, named as an acronym for \"Just You Tell 'Em\". [S64] According to the developers, Jyte allowed users to \"make claims about [themselves], others, or just about anything\". [S65] These \"claims\" consisted of a headline and, optionally, a short text body. [S66] They could also be assigned user-selected tags. [S67] A claim was presented as a declarative sentence. [S68] Site users could then vote on it by selecting whether they agree or disagree. [S69] The total number of people who have voted, as well as their votes, were displayed with the claim. [S70] Users could also leave comments on claims, with or without voting. [S71] One article described Jyte as an example of the \"democracy of the internet,\" which \"can appear to give rise to some amazing insights.\"\n\nIn addition, users could give each other \"cred\". [S72] Cred consisted of a short word or phrase, such as a tag, that applied to a user. [S73] For example, if user Bob made a valid claim about darts, user Mary might assign him \"darts\" cred. [S74] Receiving cred increased the recipient user's \"cred score\". [S75] Cred was designed to give an idea of how trustworthy a user was in a given area, as well as his or her interests. [S76] Jyte was developed primarily with Ruby on Rails, and was interoperable with other sites by means of several APIs. [S77] It relied solely on OpenID for user authentication. [S78] The use of one's OpenID in multiple websites and environments and the creation of a non-anonymous, portable, weighted, and persistent online reputation could provide advantages to a user in future discussions in other online and off line contexts. [S79] Jyte was described as a source of arbitrary opinions. [S80] The website is since extinct. [S81] It was acquired by \"AboutUs\" in 2010, and sometime later wholly ceased to exist. [S82] ## Reception\n\n*Inc.* ranked Janrain number 264, number 455, number 723, and number 1,412 in its annual \"Inc. [S83] 5000 Rank\" for 2012 to 2015, respectively. [S84] The magazine's \"Inc.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Janrain's product launches and industry recognitions in 2014-2015 reflected their focus on social media and user-generated content.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and identify the relevant information. The passage mentions several things. Let's start with the product launches. \n\nIn June 2014, Janrain launched \"Janrain User-Generated Content\" (Janrain UGC). The description says it allows brands to let fans interact, comment, chat, and discover friends' activities. That's definitely related to social media and user-generated content. The features listed include comments, activity streams, live chat, social post curation, and redesigned social sharing. These all tie into social media engagement. Also, the Social Profile Navigator gives users an overview of their social media data, which is another point.\n\nThen there's the mention of Arktan, which they acquired in 2014. Arktan's tech analyzes Facebook data and enables comments, polls, reviews. They also did social TV tech and partnered with Facebook during the 2014 Indian Premier League. That shows they were involved in social media analytics and integrating social features into events, which is part of their focus.\n\nNow, the industry recognitions. The passage lists several rankings. Inc. ranked them in the 5000 Rank for 2012-2015, and in 2015 they were a Five-Time Inc. 5000 Honoree. Also, they were named a winner of the CRM Watchlist 2014. Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 rankings in 2014 and 2015 with high growth rates. These recognitions indicate they were well-regarded in the tech and CRM sectors, which likely relates to their focus on social media and user-generated content.\n\nBut I need to make sure each point is tied back to social media and user-generated content. The product launches directly mention UGC and social features. The acquisitions and partnerships (like with Facebook) also support that. The recognitions might not explicitly mention social media, but the context of their products and services would imply that. However, the question is about how the product launches and recognitions reflect their focus. So the recognitions are probably because of their work in those areas.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each relevant sentence and cite the correct numbers. Let me check the passage again to ensure I didn't miss any details. The Jyte part is from 2007 and was acquired in 2010, so that's before 2014-2015, so maybe not relevant here. The key points are the 2014 UGC launch, Arktan's role, and the industry rankings.\n\nSo the answer should mention the UGC product with its features, the Social Profile Navigator, Arktan's Facebook integration, and the industry recognitions like CRM Watchlist and Deloitte rankings. Each of these points should be in separate statements with their citations."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S31] The company's headquarters are in the Dekum Building at 519 Southwest Third Avenue in downtown Portland. [S32] Janrain moved into the building in 2009, occupying the sixth floor, which it vacated and moved into three others in February 2013. [S33] According to *Portland Business Journal*, much of the office space's \"funky\" modern and Romanesque architecture existed previously, though some updates were made when the company relocated. [S34] The space has an open design with glass walls for offices, a game room, a spiral staircase connecting the two floors, and an atrium extending up to an eighth floor skylight. [S35] It also has quiet, private spaces for nursing mothers, telephone calls, or work rooms. [S36] Conference rooms on one floor are named after mountains in the Pacific Northwest, while those on another level are named for Portland's bridges. [S37] Janrain turned the basketball court on the building's fourth floor, left by the previous occupant Wieden+Kennedy, into a conference room and meeting space. [S38] Janrain is open to remote work, which the *Portland Business Journal* said is unique in Portland. [S39] The company has satellite offices in Frankfurt, London, and Paris.

[S51] Janrain's services were used by more than 350,000 websites by January 2013.

[S56] Janrain hired technology attorney Lewis Barr to serve as vice president for \"legal and privacy matters\", and to inform clients about the appropriate and legal collection of digital information.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Janrain\n\n\n# Janrain\n\n\n\n**Janrain**, sometimes styled as **JanRain**, is a customer profile and identity management (CIAM) software provider based in Portland, Oregon, United States. [S2] It was established in 2002. [S3] Akamai acquired Janrain in January 2019. [S4] ## History\n\nJanrain was founded in Portland in 2002 by Larry Drebes, who as of 2016\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49 is the company's chief technology officer (CTO), and former chief executive officer (CEO). [S5] The firm's name \"references a wet January in Portland\", and has been described as a \"leading provider of customer profile and identity management\". [S6] According to *Forbes*, Drebes recognized the value of social media in 2004 and predicted the need for users to manage their online identities. [S7] He helped create the OpenID protocol, which has been called a \"decentralized authentication method for the new Web\". [S8] Janrain was a founding member of the OpenID Foundation and has advocated for OpenID. [S9] As a privately held company, Janrain has grown steadily since its inception. [S10] In December 2009, Janrain raised US$3.25 million from American venture capital firms DFJ Frontier, RPM Ventures, and Anthem Venture Partners. [S11] According to TechCrunch, the firms invested in Janrain's ability to \"effectively mass market and sell authentication systems to website publishers based on OpenID and other online identity technologies\". [S12] *The Oregonian* and VentureBeat have reported that Janrain had 60 employees by mid-2011. [S13] In August 2011, the company announced a $15.5 million funding round led by Emergence Capital Partners, which was used for hiring staff and marketing. [S14] Emergence founder Brian Jacobs joined Janrain's board of directors. [S15] That month, the company had funding totaling $18.7 million from the four venture capital firms, as well as from Timothy C. [S16] Draper, and Drebes. [S17] Janrain's sales \"more than doubled\" in 2012, and the company expected a quicker sales growth rate for 2013. [S18] Janrain had 170 employees by January 2013. [S19] That month, the firm received $33 million in new investment, marking one of the largest venture capital rounds for an Internet company in Oregon. [S20] Funding was led by Millennium Technology Value Partners, with additional participation by DFJ Frontier and RPM Ventures, existing investors Emergence Capital and Anthem Venture Partners, plus Epic Ventures, Salesforce.com, and Split Rock Partners. [S21] Including the 2013 investment, which was more than twice the amount of any venture investment in Oregon in 2012, Janrain had raised $52\u201353 million, and was noted as one of the \"best-funded young technology\" businesses in the state. [S22] The company reportedly planned to use the money to employ salespeople and engineers, enhance its technology, add new features to its software, and enter markets outside the U.S. [S23] In February 2013, the Austin, Texas-based company Umbel announced its partnership with Janrain to combine the former company's \"real-time audience insights\" technology with the latter's \"User Management Platform, providing actionable intelligence from rich social data, in real-time\". [S24] In December 2014, Janrain acquired the startup company Arktan for an undisclosed amount. [S25] Janrain began offering data services developed by both companies, which had worked together for \"several years\" before the acquisition. [S26] According to *Advertising Age*, Janrain had grown to 160 employees; Drebes said there would be no executive changes for Arktan's five employees. [S27] *Inc.* reported that Janrain earned $14.3 million in revenue in 2014, had a three-year growth rate of 294%, and employed 135 people\u201444 more than the previous year. [S28] In 2015, the firm expanded its international reach by building a new data center in China. [S29] In September 2015, *Portland Business Journal* said Janrain employed \"around 120, most of them in Portland\", and had raised $52.8 million to date from investors. [S30] In December 2015, the company secured an additional $27 million in their Series D funding, led by HighBar Partners.",

The user is asking how Janrain's office space in Portland reflected the company's cultural values and operational requirements, and what unique features were included in its design.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions several details about the office space. Let me scan through the sentences again.\n\nLooking at the first passage, there are several sentences about the office. For example, [S34] talks about the open design with glass walls, a game room, a spiral staircase, and an atrium. These elements might relate to cultural values like openness and collaboration. The game room could indicate a relaxed, creative environment. The spiral staircase and atrium might be unique design features that promote interaction.\n\nThen, [S35] mentions quiet, private spaces for nursing mothers, phone calls, or work rooms. This suggests the company values employee well-being and work-life balance, which are part of their cultural values. \n\n[S36] says conference rooms are named after mountains and bridges in the Pacific Northwest, which might reflect a connection to local culture and geography, emphasizing community and regional identity. \n\n[S37] mentions converting a basketball court into a conference room. That's a unique feature, showing adaptability and perhaps a playful approach to space utilization. \n\n[S38] states that Janrain is open to remote work, which is unique in Portland. This reflects operational flexibility and trust in employees, aligning with modern work practices. \n\nI need to make sure these points are connected to cultural values and operational requirements. The open design and game room support a collaborative and innovative culture. Private spaces show consideration for employee needs. The naming of conference rooms ties into local culture. The basketball court conversion is a unique design choice. Remote work flexibility addresses operational needs for modern work arrangements.\n\nNow, check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. [S31] mentions the location, but not the design. [S32] talks about moving floors, but not the design features. [S33] mentions the architecture being funky and modern, which could relate to a creative culture. \n\nSo, compiling this, the answer should include the open design, game room, spiral staircase, atrium, private spaces, conference room names, basketball court conversion, and remote work policy. Each of these elements reflects cultural values like collaboration, creativity, employee well-being, and operational needs like flexibility and space efficiency.\n\nCitations would be [S34], [S35], [S36], [S37], [S38], and maybe [S33] for the funky architecture. But the question is about the design features, so the specific sentences about the design elements are key. Need to make sure each statement is correctly cited."

[S11] According to TechCrunch, the firms invested in Janrain's ability to \"effectively mass market and sell authentication systems to website publishers based on OpenID and other online identity technologies\". [S12] *The Oregonian* and VentureBeat have reported that Janrain had 60 employees by mid-2011.

[S21] Including the 2013 investment, which was more than twice the amount of any venture investment in Oregon in 2012, Janrain had raised $52\u201353 million, and was noted as one of the \"best-funded young technology\" businesses in the state. [S22] The company reportedly planned to use the money to employ salespeople and engineers, enhance its technology, add new features to its software, and enter markets outside the U.S. [S23] In February 2013, the Austin, Texas-based company Umbel announced its partnership with Janrain to combine the former company's \"real-time audience insights\" technology with the latter's \"User Management Platform, providing actionable intelligence from rich social data, in real-time\".

There are two passages here. Let me start by scanning each passage for financial milestones. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section titled \"History\" which mentions several funding rounds. In December 2009, they raised $3.25 million from some venture capital firms. Then in August 2011, there's a $15.5 million funding round. Later, in January 2013, they received $33 million. Then in December 2015, another $27 million in Series D funding. These are all financial milestones. \n\nAlso, in Passage 1, there's mention of clients like EMI Music, Fox News, etc., but that's more about clients than financial milestones. The technology section talks about their products but not directly about funding. \n\nNow, the question also asks how these investments contributed to expansion and tech development. The context mentions that the 2011 funding was used for hiring staff and marketing. The 2013 investment was for employing salespeople, engineers, enhancing tech, adding features, and entering new markets. The 2015 expansion into China's data center is mentioned, which might be part of their international growth. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the 2009 funding is cited as [S11], the 2011 funding as [S14], the 2013 funding as [S20], and the 2015 funding as [S30]. The contributions to expansion and tech development are in [S18], [S23], and [S29]. \n\nWait, the 2013 funding's use is mentioned in [S23], and the 2015 expansion in [S29]. Also, the 2011 funding's use is in [S14] and [S16]. \n\nI need to structure each sentence with the correct citations. Let me check each point:\n\n- 2009: $3.25M [S11]\n- 2011: $15.5M [S14], and total funding up to $18.7M [S16]\n- 2013: $33M [S20], leading to 170 employees [S19], and use of funds for sales, engineers, tech, etc. [S23]\n- 2015: $27M Series D [S30], and expansion to China [S29]\n\nAlso, the acquisition of Arktan in 2014 [S25] might be part of their tech development, but the question is about financial milestones, so maybe that's not directly a financial milestone but an acquisition. However, the funding rounds are the key financial milestones.\n\nSo, the answer should list each funding round with the amounts and years, and then the contributions. Each sentence needs to have the correct citations. I need to make sure not to miss any citations and that each statement is properly attributed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how Janrain's technology evolved from 2009 to 2013 and the role partnerships played in expanding its capabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me start by scanning each section for relevant information.\n\nStarting with the Technology section in Passage 1. There's mention of RPX as their flagship product, which was a SaaS platform for OpenID. By December 2009, over 170,000 websites used it. Then in 2012, they launched a one-click sharing mechanism for Facebook. By January 2013, over 350,000 websites used their services. Also, Janrain Engage, Capture, and Federate were mentioned, which handle social sharing, profile data, and single sign-on. The User Management Platform (JUMP) was introduced, providing a unified user view across properties. Their social login tech expanded to include more social media sites, allowing marketers to target ads based on user data.\n\nNow, looking at partnerships. In Passage 2, there's a mention of Umbel's partnership in February 2013. They combined Umbel's real-time audience insights with Janrain's User Management Platform. Also, in December 2014, they acquired Arktan, but that's after 2013. However, the question is up to 2013, so the Umbel partnership is relevant. Additionally, the funding rounds and investments from venture capital firms might indicate partnerships, but the question specifically asks about partnerships expanding capabilities, so the Umbel collaboration is key here.\n\nAlso, in Passage 1 under Clients, there's a list of clients added over the years, which shows growth, but not directly about technology evolution. The expansion of their client base might be due to their technology improvements and partnerships.\n\nSo, putting it together: From 2009 to 2013, Janrain's technology evolved with the expansion of their SaaS platform, introduction of one-click sharing, and the JUMP platform. Partnerships like with Umbel in 2013 helped integrate real-time data insights, enhancing their capabilities. The funding rounds might have supported these developments, but the direct partnerships are the Umbel one.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly referenced. The Umbel partnership is in Passage 2, S24. The technology evolution points are in Passage 1: S48, S49, S51, S52, S53, S54, S55. Also, the JUMP platform is mentioned in the Technology section. The client list shows growth, but maybe not directly part of the tech evolution. The partnerships are specifically the Umbel one. Also, the acquisition of Arktan is in 2014, so not relevant here.\n\nSo the answer should mention the expansion of their products, the one-click sharing, JUMP, and the Umbel partnership. Each of these points needs citations from the relevant sentences."

[S24] In December 2014, Janrain acquired the startup company Arktan for an undisclosed amount. [S25] Janrain began offering data services developed by both companies, which had worked together for \"several years\" before the acquisition. [S26] According to *Advertising Age*, Janrain had grown to 160 employees; Drebes said there would be no executive changes for Arktan's five employees. [S27] *Inc.* reported that Janrain earned $14.3 million in revenue in 2014, had a three-year growth rate of 294%, and employed 135 people\u201444 more than the previous year. [S28] In 2015, the firm expanded its international reach by building a new data center in China. [S29] In September 2015, *Portland Business Journal* said Janrain employed \"around 120, most of them in Portland\", and had raised $52.8 million to date from investors.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of Jim Kaskade's leadership as CEO on Janrain's trajectory and how his departure in 2019 relates to his role at Conversica.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Jim Kaskade joining Janrain as CEO in April 2016 (S40) and then being hired by Conversica in late 2019 (S41). However, there's no direct information about the impact of his leadership on Janrain's trajectory. The context does talk about Janrain's growth, funding, acquisitions, and expansions, but none of those details are explicitly linked to Kaskade's leadership. The company was acquired by Akamai in 2019 (S3), which is mentioned in Passage 2. His departure in 2019 might be related to the acquisition, but the context doesn't state that. The only connection is that he left Janrain and joined Conversica around that time. \n\nSo, the answer should note that the impact of his leadership isn't detailed in the provided context. The departure in 2019 is mentioned, and his subsequent role at Conversica is noted, but there's no explanation of the relationship between the two. The citations would be S40 and S41 for the facts about his roles. Since there's no info on the impact, that part can't be answered with the given data."

The user is asking about the purpose of Jyte's 'cred' system and how it related to Janrain's broader approach to user authentication and online reputation management.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage mentions Jyte in several sentences. Let me scan through the sentences related to Jyte. \n\nStarting from [S64], the passage introduces Jyte as a community-based site by JanRain. Then, [S72] talks about users giving each other \"cred\". The next sentences explain that cred is a short word or phrase, like a tag, applied to a user. For example, if Bob makes a valid claim about darts, Mary might assign him \"darts\" cred. Receiving cred increases the user's \"cred score\". Then [S76] states that cred was designed to give an idea of how trustworthy a user was in a given area and their interests. \n\nSo the purpose of the 'cred' system seems to be to establish trustworthiness and interests of users based on their contributions. Now, how does this relate to Janrain's broader approach? The passage mentions that Jyte used OpenID for authentication and that the use of OpenID across multiple sites could create a portable, weighted, and persistent online reputation. This ties into Janrain's broader efforts in user authentication and reputation management. \n\nLooking at [S78] and [S79], it says Jyte relied on OpenID for authentication and that using OpenID in multiple environments could provide advantages in future discussions. This suggests that Janrain's approach was about creating a consistent online identity and reputation that users could carry across different platforms, which is part of their broader strategy. \n\nSo the 'cred' system was a way to build reputation through user interactions, and this fit into Janrain's larger plan of using OpenID for authentication and managing online reputations. The key sentences would be [S72]-[S76] for the purpose of 'cred', and [S78]-[S79] for the relation to Janrain's approach."

    "[S1] Janrain\n\n\n# Janrain\n\n\n\n**Janrain**, sometimes styled as **JanRain**, is a customer profile and identity management (CIAM) software provider based in Portland, Oregon, United States. [S2] It was established in 2002. [S3] Akamai acquired Janrain in January 2019. [S4] ## History\n\nJanrain was founded in Portland in 2002 by Larry Drebes, who as of 2016\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49 is the company's chief technology officer (CTO), and former chief executive officer (CEO). [S5] The firm's name \"references a wet January in Portland\", and has been described as a \"leading provider of customer profile and identity management\". [S6] According to *Forbes*, Drebes recognized the value of social media in 2004 and predicted the need for users to manage their online identities. [S7] He helped create the OpenID protocol, which has been called a \"decentralized authentication method for the new Web\". [S8] Janrain was a founding member of the OpenID Foundation and has advocated for OpenID. [S9] As a privately held company, Janrain has grown steadily since its inception. [S10] In December 2009, Janrain raised US$3.25 million from American venture capital firms DFJ Frontier, RPM Ventures, and Anthem Venture Partners. [S11] According to TechCrunch, the firms invested in Janrain's ability to \"effectively mass market and sell authentication systems to website publishers based on OpenID and other online identity technologies\". [S12] *The Oregonian* and VentureBeat have reported that Janrain had 60 employees by mid-2011. [S13] In August 2011, the company announced a $15.5 million funding round led by Emergence Capital Partners, which was used for hiring staff and marketing. [S14] Emergence founder Brian Jacobs joined Janrain's board of directors. [S15] That month, the company had funding totaling $18.7 million from the four venture capital firms, as well as from Timothy C. [S16] Draper, and Drebes. [S17] Janrain's sales \"more than doubled\" in 2012, and the company expected a quicker sales growth rate for 2013. [S18] Janrain had 170 employees by January 2013. [S19] That month, the firm received $33 million in new investment, marking one of the largest venture capital rounds for an Internet company in Oregon. [S20] Funding was led by Millennium Technology Value Partners, with additional participation by DFJ Frontier and RPM Ventures, existing investors Emergence Capital and Anthem Venture Partners, plus Epic Ventures, Salesforce.com, and Split Rock Partners. [S21] Including the 2013 investment, which was more than twice the amount of any venture investment in Oregon in 2012, Janrain had raised $52\u201353 million, and was noted as one of the \"best-funded young technology\" businesses in the state. [S22] The company reportedly planned to use the money to employ salespeople and engineers, enhance its technology, add new features to its software, and enter markets outside the U.S. [S23] In February 2013, the Austin, Texas-based company Umbel announced its partnership with Janrain to combine the former company's \"real-time audience insights\" technology with the latter's \"User Management Platform, providing actionable intelligence from rich social data, in real-time\". [S24] In December 2014, Janrain acquired the startup company Arktan for an undisclosed amount. [S25] Janrain began offering data services developed by both companies, which had worked together for \"several years\" before the acquisition. [S26] According to *Advertising Age*, Janrain had grown to 160 employees; Drebes said there would be no executive changes for Arktan's five employees. [S27] *Inc.* reported that Janrain earned $14.3 million in revenue in 2014, had a three-year growth rate of 294%, and employed 135 people\u201444 more than the previous year. [S28] In 2015, the firm expanded its international reach by building a new data center in China. [S29] In September 2015, *Portland Business Journal* said Janrain employed \"around 120, most of them in Portland\", and had raised $52.8 million to date from investors. [S30] In December 2015, the company secured an additional $27 million in their Series D funding, led by HighBar Partners.",
    "[S31] The company's headquarters are in the Dekum Building at 519 Southwest Third Avenue in downtown Portland. [S32] Janrain moved into the building in 2009, occupying the sixth floor, which it vacated and moved into three others in February 2013. [S33] According to *Portland Business Journal*, much of the office space's \"funky\" modern and Romanesque architecture existed previously, though some updates were made when the company relocated. [S34] The space has an open design with glass walls for offices, a game room, a spiral staircase connecting the two floors, and an atrium extending up to an eighth floor skylight. [S35] It also has quiet, private spaces for nursing mothers, telephone calls, or work rooms. [S36] Conference rooms on one floor are named after mountains in the Pacific Northwest, while those on another level are named for Portland's bridges. [S37] Janrain turned the basketball court on the building's fourth floor, left by the previous occupant Wieden+Kennedy, into a conference room and meeting space. [S38] Janrain is open to remote work, which the *Portland Business Journal* said is unique in Portland. [S39] The company has satellite offices in Frankfurt, London, and Paris. [S40] In April 2016, Jim Kaskade joined Janrain as the new CEO. [S41] He was hired in turn by Conversica in late-2019. [S42] ### Clients\n\nIn December 2009, TechCrunch reported that Janrain's technology was being used for the websites of EMI Music, Fox News, Kmart, Sears, and Universal Music Group. [S43] Dr Pepper Snapple Group began using Janrain's identity management services for its digital properties in 2011. [S44] Intel and MTV were also confirmed as clients in 2011. [S45] In January 2013, Avis, BBC, the British public-service television broadcaster Channel 4, Comedy Central, Financial Times Fox, Fox Networks, Mattel, NPR, the Pac-12 Conference, Philips, Samsung, and Whole Foods Market were confirmed as clients. [S46] Pfizer became a client by the end of 2014, and AMC was confirmed in September 2015. [S47] ## Technology\n\nRPX, a software as a service (SaaS) platform for on-site OpenID account acceptance, has been described as Janrain's \"flagship\" product. [S48] More than 170,000 websites were using the solution by December 2009. [S49] According to VentureBeat, \"Janrain Engage\" enables social sharing, \"Janrain Capture\" gathers and stores profile data, and allows the sharing of profiles across websites; and \"Janrain Federate\" enables single sign-on for websites. [S50] In 2012, the company launched a \"one-click sharing mechanism\" for Facebook, giving users greater control over their sharing behaviors. [S51] Janrain's services were used by more than 350,000 websites by January 2013. [S52] TechCrunch said data collected by the company's technology from user log-ins helped clients \"provide better on-site or in-app experiences for their users\", and that \"These experiences could include personalized offers or promotions based on user's social demographics data. [S53] Janrain User Management Platform (JUMP) provides a single, unified view of users across multiple online properties and social identities, and includes products for social login, profile data storage, registration, and single sign-on.\"\n\nJanrain's \"social login\" technology enables websites to offer registration with profiles from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media sites. [S54] It uses profile data, such as a user's age, gender, interests, and location, allowing marketers to target advertising messages. [S55] According to *The Oregonian*'s Mike Rogoway, Janrain \"encourages its clients to minimize what they ask online visitors to share, at least initially, and to build trust\". [S56] Janrain hired technology attorney Lewis Barr to serve as vice president for \"legal and privacy matters\", and to inform clients about the appropriate and legal collection of digital information.",
    "[S57] In June 2014, the company launched \"Janrain User-Generated Content\" (\"Janrain UGC\"); according to *Adweek*, the service \"allows brands to give their fans the ability to interact, comment on, and chat about content on their sites\u00a0... [S58] [and] allowing them to easily discover friends\u2019 activities on those sites\" and \"better create personalized brand experiences\". [S59] Features include comments, activity streams, live chat, social post curation, and redesigned social sharing. [S60] The firm's \"Social Profile Navigator\" provides users with an overview of the data they are sharing on social media sites. [S61] Arktan, which Janrain acquired in 2014, developed technology that analyzes Facebook data and enables comments, polls, reviews, and other services. [S62] Arktan had also developed social television technology and partnered with Facebook in India to generate on-air and online graphics using data from Facebook Keyword Insights API during the 2014 Indian Premier League cricket event. [S63] ### Jyte\n\n**Jyte** was a community-based website created by JanRain in late January 2007, named as an acronym for \"Just You Tell 'Em\". [S64] According to the developers, Jyte allowed users to \"make claims about [themselves], others, or just about anything\". [S65] These \"claims\" consisted of a headline and, optionally, a short text body. [S66] They could also be assigned user-selected tags. [S67] A claim was presented as a declarative sentence. [S68] Site users could then vote on it by selecting whether they agree or disagree. [S69] The total number of people who have voted, as well as their votes, were displayed with the claim. [S70] Users could also leave comments on claims, with or without voting. [S71] One article described Jyte as an example of the \"democracy of the internet,\" which \"can appear to give rise to some amazing insights.\"\n\nIn addition, users could give each other \"cred\". [S72] Cred consisted of a short word or phrase, such as a tag, that applied to a user. [S73] For example, if user Bob made a valid claim about darts, user Mary might assign him \"darts\" cred. [S74] Receiving cred increased the recipient user's \"cred score\". [S75] Cred was designed to give an idea of how trustworthy a user was in a given area, as well as his or her interests. [S76] Jyte was developed primarily with Ruby on Rails, and was interoperable with other sites by means of several APIs. [S77] It relied solely on OpenID for user authentication. [S78] The use of one's OpenID in multiple websites and environments and the creation of a non-anonymous, portable, weighted, and persistent online reputation could provide advantages to a user in future discussions in other online and off line contexts. [S79] Jyte was described as a source of arbitrary opinions. [S80] The website is since extinct. [S81] It was acquired by \"AboutUs\" in 2010, and sometime later wholly ceased to exist. [S82] ## Reception\n\n*Inc.* ranked Janrain number 264, number 455, number 723, and number 1,412 in its annual \"Inc. [S83] 5000 Rank\" for 2012 to 2015, respectively. [S84] The magazine's \"Inc. [S85] 5000 Honors\" for 2015 named Janrain a \"Five-Time Inc. [S86] 5000 Honoree\", number 109 for top companies in Portland, and number 19 for top companies in Oregon. [S87] In January 2014, Janrain was named a winner of the CRM Watchlist 2014, which was compiled by Paul Greenberg for his ZDNet blog, \"Social CRM: The Conversation\". [S88] Greenberg said Janrain's submission was the best-written of the year. [S89] Janrain was ranked number 73 and number 252 on Deloitte's \"Technology Fast 500\" in 2014 and 2015, respectively. [S90] Deloitte listed the company's growth rates as 1,741% (2014) and 291% (2015)."
