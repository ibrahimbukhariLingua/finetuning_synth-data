      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the grandson of the third baronet in connecting the Spearman family to the Brazilian imperial family and who his spouse was.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the Spearman baronets, their history, and some family relations. Let me go through each sentence carefully.\n\nLooking at sentence S4: It says that Sir Alexander Spearman, son of Commander Alexander Young Crawshay Mainwaring Spearman (1862\u20131915), who is the half-brother of the second Baronet, was a Conservative politician. Then it mentions his grandson Alexander Spearman (born 1984) married Brazilian Princess Amelia of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, daughter of Prince Ant\u00f4nio of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza, who are descendants of the former Brazilian imperial family.\n\nSo, the third baronet is Sir Alexander Young Spearman, 3rd Baronet (1881\u20131959). His grandson would be the son of his son. But according to S4, the grandson in question is Alexander Spearman (born 1984), who married into the Brazilian imperial family. The spouse is Princess Amelia of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza. \n\nThe role here is that the grandson (Alexander Spearman) connected the family through marriage. The spouse is Amelia, daughter of Prince Ant\u00f4nio. The citation for this information is S4. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in other sentences. S5 lists the baronets but doesn't mention the grandson. So the answer is based on S4. Therefore, the statement should cite S4."
