That sounds like efficiency. \n\n[S57] talks about experimenting with changes in healthcare chains related to work accidents to encourage returning to work when partially fit. This seems like an innovative approach. \n\n[S58] says they put the model into general use after successful experience, which supports that they implemented an effective solution. \n\n[S59] states they treated 50k work accidents annually, which might show scale but not directly innovation. \n\nOther sentences mention ownership changes, organizational structure, awards, etc., which might not be directly relevant. \n\nSo the key points are [S56], [S57], and [S58]. I need to make sure these are the citations. Let me check again. Yes, those sentences directly mention cost savings through remote doctors and experimenting with work accident models, which tie into innovation and efficiency.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] L\u00e4hiTapiola\n\n\n# L\u00e4hiTapiola\n\n\n\n**L\u00e4hiTapiola** (Swedish: *LokalTapiola*) is a Finnish finance group company providing insurance services, formed by the fusion of the L\u00e4hivakuutus and Tapiola companies. [S2] L\u00e4hiTapiola is a group company owned by its customers, serving private, farm, entrepreneur, corporate and community clients. [S3] The company's products and services include damage, life and retirement insurance as well as investment and savings services. [S4] Services for corporate clients include services related to risk management and staff wellbeing. [S5] In 2019 the company had a business result of 273.1 million euro. [S6] In 2020 the company had almost 1.6 million owner customers and it was the largest company in Finland to provide traffic insurance, the second largest to provide damage insurance and the fourth largest to provide life insurance. [S7] ## History\n\n\n### Corporate background\n\nThe roots of the L\u00e4hivakuutus and Tapiola companies go back to the 18th and 19th centuries. [S8] The history of L\u00e4hivakuutus starts from 1770, when king Adolf Frederick of Sweden enacted a law to found fire control groups in towns. [S9] The history of Tapiola starts from 1857 when the Paloapuyhti\u00f6 group was founded. [S10] Of the direct predecessor companies of Tapiola, Pohja was founded in 1909 and Aura in 1917. [S11] After the 1933 law about mutual insurance companies several local L\u00e4hivakuutus companies were founded all over Finland. [S12] ### Tapiola and L\u00e4hivakuutus (1928-2012)\n\nTapiola was founded on the nameday of Tapio on 18 June 1982 when the Aura and Pohja companies were merged. [S13] In 1983 L\u00e4hivakuutus was chosen as the common marketing name for the group of L\u00e4hivakuutus insurance companies, used both nationally and locally. [S14] In the 2000s Tapiola decided to expand its activity to financial services. [S15] The company first founded Tapiola Omaisuudenhoito Oy and Tapiola-rahastoyhti\u00f6 Oy, which later merged into Tapiola Varainhoito Oy. [S16] Tapiola Pankki Oy started operation in 2004. [S17] In 2011 the already existing plans for a fusion between L\u00e4hivakuutus and Tapiola were opened and the agreement of the fusion was signed on 23 December. [S18] In February 2012 Tapiola and L\u00e4hivakuutus announced their merger. [S19] The supervisory boards of the companies signed the foundation contract of L\u00e4hiTapiola and the fusion was accepted by the corporate meetings in May 2012. [S20] In June 2012 the new marketing name was announced as L\u00e4hiTapiola. [S21] ### L\u00e4hiTapiola's early years (2013-2014)\n\nThe L\u00e4hiTapiola group officially started operation in 2013. [S22] The first CEO of L\u00e4hiTapiola was Erkki Moisander. [S23] The fusion was one of the largest and arguably one of the most difficult in the economic history of Finland, as the corporate cultures of the two companies were different. [S24] The Tapiola group was a centralised, professionally led company, where the CEO at the time Asmo Kalpala had a great deal of power. [S25] The corporate culture was described as polite and including academic discussion.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S26] On the other hand, L\u00e4hivakuutus had distributed management, where the power lay in independent insurance companies in the Finnish regions, acting in an agile and professional manner. [S27] The company led by Moisander employed a direct way of speaking. [S28] Throughout the years, there had been multiple attempts to fuse the two companies and both of them had futilely tried to merge with Fennia. [S29] The companies feared the business would turn to be led by banks, as their competitor the OP Group provided bonuses to its bank clients, which could be used in insurance payments. [S30] The fusion brought a competitive advantage in the growing competition. [S31] The birth of L\u00e4hiTapiola was the responsibility of Kalpala, Moisander and the chairman of the board of L\u00e4hivakuutus, Ralf Wikstr\u00f6m. [S32] In the negotiations, L\u00e4hivakuutus had a good position, as it did not need the fusion as much as the Tapiola Bank which had lost part of its market share. [S33] Kalpala himself was motivated by a need to go through the fusion before retiring. [S34] The board of L\u00e4hivakuutus wanted to retain the independence of its regional communities in the fusion. [S35] In practice the fusion was equal, but it was met with much resistance to change. [S36] L\u00e4hiTapiola was one of the largest damage insurance providers in Finland and had a market share of 25.6%.\u00b9\u2075 L\u00e4hiTapiola was also the fourth largest provider of life insurance in Finland with a market share of 7.9%.\u00b9\u2079\n\nIn June the Tapiola Bank changed its name to the L\u00e4hiTapiola Bank. [S37] The Tapiola Bank and the S-Bank announced their fusion on 6 June 2013 as a part of a larger collaboration between the S Group and L\u00e4hiTapiola. [S38] The S Group owned 75% of the new bank and L\u00e4hiTapiola owned 25%. [S39] Moisander managed to form a common corporate culture by treating everyone equally and through interaction and discussions. [S40] The L\u00e4hiTapiola staff learned the leadership manner of L\u00e4hivakuutus based on the balance and the profit calculation, which brought profitability and cost awareness to the company. [S41] On the other hand, Tapiola brought a great deal of new business: life insurance, banking, re-insurance and internationalisation. [S42] A culture of appreciation and understanding was formed by realising the strengths of both parties. [S43] In 2014 L\u00e4hiTapiola started a new strategic initiative involving a diverse and conversing management. [S44] In early 2014 the L\u00e4hiTapiola Central Retirement Insurance Company fused with El\u00e4ke-Fennia. [S45] The new work insurance company was named Elo. [S46] In May 2014 the S-Bank and L\u00e4hiTapiola merged into a new S-Bank. [S47] ### L\u00e4hiTapiola (2015-)\n\nIn 2016 L\u00e4hiTapiola was the second largest damage insurance company with a revenue of 1.1 billion euro, of which the life insurance company had a share of 422 million euro. [S48] The company had 1.6 million owner customers. [S49] The total sum of client funds controlled by L\u00e4hiTapiola was 9.7 billion euro, and its associates included the S-Bank, Elo and Pihlajalinna. [S50] L\u00e4hiTapiola employed about 3400 people. [S51] In January 2017 L\u00e4hiTapiola announced it would renew its strategy by diminishing its role as an insurance company and making life support into its core function. [S52] Life support in this case means services for safety, finance and health, for example damage and life insurance, fund control and services related to health and wellbeing. [S53] In June L\u00e4hiTapiola and the healthcare company Mehil\u00e4inen announced they would start strategic cooperation.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that made the merger between L\u00e4hivakuutus and Tapiola difficult and how they addressed cultural differences.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, and I should scan each sentence for relevant information. \n\nStarting with the factors contributing to the difficulty. From the context, I remember that the merger was described as one of the largest and most difficult in Finland's economic history. The key point here is the different corporate cultures. Specifically, in sentence S24, it mentions that the corporate cultures of the two companies were different. Then, looking at S25, it details that Tapiola was centralized with a powerful CEO, while L\u00e4hivakuutus had distributed management with regional independence. That's a clear factor. Also, S26 explains that L\u00e4hivakuutus had a distributed management structure, which contrasts with Tapiola's centralized approach. Additionally, S28 mentions previous failed attempts to merge with Fennia, which might indicate existing challenges in merging companies. Also, S29 talks about fears of being led by banks due to OP Group's strategies, which could have added complexity.\n\nNow, for how they addressed cultural differences. The context mentions that Moisander worked on forming a common culture by treating everyone equally and through interaction (S40). Also, S41 says they adopted L\u00e4hivakuutus's leadership style focusing on balance and profit, which brought profitability. On the other hand, Tapiola contributed new areas like life insurance and banking (S42). S43 mentions a culture of appreciation by recognizing both parties' strengths. Additionally, S44 talks about a new strategic initiative with diverse management, which might have helped in integrating different cultures.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. For example, the cultural differences are covered in S24, S25, S26. The addressing of differences is in S40, S41, S42, S43. Also, check if other sentences have relevant info. For instance, S35 mentions retaining regional communities' independence, which might relate to managing cultural differences. But maybe that's more about the structure than addressing cultural issues. \n\nWait, the user is asking how they addressed the cultural differences during integration. So the answer should focus on the methods used. The key points are Moisander's approach (S40), adopting L\u00e4hivakuutus's leadership (S41), Tapiola's contributions (S42), and the culture of appreciation (S43). Also, the strategic initiatives (S44) might be part of that. \n\nI need to structure the answer into two parts: factors and solutions. Each part with the relevant citations. Make sure each sentence in the answer is in <statement> tags with correct citations. Also, check that all citations are from the provided passage. Avoid adding any external knowledge. Let me verify each citation again to ensure accuracy."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the changes in ownership and healthcare initiatives that L\u00e4hiTapiola implemented between 2018 and 2020, and how these actions reflect its strategic priorities.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me scan through each one to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with ownership changes. Sentence [S54] mentions that in May 2018, L\u00e4hiTapiola raised its ownership share of Mehil\u00e4inen from 9% to 20%. That's a clear ownership change. Then, in [S61], it says that in August 2020, they announced raising their ownership share of Seligson & Co from 40% to 100%. So those are two key ownership changes during the period.\n\nNext, healthcare initiatives. Looking at the sentences, [S55] talks about the first results from healthcare chains by Mehil\u00e4inen in October 2018. Then [S56] mentions using remote doctors in healthcare chains with cost savings. [S57] and [S58] discuss experimenting with changes in healthcare chains related to work accidents to encourage returning to work when partially fit, which became general use after success. [S59] states they treated about 50k work accidents annually. \n\nNow, how do these reflect strategic priorities? The ownership increases in Mehil\u00e4inen and Seligson & Co might indicate a strategy to strengthen control over healthcare and investment sectors. The healthcare initiatives like remote doctors and work accident programs could be about cost efficiency and improving service effectiveness, aligning with their focus on healthcare services and customer care. The leadership change in [S60] with Juha Koponen starting in 2020 might relate to strategic direction, but the question is about ownership and healthcare, so maybe not directly relevant here.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each relevant sentence and their citations. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check if all the points are covered and cited correctly. Also, ensure that the answer doesn't include any extra information not in the context. Let me verify each citation again to make sure they are correctly linked to the statements."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how L\u00e4hiTapiola's organizational structure and regional presence evolved by 2021 and what that indicates about its operational scope. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage has several sections, including \"Organisation,\" \"L\u00e4hiTapiola regional companies,\" \"Ownership,\" etc. \n\nStarting with the organizational structure. In the \"Organisation\" section, there's a mention that the group consists of damage and life insurance companies, investment companies, and 20 regional companies. Then, in 2020, they had 1.6 million customers, 3400 employees, and over 200 offices. But the key part is under \"L\u00e4hiTapiola regional companies\" where it lists the regions as of autumn 2021. There are 19 regions listed, including areas like Southern Finland, Lapland, etc. Also, note that in Western Finland, there was a merger of two regional companies in 2021. \n\nSo, the organizational structure by 2021 includes 20 regional companies, but the exact number might have changed due to the merger. The passage says \"the L\u00e4hiTapiola group had regional companies in...\" and lists 19 regions, but the original mention was 20 regional companies. However, the merger in Western Finland might have reduced the count. Wait, the text says \"In autumn 2021 the L\u00e4hiTapiola group had regional companies in...\" followed by 19 regions. But the earlier sentence says \"as well as 20 regional companies.\" Maybe the merger in 2021 adjusted that number. So, perhaps they had 20 regional companies, but after the merger in Western Finland, it's now 19? Or maybe the list includes the merged one. The exact number might be tricky, but the key point is that they have a extensive regional presence across Finland.\n\nRegarding the operational scope, the expansion into multiple regions and the merger suggest a focus on regional coverage, which indicates a broad operational scope. Also, the fact that they have various subsidiaries in different sectors (insurance, investments, housing) shows diversification. The ownership changes, like increasing stake in Seligson & Co and Mehil\u00e4inen, might indicate strategic investments to expand their services.\n\nNow, checking the citations. The regional companies list is in [S68] and the merger in Western Finland is mentioned in [S68]. The organizational structure details are in [S63]-[S67]. The 20 regional companies are mentioned in [S64]. The merger in Western Finland is in [S68]. \n\nSo, the answer should mention the 20 regional companies (cited from [S64]), the merger in Western Finland (cited [S68]), and the regional presence across 19 areas (cited [S68]). The operational scope indicates a broad regional coverage and diversified services, which can be linked to the organizational structure and subsidiaries mentioned in [S63]-[S67]."

[S7] ## History\n\n\n### Corporate background\n\nThe roots of the L\u00e4hivakuutus and Tapiola companies go back to the 18th and 19th centuries. [S8] The history of L\u00e4hivakuutus starts from 1770, when king Adolf Frederick of Sweden enacted a law to found fire control groups in towns. [S9] The history of Tapiola starts from 1857 when the Paloapuyhti\u00f6 group was founded. [S10] Of the direct predecessor companies of Tapiola, Pohja was founded in 1909 and Aura in 1917. [S11] After the 1933 law about mutual insurance companies several local L\u00e4hivakuutus companies were founded all over Finland. [S12] ### Tapiola and L\u00e4hivakuutus (1928-2012)\n\nTapiola was founded on the nameday of Tapio on 18 June 1982 when the Aura and Pohja companies were merged. [S13] In 1983 L\u00e4hivakuutus was chosen as the common marketing name for the group of L\u00e4hivakuutus insurance companies, used both nationally and locally. [S14] In the 2000s Tapiola decided to expand its activity to financial services. [S15] The company first founded Tapiola Omaisuudenhoito Oy and Tapiola-rahastoyhti\u00f6 Oy, which later merged into Tapiola Varainhoito Oy. [S16] Tapiola Pankki Oy started operation in 2004. [S17] In 2011 the already existing plans for a fusion between L\u00e4hivakuutus and Tapiola were opened and the agreement of the fusion was signed on 23 December. [S18] In February 2012 Tapiola and L\u00e4hivakuutus announced their merger. [S19] The supervisory boards of the companies signed the foundation contract of L\u00e4hiTapiola and the fusion was accepted by the corporate meetings in May 2012. [S20] In June 2012 the new marketing name was announced as L\u00e4hiTapiola. [S21] ### L\u00e4hiTapiola's early years (2013-2014)\n\nThe L\u00e4hiTapiola group officially started operation in 2013. [S22] The first CEO of L\u00e4hiTapiola was Erkki Moisander. [S23] The fusion was one of the largest and arguably one of the most difficult in the economic history of Finland, as the corporate cultures of the two companies were different. [S24] The Tapiola group was a centralised, professionally led company, where the CEO at the time Asmo Kalpala had a great deal of power. [S25] The corporate culture was described as polite and including academic discussion.",
    "[S26] On the other hand, L\u00e4hivakuutus had distributed management, where the power lay in independent insurance companies in the Finnish regions, acting in an agile and professional manner. [S27] The company led by Moisander employed a direct way of speaking. [S28] Throughout the years, there had been multiple attempts to fuse the two companies and both of them had futilely tried to merge with Fennia. [S29] The companies feared the business would turn to be led by banks, as their competitor the OP Group provided bonuses to its bank clients, which could be used in insurance payments. [S30] The fusion brought a competitive advantage in the growing competition. [S31] The birth of L\u00e4hiTapiola was the responsibility of Kalpala, Moisander and the chairman of the board of L\u00e4hivakuutus, Ralf Wikstr\u00f6m. [S32] In the negotiations, L\u00e4hivakuutus had a good position, as it did not need the fusion as much as the Tapiola Bank which had lost part of its market share. [S33] Kalpala himself was motivated by a need to go through the fusion before retiring. [S34] The board of L\u00e4hivakuutus wanted to retain the independence of its regional communities in the fusion. [S35] In practice the fusion was equal, but it was met with much resistance to change. [S36] L\u00e4hiTapiola was one of the largest damage insurance providers in Finland and had a market share of 25.6%.\u00b9\u2075 L\u00e4hiTapiola was also the fourth largest provider of life insurance in Finland with a market share of 7.9%.\u00b9\u2079\n\nIn June the Tapiola Bank changed its name to the L\u00e4hiTapiola Bank. [S37] The Tapiola Bank and the S-Bank announced their fusion on 6 June 2013 as a part of a larger collaboration between the S Group and L\u00e4hiTapiola. [S38] The S Group owned 75% of the new bank and L\u00e4hiTapiola owned 25%. [S39] Moisander managed to form a common corporate culture by treating everyone equally and through interaction and discussions. [S40] The L\u00e4hiTapiola staff learned the leadership manner of L\u00e4hivakuutus based on the balance and the profit calculation, which brought profitability and cost awareness to the company. [S41] On the other hand, Tapiola brought a great deal of new business: life insurance, banking, re-insurance and internationalisation. [S42] A culture of appreciation and understanding was formed by realising the strengths of both parties. [S43] In 2014 L\u00e4hiTapiola started a new strategic initiative involving a diverse and conversing management. [S44] In early 2014 the L\u00e4hiTapiola Central Retirement Insurance Company fused with El\u00e4ke-Fennia. [S45] The new work insurance company was named Elo. [S46] In May 2014 the S-Bank and L\u00e4hiTapiola merged into a new S-Bank. [S47] ### L\u00e4hiTapiola (2015-)\n\nIn 2016 L\u00e4hiTapiola was the second largest damage insurance company with a revenue of 1.1 billion euro, of which the life insurance company had a share of 422 million euro. [S48] The company had 1.6 million owner customers. [S49] The total sum of client funds controlled by L\u00e4hiTapiola was 9.7 billion euro, and its associates included the S-Bank, Elo and Pihlajalinna. [S50] L\u00e4hiTapiola employed about 3400 people. [S51] In January 2017 L\u00e4hiTapiola announced it would renew its strategy by diminishing its role as an insurance company and making life support into its core function. [S52] Life support in this case means services for safety, finance and health, for example damage and life insurance, fund control and services related to health and wellbeing. [S53] In June L\u00e4hiTapiola and the healthcare company Mehil\u00e4inen announced they would start strategic cooperation.",
    "[S54] In May 2018 L\u00e4hiTapiola raised its ownership share of Mehil\u00e4inen from 9% to 20%. [S55] In October the company announced its first results from healthcare chains by the healthcare service provided by Mehil\u00e4inen. [S56] Use of remote doctors in healthcare chains of less than 500 euro provided a saving of 56 percent in costs. [S57] The company also announced it would experiment with a change in healthcare chains relating to work accidents which would encourage people to return to work when they were partially fit. [S58] After successful experience the company decided to put this model into general use. [S59] The company treated about 50 thousand work accidents per year. [S60] After Moisander retired in late 2019 Juha Koponen was chosen as his successor, and he started as the company's directory in 2020. [S61] In August 2020 L\u00e4hiTapiola announced it would raise its ownership share of the investment fund company Seligson & Co from 40% to 100%.
