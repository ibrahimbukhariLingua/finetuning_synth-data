      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Lendico's expansion strategy reflected its relationship with Rocket Internet and which countries it entered initially.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan the passage again. \n\nStarting with the first sentence, it mentions that Lendico was founded in December 2013 by Rocket Internet. That's S3. Then, in S4, it says after launching in Germany, they expanded into Spain, Poland, Austria, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Brazil. But the question is about the initial phase. Also, S10 mentions that during the first 20 months, they established themselves in Austria, Brazil, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and South Africa, replicating the expansion plan used by Rocket Internet. \n\nSo the expansion strategy of entering those countries was similar to what Rocket Internet usually does. The initial countries would be those listed in S4 and S10. But need to check if there's a difference between the initial launch and the first 20 months. The passage says after launching in Germany, they expanded into those countries. So Germany was the starting point, then others. But the question is about the initial phase. The initial phase might refer to the first countries after Germany. However, S10 says during the first 20 months, they established in those countries. So the initial expansion countries would be Austria, Brazil, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, South Africa. Also, S4 lists Spain, Poland, Austria, South Africa, Netherlands, Brazil. So those are the countries. \n\nThe relationship with Rocket Internet is that their expansion plan replicated the one used by Rocket Internet, as stated in S10. So the answer would connect the expansion strategy to Rocket Internet's usual approach. \n\nNow, need to structure the answer with citations. The first part about the relationship is in S10. The countries are mentioned in S4 and S10. But S4 says after launching in Germany, expanded into those countries. So the initial phase would include Germany and the others? Wait, the question says \"initial phase\". The passage says \"after launching in Germany, the company expanded into...\" so Germany was the first, then others. But the exact initial phase might be the first countries. However, the user might consider the initial phase as the first few countries. But the answer should be based on the text. \n\nThe question is asking which countries did it enter during its initial phase. The passage says in S4: after launching in Germany, expanded into Spain, Poland, Austria, South Africa, Netherlands, and Brazil. So those are the countries entered during the initial phase. But S10 mentions the first 20 months, establishing in Austria, Brazil, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and South Africa. So maybe the initial phase is those countries, excluding Germany? Or including Germany? The question might consider the initial phase as the first countries after the launch. But the exact answer depends on the text. \n\nThe answer should state that the expansion strategy reflected Rocket Internet's usual plan (S10), and the countries were Spain, Poland, Austria, South Africa, Netherlands, Brazil (S4 and S10). However, S4 mentions Germany as the launch country, so maybe the initial phase includes Germany. But the question might be referring to the expansion beyond Germany. The user's question is a bit ambiguous, but based on the text, the initial phase would include Germany and the others. However, the passage says \"after launching in Germany, the company expanded into...\" which implies that Germany was the starting point, and the expansion into other countries was the next step. So the initial phase might refer to the countries entered after Germany. But the exact answer needs to be based on the text. \n\nIn the passage, S10 says during the first 20 months, they established in those countries. So the initial phase is those countries. But the exact list is in S4 and S10. So the answer would list those countries. \n\nSo the final answer would be: Lendico's expansion strategy replicated Rocket Internet's usual approach (S10), entering Spain, Poland, Austria, South Africa, Netherlands, and Brazil during its initial phase (S4 and S10). But need to check if the citations are correctly assigned. \n\nWait, S4 says after launching in Germany, expanded into Spain, Poland, Austria, South Africa, Netherlands, and Brazil. So the initial phase includes those countries. S10 mentions the same countries. So the citations would be [S4][S10] for the countries. And [S10] for the relationship with Rocket Internet."

That covers how they assess creditworthiness. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might add more info. S14 talks about the loan period, but that's about repayment terms, not interest rates. S12 and S13 seem to be the key ones. \n\nSo the answer should list the factors from S12 and explain the credit assessment process from S13. Citations would be [S12] and [S13].

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key features of Lendico's loan offerings and the percentage of applications typically accepted on the platform.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passage again to find relevant sentences. \n\nStarting with the key features of the loans. Looking at the sections, under \"Business Model,\" there's a sentence that says: \"The loans are personal loans or SME loans and range between \u20ac1,000 - \u20ac150,000 in Germany.\" That's S12. So that's a key feature. Then, the interest fee calculation is mentioned in S13: \"The interest fee is calculated on the basis of the borrower\u2019s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower\u2019s debt-to-income ratio.\" Also, S14 mentions that Lendico determines creditworthiness and assigns a credit grade affecting the interest rate and fees. The loan period is between 1-5 years and can be repaid anytime (S15). Also, S16 says only 10% of applications are received on the platform. Wait, but the question is about the percentage accepted. Wait, S15 says \"Only 10% of applications are received on the platform.\" Wait, does that mean 10% are accepted or that 10% are received? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the question is about the percentage typically accepted. So maybe that's the answer. But I need to check if there's another sentence. Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the passage again. S15: \"Only 10% of applications are received on the platform.\" Wait, maybe that's a translation error. Maybe it's supposed to say \"approved\" or \"accepted.\" But as per the given text, it's \"received.\" However, the user is asking for accepted applications. If the passage says \"received,\" but maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"received\" here refers to the number of applications processed. But the user's question is about acceptance rate. If the passage states that 10% are received, but maybe that's not the acceptance rate. However, given the information provided, S15 is the only mention of a percentage related to applications. So perhaps that's the answer, even if the wording is a bit off. \n\nSo the key features would be: personal and SME loans, amounts between \u20ac1k-\u20ac150k, interest based on credit score, credit history, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio; credit grading; loan terms 1-5 years, repayable anytime. And the percentage accepted is 10%, as per S15. \n\nBut I need to make sure there are no other sentences. Let me check again. The passage mentions \"Only 10% of applications are received on the platform.\" So maybe \"received\" here is meant to indicate the acceptance rate. Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error and should be \"approved.\" But as per the given text, that's the only percentage mentioned. So I'll go with that. \n\nSo the answer would list the key features from S12, S13, S14, S15, and the percentage from S15. Wait, but S15 is about the loan period. Let me check again. \n\nWait, S15 says: \"The loan period can range between 1 and 5 years and be repaid at any time.\" So that's the loan period. Then S16: \"Only 10% of applications are received on the platform.\" So that's the percentage. \n\nSo the key features are the types of loans (personal and SME), amounts (\u20ac1k-\u20ac150k), interest calculation factors (credit score, history, etc.), credit grading, loan terms (1-5 years, repayable anytime). The acceptance rate is 10% as per S16. \n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with each statement and citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the relevant citations. So:\n\nFirst statement: Lendico offers personal loans and SME loans ranging from \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac150,000 in Germany. [S12]\n\nSecond statement: The interest fee is determined by the borrower's credit score, credit history, loan amount, and debt-to-income ratio. [S13]\n\nThird statement: Lendico assesses creditworthiness and assigns a credit grade that affects the interest rate and fees. [S14]\n\nFourth statement: Loan terms range from 1 to 5 years and can be repaid at any time. [S15]\n\nFifth statement: Only 10% of applications are received on the platform. [S16]\n\nWait, but the question is about the percentage of applications typically accepted. If the passage says \"received,\" maybe that's not the same as accepted. But since there's no other percentage mentioned, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the passage. But as per the given info, S16 is the only one. So I'll proceed with that."
