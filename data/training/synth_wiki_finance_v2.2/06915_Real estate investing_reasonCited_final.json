      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which national and international real estate appraisal associations are mentioned in the source and what role they play in standardizing property valuation.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided passage and look for any mentions of real estate appraisal associations. The passage is labeled with sentence numbers in brackets, so I'll check each one.\n\nLooking at the passage, under the \"Valuation\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"Numerous national and international real estate appraisal associations exist to standardize property valuation.\" That's sentence [S21]. Then the next sentence lists some examples: \"Some of the larger of these include the Appraisal Institute, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the International Valuation Standards Council.\" That's [S22]. \n\nSo the associations mentioned are the Appraisal Institute, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and the International Valuation Standards Council. The role they play is standardizing property valuation, as stated in [S21]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other associations mentioned elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the passage, I don't see any other names. The answer should list these three organizations and their role. The citations would be [S21] for the role and [S22] for the list of associations. \n\nWait, the question asks for both the names and their role. So the sentence that mentions the role is [S21], and the specific associations are in [S22]. So the answer should have two statements: one citing [S21] and another citing [S22]. But the user's example shows that each sentence is in its own <statement> tag. So I need to structure it accordingly.\n\nSo the first statement would be about the role, citing [S21], and the second statement lists the associations, citing [S22]. Alternatively, maybe combine them into one statement if possible. But according to the example, each sentence is a separate statement. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example has two sentences: the first is a sample without citations, the second has two citations. So each sentence is a separate statement. Therefore, I need to split into two statements. However, the information about the role and the list of associations are in two different sentences. So:\n\nFirst statement: \"Numerous national and international real estate appraisal associations exist to standardize property valuation.\" Cited as [S21].\n\nSecond statement: \"Some of the larger of these include the Appraisal Institute, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the International Valuation Standards Council.\" Cited as [S22].\n\nThat should cover both parts of the question. The user might want the answer to explicitly state the role, so the first sentence explains the role, and the second lists the associations. That makes sense. I think that's all. No other citations are needed here."

      "question": "What regulatory changes enabled real estate crowdfunding, and how does this method address equity requirements for smaller investors?",
      "answer": "<statement>The regulatory changes that enabled real estate crowdfunding include the easing of investment solicitations under the JOBS Act in April 2012, which allowed pooling of equity from both accredited and non-accredited investors through special purpose vehicles. This method addresses equity requirements for smaller investors by enabling them to contribute smaller amounts of capital collectively, reducing individual equity burdens while still participating in real estate investments.<cite>[S40]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S46] Tax shelter offsets occur in one of three ways: depreciation (which may sometimes be accelerated), tax credits, and carryover losses which reduce tax liability charged against income from other sources for a period of 27.5 years. [S47] Some tax shelter benefits can be transferable, depending on the laws governing tax liability in the jurisdiction where the property is located. [S48] These can be sold to others for a cash return or other benefits. [S49] Equity build-up is the increase in the investor's equity ratio as the portion of debt service payments devoted to principal accrue over time. [S50] Equity build-up counts as positive cash flow from the asset where the debt service payment is made out of income from the property, rather than from independent income sources. [S51] Capital appreciation is the increase in the market value of the asset over time, realized as a cash flow when the property is sold. [S52] Capital appreciation can be very unpredictable unless it is part of a development and improvement strategy. [S53] The purchase of a property for which the majority of the projected cash flows are expected from capital appreciation (prices going up) rather than other sources is considered speculation rather than investment. [S54] Research results that found that real estate firms are more likely to take a smaller stake in larger assets when investing abroad (Mauck & Price, 2017). [S55] ## Foreclosure investment\n\nSome individuals and companies focus their investment strategy on purchasing properties that are in some stage of foreclosure. [S56] A property is considered in pre-foreclosure when the homeowner has defaulted on their mortgage loan. [S57] Formal foreclosure processes vary by state and may be judicial or non-judicial, which affects the length of time the property is in the pre-foreclosure phase. [S58] Once the formal foreclosure processes are underway, these properties can be purchased at a public sale, usually called a foreclosure auction or sheriff's sale. [S59] If the property does not sell at the public auction, then ownership of the property is returned to the lender. [S60] Properties at this phase are called Real Estate Owned, or REOs. [S61] Once a property is sold at the foreclosure auction or as an REO, the lender may keep the proceeds to satisfy their mortgage and any legal costs that they incurred minus the costs of the sale and any outstanding tax obligations. [S62] The foreclosing bank or lending institution has the right to continue to honor tenant leases (if there are tenants in the property) during the REO phase but usually, the bank wants the property vacant to sell it more easily. [S63] ### Buy, rehab, rent and refinance\n\nBuy, rehab, rent, refinance (BRRR) is a real estate investment strategy, used by real estate investors who have experience renovating or rehabbing properties to \"flip\" houses. [S64] BRRR is different from \"flipping\" houses. [S65] Flipping houses implies buying a property and quickly selling it for a profit, with or without repairs. [S66] BRRR is a long-term investment strategy that involves renting out a property and letting it appreciate in value before selling it. [S67] Renting out a BRRR property provides a stable passive income source that is used to cover mortgage payments while home price appreciation increases future capital gains. [S68] The phrase was slightly updated in a 2022 Bloomberg News article noting that BiggerPockets added \"Repeat\" to the end, making it \"BRRRR\" to describe a real estate investing strategy of Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. [S69] ## Impact\n\nAccording to Lima et al. [S70] (2022), in Ireland, the financialization of rental housing, which includes the entry of institutional investors into urban rental housing markets, contributed to structural factors that create homelessness directly by worsening affordability and security in the private rental market, and indirectly by influencing state policy. [S71] It was found that the history, politics, and geography of the REITs cause the collapse of Irelands market (Waldron, 2018).\n\nPassage 2:\n[S25] Real estate assets are typically expensive, and investors will generally not pay the entire amount of the purchase price of a property in cash. [S26] Usually, a large portion of the purchase price will be financed using some sort of financial instrument or debt, such as a mortgage loan collateralized by the property itself. [S27] The amount of the purchase price financed by debt is referred to as leverage. [S28] The amount financed by the investor's own capital, through cash or other asset transfers, is referred to as equity. [S29] The ratio of leverage to total appraised value (often referred to as \"LTV\", or loan to value for a conventional mortgage) is one mathematical measure of the risk an investor is taking by using leverage to finance the purchase of a property. [S30] Investors usually seek to decrease their equity requirements and increase their leverage, so that their return on investment is maximized. [S31] Lenders and other financial institutions usually have minimum equity requirements for real estate investments they are being asked to finance, typically on the order of 20% of appraised value. [S32] Investors seeking low equity requirements may explore alternate financing arrangements as part of the purchase of a property (for instance, seller financing, seller subordination, private equity sources, etc.)\n\nIf the property requires substantial repair, traditional lenders like banks will often not lend on a property and the investor may be required to borrow from a private lender using a short-term bridge loan like a hard money loan. [S33] Hard money loans are usually short-term loans where the lender charges a much higher interest rate because of the higher-risk nature of the loan. [S34] Hard money loans are typically at a much lower loan-to-value ratio than conventional mortgages. [S35] Some real estate investment organizations, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and some pension funds and hedge funds, have large enough capital reserves and investment strategies to allow 100% equity in the properties that they purchase. [S36] This minimizes the risk which comes from leverage but also limits potential return on investment. [S37] By leveraging the purchase of an investment property, the required periodic payments to service the debt create an ongoing (and sometimes large) negative cash flow beginning from the time of purchase. [S38] This is sometimes referred to as the carry cost or \"carry\" of the investment. [S39] To be successful, real estate investors must manage their cash flows to create enough positive income from the property to at least offset the carry costs.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn the United States, with the signing of the JOBS Act in April 2012 by President Obama, there was an easing on investment solicitations. [S40] A newer method of raising equity in smaller amounts is through real estate crowdfunding which can pool accredited and non-accredited investors together in a special purpose vehicle for all or part of the equity capital needed for the acquisition. [S41] Fundrise was the first company to crowdfund a real estate investment in the United States. [S42] ### Sources of investment returns\n\nReal estate properties may generate revenue through a number of means, including net operating income, tax shelter offsets, equity build-up, and capital appreciation. [S43] Net operating income is the sum of all profits from rents and other sources of ordinary income generated by a property, minus the sum of ongoing expenses, such as maintenance, utilities, fees, taxes, and other expenses. [S44] Rent is one of the main sources of revenue in commercial real estate investment. [S45] Tenants pay an agreed upon sum to landlords in exchange for the use of real property, and may also pay a portion of upkeep or operating expenses on the property.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the regulatory changes that enabled real estate crowdfunding and how this method addresses equity requirements for smaller investors.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find mentions of regulatory changes related to real estate crowdfunding. In Passage 2, there's a sentence that mentions the JOBS Act in April 2012. The JOBS Act, or Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, is a real regulatory change that eased investment solicitations. The specific sentence is [S40], which states that the JOBS Act led to an easing on investment solicitations, allowing real estate crowdfunding. That's the key regulatory change here.\n\nNext, the second part of the question is how real estate crowdfunding addresses equity requirements for smaller investors. Looking at the same passage, [S40] mentions that real estate crowdfunding can pool accredited and non-accredited investors into a special purpose vehicle for equity capital. This suggests that by pooling resources, smaller investors can contribute smaller amounts, thus lowering their individual equity requirements. Additionally, in Passage 2, [S31] talks about lenders having minimum equity requirements, typically 20%, but crowdfunding allows investors to pool funds, which might help meet these requirements without each investor needing to provide a large equity stake. However, the direct link is in [S40], explaining that crowdfunding enables raising equity in smaller amounts.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other citations. The JOBS Act is cited as [S40], and the part about pooling investors is also in [S40]. There's also [S41] mentioning Fundrise as the first company, but that's more about the example rather than the regulatory change. The equity part is covered in [S40]. So the answer should cite [S40] for both parts of the question."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking why the source emphasizes specialized knowledge for investing in foreign real estate and how this requirement has evolved over time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The key sentences here are probably S6 and S7. S6 says that investing in foreign countries requires specialized knowledge. S7 mentions that as international investment became more common in the 21st century, information availability increased. \n\nWait, the question also asks how the requirement has evolved. So, initially, maybe there was less information, but as it became more common, more information became available. But the source doesn't explicitly mention evolution beyond S7. The passage talks about the 1980s shift leading to global asset class, then early 21st century when information increased. So the need for specialized knowledge was there in the 80s, and then as investment grew, information improved. But the emphasis on specialized knowledge might be because of the complexity of foreign markets. \n\nAlso, looking at other sentences, like S13 and S14, which talk about real estate being unique and location-dependent, which might contribute to why specialized knowledge is needed. But the passage specifically mentions S6 and S7. The answer should cite those. \n\nSo the answer would be that the source emphasizes specialized knowledge because foreign real estate requires understanding local markets (S6), and this requirement has evolved as information became more available with increased international investment (S7). \n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with correct citations. Let me structure the answer accordingly."

    "[S1] Real estate investing\n\n\n# Real estate investing\n\n\n\n**Real estate investing** involves the purchase, management and sale or rental of real estate for profit. [S2] Someone who actively or passively invests in real estate is called a **real estate entrepreneur** or a **real estate investor**. [S3] In contrast, real estate development is building, improving or renovating real estate. [S4] ## History\n\nDuring the 1980s, real estate investment funds became increasingly involved in international real estate development. [S5] This shift led to real estate becoming a global asset class. [S6] Investing in real estate in foreign countries often requires specialized knowledge of the real estate market in that country. [S7] As international real estate investment became increasingly common in the early 21st century, the availability and quality of information regarding international real estate markets increased. [S8] Real estate is one of the primary areas of investment in China, where an estimated 70% of household wealth is invested in real estate. [S9] ## Overview\n\n\n### Types of real estate investments\n\nReal estate investing can be divided according to level of financial risk into core, value-added, and opportunistic. [S10] Real estate is divided into several broad categories, including residential property, commercial property and industrial property. [S11] ### Valuation\n\nReal estate markets in most countries are not as organized or efficient as markets for other, more liquid investment instruments. [S12] Individual properties are unique to themselves and not directly interchangeable, which makes evaluating investments less certain. [S13] Unlike other investments, real estate is fixed in a specific location and derives much of its value from that location. [S14] With residential real estate, the perceived safety of a neighbourhood and the number of services or amenities nearby can increase the value of a property. [S15] For this reason, the economic and social situation in an area is often a major factor in determining the value of its real estate. [S16] Property valuation is often the preliminary step taken during a real estate investment. [S17] Information asymmetry is commonplace in real estate markets, where one party may have more accurate information regarding the actual value of the property. [S18] Real estate investors typically use a variety of real estate appraisal techniques to determine the value of properties before purchase. [S19] This typically includes gathering documents and information about the property, inspecting the physical property, and comparing it to the market value of similar properties. [S20] A common method of valuing real estate is by dividing its net operating income by its capitalization rate, or CAP rate. [S21] Numerous national and international real estate appraisal associations exist to standardize property valuation. [S22] Some of the larger of these include the Appraisal Institute, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the International Valuation Standards Council. [S23] Investment properties are often purchased from a variety of sources, including market listings, real estate agents or brokers, banks, government entities such as Fannie Mae, public auctions, sales by owners, and real estate investment trusts. [S24] ### Financing",
    "[S25] Real estate assets are typically expensive, and investors will generally not pay the entire amount of the purchase price of a property in cash. [S26] Usually, a large portion of the purchase price will be financed using some sort of financial instrument or debt, such as a mortgage loan collateralized by the property itself. [S27] The amount of the purchase price financed by debt is referred to as leverage. [S28] The amount financed by the investor's own capital, through cash or other asset transfers, is referred to as equity. [S29] The ratio of leverage to total appraised value (often referred to as \"LTV\", or loan to value for a conventional mortgage) is one mathematical measure of the risk an investor is taking by using leverage to finance the purchase of a property. [S30] Investors usually seek to decrease their equity requirements and increase their leverage, so that their return on investment is maximized. [S31] Lenders and other financial institutions usually have minimum equity requirements for real estate investments they are being asked to finance, typically on the order of 20% of appraised value. [S32] Investors seeking low equity requirements may explore alternate financing arrangements as part of the purchase of a property (for instance, seller financing, seller subordination, private equity sources, etc.)\n\nIf the property requires substantial repair, traditional lenders like banks will often not lend on a property and the investor may be required to borrow from a private lender using a short-term bridge loan like a hard money loan. [S33] Hard money loans are usually short-term loans where the lender charges a much higher interest rate because of the higher-risk nature of the loan. [S34] Hard money loans are typically at a much lower loan-to-value ratio than conventional mortgages. [S35] Some real estate investment organizations, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and some pension funds and hedge funds, have large enough capital reserves and investment strategies to allow 100% equity in the properties that they purchase. [S36] This minimizes the risk which comes from leverage but also limits potential return on investment. [S37] By leveraging the purchase of an investment property, the required periodic payments to service the debt create an ongoing (and sometimes large) negative cash flow beginning from the time of purchase. [S38] This is sometimes referred to as the carry cost or \"carry\" of the investment. [S39] To be successful, real estate investors must manage their cash flows to create enough positive income from the property to at least offset the carry costs.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nIn the United States, with the signing of the JOBS Act in April 2012 by President Obama, there was an easing on investment solicitations. [S40] A newer method of raising equity in smaller amounts is through real estate crowdfunding which can pool accredited and non-accredited investors together in a special purpose vehicle for all or part of the equity capital needed for the acquisition. [S41] Fundrise was the first company to crowdfund a real estate investment in the United States. [S42] ### Sources of investment returns\n\nReal estate properties may generate revenue through a number of means, including net operating income, tax shelter offsets, equity build-up, and capital appreciation. [S43] Net operating income is the sum of all profits from rents and other sources of ordinary income generated by a property, minus the sum of ongoing expenses, such as maintenance, utilities, fees, taxes, and other expenses. [S44] Rent is one of the main sources of revenue in commercial real estate investment. [S45] Tenants pay an agreed upon sum to landlords in exchange for the use of real property, and may also pay a portion of upkeep or operating expenses on the property.",
    "[S46] Tax shelter offsets occur in one of three ways: depreciation (which may sometimes be accelerated), tax credits, and carryover losses which reduce tax liability charged against income from other sources for a period of 27.5 years. [S47] Some tax shelter benefits can be transferable, depending on the laws governing tax liability in the jurisdiction where the property is located. [S48] These can be sold to others for a cash return or other benefits. [S49] Equity build-up is the increase in the investor's equity ratio as the portion of debt service payments devoted to principal accrue over time. [S50] Equity build-up counts as positive cash flow from the asset where the debt service payment is made out of income from the property, rather than from independent income sources. [S51] Capital appreciation is the increase in the market value of the asset over time, realized as a cash flow when the property is sold. [S52] Capital appreciation can be very unpredictable unless it is part of a development and improvement strategy. [S53] The purchase of a property for which the majority of the projected cash flows are expected from capital appreciation (prices going up) rather than other sources is considered speculation rather than investment. [S54] Research results that found that real estate firms are more likely to take a smaller stake in larger assets when investing abroad (Mauck & Price, 2017). [S55] ## Foreclosure investment\n\nSome individuals and companies focus their investment strategy on purchasing properties that are in some stage of foreclosure. [S56] A property is considered in pre-foreclosure when the homeowner has defaulted on their mortgage loan. [S57] Formal foreclosure processes vary by state and may be judicial or non-judicial, which affects the length of time the property is in the pre-foreclosure phase. [S58] Once the formal foreclosure processes are underway, these properties can be purchased at a public sale, usually called a foreclosure auction or sheriff's sale. [S59] If the property does not sell at the public auction, then ownership of the property is returned to the lender. [S60] Properties at this phase are called Real Estate Owned, or REOs. [S61] Once a property is sold at the foreclosure auction or as an REO, the lender may keep the proceeds to satisfy their mortgage and any legal costs that they incurred minus the costs of the sale and any outstanding tax obligations. [S62] The foreclosing bank or lending institution has the right to continue to honor tenant leases (if there are tenants in the property) during the REO phase but usually, the bank wants the property vacant to sell it more easily. [S63] ### Buy, rehab, rent and refinance\n\nBuy, rehab, rent, refinance (BRRR) is a real estate investment strategy, used by real estate investors who have experience renovating or rehabbing properties to \"flip\" houses. [S64] BRRR is different from \"flipping\" houses. [S65] Flipping houses implies buying a property and quickly selling it for a profit, with or without repairs. [S66] BRRR is a long-term investment strategy that involves renting out a property and letting it appreciate in value before selling it. [S67] Renting out a BRRR property provides a stable passive income source that is used to cover mortgage payments while home price appreciation increases future capital gains. [S68] The phrase was slightly updated in a 2022 Bloomberg News article noting that BiggerPockets added \"Repeat\" to the end, making it \"BRRRR\" to describe a real estate investing strategy of Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. [S69] ## Impact\n\nAccording to Lima et al. [S70] (2022), in Ireland, the financialization of rental housing, which includes the entry of institutional investors into urban rental housing markets, contributed to structural factors that create homelessness directly by worsening affordability and security in the private rental market, and indirectly by influencing state policy. [S71] It was found that the history, politics, and geography of the REITs cause the collapse of Irelands market (Waldron, 2018)."
