[S4] AIMMS SC Navigator, launched in 2017, is built on the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and provides configurable Apps for supply chain teams. [S5] SC Navigator provides supply chain analytics to non-advanced users. [S6] ## History\n\nAIMMS B.V. [S7] was founded in 1989 by mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. [S8] His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. [S9] In Bisschop's view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. [S10] AIMMS began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. [S11] AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages. [S12] Bisschop was awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language. [S13] In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm. [S14] This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. [S15] In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who do not have a technical background. [S16] This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. [S17] The company grew and was in 2017 recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands, and was named one of the fastest-growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year. [S18] ## AIMMS SC Navigator Platform\n\nAlong with a growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, AIMMS developed the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform to allow for supply chain analytics. [S19] It was launched in October 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales & Operations Planning and Data Navigator. [S20] In 2018 they added Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. [S21] ## AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform\n\nThe AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an algebraic modeling language, an integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models, and a graphical end-user environment. [S22] AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface. [S23] Supported solvers include CPLEX, MOSEK, FICO Xpress, CBC, Conopt, MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO and CP Optimizer. [S24] AIMMS features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles. [S25] Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all algebraic modeling languages, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. [S26] Units of measurement are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors. [S27] Procedures and control flow statements are available in AIMMS for\n\n* the exchange of data with external data sources such as spreadsheets, databases, XML and text files\n* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models\n* user interface event handling\n* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know how the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform differs from AIMMS SC Navigator and the technical features that support their functionality.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find the relevant information. Let me start by scanning the context for mentions of both platforms and their differences.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section that directly compares the two. Specifically, [S3] says the Prescriptive Analytics Platform allows advanced users to develop optimization-based apps and deploy them to business users. Then [S4] mentions that AIMMS SC Navigator, launched in 2017, is built on the Prescriptive Platform and provides configurable Apps for supply chain teams. [S5] adds that SC Navigator offers supply chain analytics to non-advanced users. So the main difference seems to be the target audience: advanced users vs. non-advanced supply chain teams.\n\nNext, the technical features. For the Prescriptive Analytics Platform, [S22] describes it as having an algebraic modeling language, an IDE for editing models and creating GUIs, and a graphical end-user environment. It also links to multiple solvers via the Open Solver Interface, listed in [S23] and [S24]. The programming styles are mentioned in [S25], with declarative elements for models and imperative for data handling and algorithms. [S27] talks about units of measurement and runtime analysis. Also, [S28] mentions procedures and control flow for data exchange, processing, and hybrid algorithms.\n\nFor SC Navigator, since it's built on the Prescriptive Platform, its technical features would leverage those, but the key point is that it's configured with Apps for supply chain, as per [S19] and [S20]. The technical support would include the underlying solvers and modeling capabilities, but the specific Apps are the main feature.\n\nI need to structure the answer by first stating the differences, citing the relevant sentences, then the technical features, citing the appropriate sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with citations. Check that all citations are correctly numbered and that each sentence is properly attributed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the historical milestones and strategic partnerships that have shaped AIMMS's evolution and how they impacted its product offerings. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Let me start by scanning each passage for relevant information.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section titled \"History\" which mentions several key points. For example, AIMMS was founded in 1989 by Johannes Bisschop under the name Paragon Decision Technology. That's a historical milestone. His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models instead of programming. That probably influenced their product direction towards user-friendly modeling.\n\nThen, in 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a private equity firm, leading to a partnership program and technical investments. This acquisition likely provided resources for further development. The launch of AIMMS PRO in 2011 allowed deployment to non-technical users, which is a product evolution. Also, the ability to publish applications via a browser in 2011 made their tools more accessible, impacting product offerings by making them more user-friendly and device-independent.\n\nIn 2017, the company was recognized as a top B2B tech in the Netherlands and named a fast-growing company. That's another milestone. Also, the launch of AIMMS SC Navigator in 2017, built on the Prescriptive Analytics Platform, targeting supply chain analytics. This shows a strategic move into specific industry applications, expanding their product line.\n\nLooking at strategic partnerships, the context mentions collaboration with GE Grid and the Midwest ISO, which won the Edelman Award in 2011. Another partnership with TNT Express, which won an award in 2012. The Dutch Delta team's project in 2013 also used AIMMS. These partnerships likely validated their technology and influenced product development by showing real-world applications and success, prompting further enhancements.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's mention of AIMMS being used in various industries and specific examples like GE Grid. The use cases in different sectors might have driven the need for more specialized tools, leading to products like SC Navigator.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with these points, making sure to cite the correct sentence numbers. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with citations in <cite>. I need to ensure that each historical milestone and partnership is linked to the relevant impact on product offerings.\n\nFor example, the founding in 1989 (S6) and the vision (S8) shaped the initial product focus. The 2003 acquisition (S13) led to partnership programs and technical investment (S14), affecting product evolution. The 2011 launch of AIMMS PRO (S15) and browser access (S16) impacted product accessibility. The 2017 SC Navigator (S19) was a product expansion. Partnerships with GE Grid (S33-S35), TNT Express (S35), and the Dutch Delta team (S36) influenced product development through real-world applications.\n\nI need to check if all these points are covered and properly cited. Also, ensure that each sentence in the answer is correctly attributed. Avoid missing any key points and make sure the flow connects milestones and partnerships to their impacts on products."

[S32] ## Use in industry\n\nAIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform is used in a wide range of industries including retail, consumer products, healthcare, oil and chemicals, steel production and agribusiness. [S33] GE Grid uses AIMMS as the modeling and optimization engine of its energy market clearing software. [S34] Together with GE Grid, AIMMS was part of the analytics team of Midwest ISO that won the Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences of 2011 for successfully applying operations research in the Midwest ISO energy market. [S35] In 2012, TNT Express, an AIMMS customer won the Franz Edleman Award for modernizing its operations and reducing its carbon footprint. [S36] The AIMMS platform was also used by the Dutch Delta team to develop and implement a new method for calculating the most efficient levels of flood protection for the Netherlands and won the Edelman prize in 2013.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] AIMMS\n\n\n# AIMMS\n\n\n\n**AIMMS** (acronym for **Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System**) is a prescriptive analytics software company with offices in the Netherlands, United States, and Singapore. [S2] It has two main product offerings that provide modeling and optimization capabilities across a variety of industries. [S3] The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform allows advanced users to develop optimization-based applications and deploy them to business users. [S4] AIMMS SC Navigator, launched in 2017, is built on the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and provides configurable Apps for supply chain teams. [S5] SC Navigator provides supply chain analytics to non-advanced users. [S6] ## History\n\nAIMMS B.V. [S7] was founded in 1989 by mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. [S8] His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. [S9] In Bisschop's view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. [S10] AIMMS began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. [S11] AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages. [S12] Bisschop was awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language. [S13] In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm. [S14] This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. [S15] In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who do not have a technical background. [S16] This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. [S17] The company grew and was in 2017 recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands, and was named one of the fastest-growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year. [S18] ## AIMMS SC Navigator Platform\n\nAlong with a growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, AIMMS developed the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform to allow for supply chain analytics. [S19] It was launched in October 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales & Operations Planning and Data Navigator. [S20] In 2018 they added Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. [S21] ## AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform\n\nThe AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an algebraic modeling language, an integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models, and a graphical end-user environment. [S22] AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface. [S23] Supported solvers include CPLEX, MOSEK, FICO Xpress, CBC, Conopt, MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO and CP Optimizer. [S24] AIMMS features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles. [S25] Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all algebraic modeling languages, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. [S26] Units of measurement are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors. [S27] Procedures and control flow statements are available in AIMMS for\n\n* the exchange of data with external data sources such as spreadsheets, databases, XML and text files\n* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models\n* user interface event handling\n* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how AIMMS facilitates the integration of optimization models into broader applications and what programming capabilities it offers for that.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passages again. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a mention that optimization solutions can be used as a standalone app or embedded as a software component (S31). That's one way they integrate. Also, the GMP system library allows building custom algorithms (S30). \n\nIn Passage 2, there's info about AIMMS PRO, which deploys applications to non-technical users (S15, S16). The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform has an IDE and links to multiple solvers (S22, S23). The programming capabilities include declarative and imperative styles (S25), data exchange with external sources (S28), and user model libraries for reusing components.\n\nSo, the integration methods are embedding as components, using GMP for custom algorithms, and deploying via AIMMS PRO. Programming capabilities include declarative/impertive programming, data handling, control flow, and libraries.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Let me check each part again to ensure I didn't miss anything. Also, verify the sentence numbers are correct. For example, S31 for embedding, S30 for GMP, S22/S23 for solvers, S25/S28 for programming features. Yes, that seems right. Okay, time to put it all together in the required format."
