      "answer": "<statement>The Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) aligns its funding criteria with its purpose of strengthening Canada's position in the knowledge economy by prioritizing projects that demonstrate research quality, innovation capacity, and potential national benefits. Specifically, the CFI\u2019s criteria require proposals to support institutional strategic research plans, ensure infrastructure needs are met, and contribute to private-sector innovation and high-quality job creation, as outlined in its mandate to \"strengthen Canada's position in today's knowledge economy\" [S2][S6].<cite>[S2][S6]</cite></statement><statement>The CFI\u2019s governance structure reinforces this alignment through its independent board of directors, which ensures accountability to the Canadian public via a \"Members\" governing body representing public interests. This structure, including annual public meetings and a five-year term for Members, ensures transparency and strategic focus on long-term economic and research goals [S9][S10][S12][S13].<cite>[S9][S10][S12][S13]</cite></statement><statement>Additionally, the CFI\u2019s funding model\u2014limiting support to 40% of infrastructure costs while leveraging partnerships from public, private, and non-profit sectors\u2014maximizes resource impact, directly supporting its goal of fostering innovation and economic growth through collaborative investment [S7][S8].<cite>[S7][S8]</cite></statement>",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the Canada Foundation for Innovation's (CFI) funding criteria and governance structure align with its stated purpose of strengthening Canada's position in the knowledge economy.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections: Creation, Funding, Governance, Criticism, and External projects/facilities. The question is about funding criteria and governance structure, so I should focus on those sections.\n\nStarting with the Funding section. The passage mentions that the CFI's purpose is to \"help build and sustain a research landscape in Canada that will attract and retain the world's top talent, train the next generation of researchers, support private-sector innovation and create high-quality jobs that strengthen Canada's position in today's knowledge economy\" [S2]. Then, under Funding, it says that the CFI's infrastructure includes equipment, labs, etc., necessary for research [S3]. The merit-review process uses experts to ensure only the best projects get funding [S4]. Funding is awarded to institutions, not individuals, and proposals must support the institution's strategic research plan [S5]. The criteria for funding are the quality of research, need for infrastructure, contribution to innovation capacity, and potential benefits to Canada [S6]. They fund up to 40% of costs, leveraging other investments [S7][S8].\n\nSo, the funding criteria align with the purpose by focusing on quality research, innovation, and benefits to Canada. The governance structure is mentioned in the Governance section. The CFI is an independent corporation with a board of directors meeting 3-4 times a year [S9]. The board reports to Members, who are public representatives, and there's an annual meeting [S10][S11][S12][S13]. This structure ensures accountability to the public, which supports the goal of strengthening the knowledge economy by maintaining transparency and public interest.\n\nI need to make sure each statement in the answer cites the correct sentences. For example, when talking about funding criteria, cite S2 (the purpose), S6 (the criteria), and S8 (leveraging funds). For governance, cite S9-S13. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. The answer should link each part of the funding and governance to the stated purpose. Make sure each sentence in the response has the correct citations."
