      "question": "What factors contributed to the global competition in supplying shark fins to China, and how did Costa Rica's position in this trade develop over time?",
      "answer": "<statement>The global competition in supplying shark fins to China was driven by the increasing demand from China's growing economy and middle class, which made shark fin soup accessible to more people, as well as the perception of shark fins as having nutritional value and health benefits. Additionally, the demand from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, coupled with the high price of shark fin soup, fueled the market, with China importing 4,240 tonnes of shark fins in 1998 alone. This demand attracted competition from countries like Japan, Spain, Singapore, Indonesia, and Costa Rica, which sought to meet the needs of the Chinese market.<cite>[S38][S39][S40][S41][S43]</cite></statement><statement>Costa Rica's position in the shark fin trade developed after receiving technical support and financing from Taiwan in 1982, which modernized its fishing fleet. This allowed vessels to use longline technology to increase catches, leading to the growth of the finning industry in the 1980s. By the late 1990s, Costa Rica became a key cargo-unloading point for international fleets, solidifying its role in the global finning industry. Despite a 2012 law banning shark finning, an illegal market persisted, and Costa Rica remained a major participant in the trade.<cite>[S23][S24][S25][S27][S33][S34][S35]</cite></statement>",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that contributed to the global competition in supplying shark fins to China and how Costa Rica's position in this trade developed over time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and identify the relevant sentences. Let me start by breaking down the question into two parts: factors contributing to global competition and the development of Costa Rica's position.\n\nFor the first part, the factors leading to global competition. The passage mentions several points. There's the demand from China's growing economy and middle class, as stated in S38. Also, the high price of shark fin soup and its use in celebrations (S39, S40) might contribute. Additionally, the mention of various countries competing in the Chinese market (S43) like Japan, Spain, etc., shows the competition. The economic growth of the Tiger economies in the Pacific Rim (S26) could also be a factor. The demand from Hong Kong and the mainland China (S37, S38) is another point. Also, the perception of shark fins as having nutritional value (S41) might drive demand.\n\nNow, for Costa Rica's development. The passage starts with the technical support from Taiwan in 1982 (S23), leading to modernized fishing fleets. This allowed them to venture further and use longlines (S25), increasing catches. By the 1980s, the finning industry took off (S24). By the late 90s, Costa Rica became a major cargo point (S27). The 2003 incident with the Taiwanese vessel (S28-29) shows their role in the trade, even with lack of enforcement. The 2006/2007 documentary (S30-32) exposed the illegal trade. Despite the 2012 law (S34), there's still an illegal market (S35). Also, Costa Rica's position as a key player (S33) is mentioned.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check if each citation is correctly numbered. Also, ensure that the answer addresses both parts of the question: factors and Costa Rica's development over time."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Shark fin trading in Costa Rica\n\n\n# Shark fin trading in Costa Rica\n\n\n\n**Shark fin trading in Costa Rica**, or shark finning, is an illegal practice in the country. [S2] It poses a serious threat to shark populations besides the organized crime involvement in the practice within Costa Rica. [S3] The trade in Costa Rica is vigorously controlled by the Taiwanese mafia because of the high value of shark fins in restaurants in the Pacific Rim countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and China where Shark fin soup can cost up to $100 a serving in top restaurants. [S4] Some 95% of shark fin trading activity in Costa Rica culminates in the docks of Puntarenas on the western coast, notably Inversiones Cruz Dock and Harezan Dock, which are often privately run by the Taiwanese. [S5] The industry in Costa Rica took off from the 1970s as a result of the growth in demand from the emerging wealthy Tiger economies of the Asia-Pacific for shark fin as a delicacy. [S6] By the 1990s, the shark fin industry in Costa Rica had become one of the world's most important in shark finning, especially as a major cargo-unloading point for international fleets because of tax laws and government corruption in cracking down on the trade. [S7] However, there is environmental awareness of the consequences of fin trade exploitation which could result in shark extinction. [S8] Prompted by WildAid\u2019s campaigns, in East Asia, high profile politicians and their kin, film personalities, industrial establishments and committed individuals took voluntary \u201cNo shark fin\u201d pledge. [S9] In January 2011, British chef Gordon Ramsay spoke of how he and his TV crew were held at gunpoint and soaked with petrol when filming a documentary about the illegal trade in Costa Rica. [S10] ## Practice\n\nIn response to poor incomes and pressure, local fisherman are forced into harvesting shark fins, despite only getting about one dollar per pound on an average, less than a third of its total retail value. [S11] Corrupt politicians are silenced with a fee to ignore government regulations. [S12] The practice involves sharks being caught by a horizontal drag line with many baited hooks, known as longline fishing. [S13] According to biologist Jorge Ballestero of the Costa Rican Sea Turtle Restoration Project (Pretoma), \u201cCosta Rica has become intricately linked to this trade for two reasons: It has the biggest longliner fleet in the hemisphere, and it allows international vessels dedicated to the exploitation and trade of shark fins to land here.\u201d\n\nThe Taiwanese mafia dominate the shark finning industry in Costa Rica, although Indonesian gangs also have a foothold in the market. [S14] The Taiwanese and Indonesian mafia operate private docks in the Puntarenas area, notably Inversiones Cruz Dock and Harezan Dock and several others where some 95% of all catches are brought in, transported by truck to San Jos\u00e9 and flown mostly to Hong Kong. [S15] According to the Costa Rican customs adviser Omar Jiminez, at least three boats full of shark fins enter the ports in Puntarenas every week. [S16] Kaohsiung in Taiwan is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing shark fins. [S17] They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port. [S18] However, various shark cartilage industries in the country exist, depending on the import of cartilages from other countries. [S19] Costa Rica is mentioned as one such country where a leading processing plant is said to be purchasing raw cartilages from any source in the world to carry out semi or primary processing before exporting it, particularly to the USA. [S20] The USA then markets it worldwide in the processed shark cartilage powder form, under four or five brand names. [S21] ## History\n\nIn the 1970s, mass local and reef fishing off the Central America coasts had a profound effect on coastal shark populations throughout the Americas. [S22] FAO initiated action in 1999 to introduce a \u201cVoluntary Plan of Action for sharks.\u201d\n\nPassage 2:\n[S46] Another large demand for shark cartilage is for manufacture of \"Shark Cartilage Powder\" or pills as a cure for cancer. [S47] The anti cancer claims of such powders marketed in many parts of the world has been discounted by the US Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commissions. [S48] In spite of such injunctions, the trade in this powder continues and the shark cartilage powder is still widely marketed as a cancer cure, stated to be selling at US$145 per gram. [S49] It is also stated that in Costa Rica, one single firm alone processed 235,000 sharks every month to manufacture cartilage pills. [S50] ## Environmental concerns\n\nSince the late 1980s populations of northwest Atlantic coastal and oceanic shark have dropped by an average of 70%, and in 2003 the World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimated that tens of millions of sharks are finned and discarded at sea every year. [S51] However, estimates are muddy given the fact that the sharks and their fins cross-cut different fishing markets (not to mention that the vast majority of sharks are exploited in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica as opposed to the Atlantic coast). [S52] The major environmental problem facing Costa Rican waters by mass shark finning is that the fishermen involved in the practice of killing sharks for their fins pay no attention to the age, gender, size, or even the species of shark. [S53] Young sharks may be killed off, drastically affecting the ability to breed. [S54] A further biological complication is that sharks are naturally slow to breed and mature, which makes the possibility of extinction for many shark species in Costa Rican waters increasingly ominous. [S55] As far back as 1999, FAO initiated action to introduce a \u201cVoluntary Plan of Action for sharks.\u201d The response, though not spontaneous, received support from 15 countries including Costa Rica. [S56] Even in the early 2000s, the fin trade market's influence on over exploitation of fins was realized, with many countries imposing ban on fishing of these species. [S57] Goaded by WildAid's campaigns in East Asia, high-profile politicians and their kin, film personalities, industrial establishments and committed individuals took voluntary \u201cNo shark fin\u201d pledge and many personalities hosted banquets with \u201cshark free\u201d announcements. [S58] There is now constant publicity in the media in this regard in eastern Asia. [S59] ## Crackdown\n\nFormer Costa Rican president Abel Pacheco, a noted environmentalist, and his Taiwanese counterpart, Chen Shui-Bian began a crackdown on shark finning in the early 2000s. [S60] However, enforcement is nearly impossible because of corrupt politicians and the terror created by the Taiwanese mafia preventing officials from making a stand against the trading. [S61] A reform bill has been proposed in Congress since the late 1990s in which a law would be passed entailing a prison term of up to two years for any perpetrator involved in the trafficking of fins that have been cut from sharks\u2019 bodies before the catch has reached the dock. [S62] In this context, Pretoma has obtained a petition of over 20,000 signatures calling for the suspension of landing permits for foreign fishing vessels. [S63] Although the opposition to the trading is high and indeed illegal, effectively cracking down on the industry will be difficult as long as law enforcement and monitoring of fishing vessels is slack and corruption and poverty remain. [S64] The Taiwanese and Indonesian mafia even run their own private docks in Puntarenas which are known to the government and the Costa Rican police but incoming vessels are rarely inspected in a climate of fear. [S65] The port of Puntarenas, as of 2003, only had three inspectors allocated to the inspection of hundreds of vessels and generally only examines about 20% of them. [S66] As of 2003, no full-scale government investigation has been instituted into the port of Puntarenas, widely known to be the linch-pin of the illegal Costa Rican shark fin trading industry. [S67] In 2007, Costa Rica was again internationally criticized for its handling of sharkfinning.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the source documents describe the involvement of private docks and international networks in the shark fin trade, and what evidence is provided.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has multiple sentences with citations. Let me scan through each part.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, sentence S4 mentions that 95% of shark fin trading in Costa Rica ends at Puntarenas docks, specifically Inversiones Cruz Dock and Harezan Dock, which are privately run by the Taiwanese. That's a key point about private docks. Then S14 says the Taiwanese and Indonesian mafia operate private docks in Puntarenas, including those two docks, where 95% of catches are brought in. So that's more evidence on private docks. \n\nFor international networks, S3 mentions the Taiwanese mafia's control due to high value in Pacific Rim countries like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. S15 states that shark fins are transported to San Jos\u00e9 and flown mostly to Hong Kong. Also, S16 mentions that at least three boats enter Puntarenas weekly, and S17 says Kaohsiung in Taiwan is a major port for importing shark fins. Additionally, S19 and S20 talk about Costa Rica's processing plant exporting to the USA. So international networks involve Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and the USA.\n\nAnother point is S13, which mentions that Costa Rica's longliner fleet and allowing international vessels make it a key point for the trade. Also, S12 mentions longline fishing, which is a method used, but maybe that's more about the method than the networks.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with citations. Let me structure the answer with each relevant sentence and their citations. Check if all the evidence is covered. For example, the private docks are mentioned in S4, S14, S15. International networks in S3, S15, S17, S19, S20. Also, S16 about the boats entering weekly. \n\nWait, the user also asks for evidence provided. So each citation is the evidence. Need to make sure each statement is a sentence from the passage with the correct citations. Let me compile the answer accordingly."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the sequence of events and factors that led Costa Rica to become a major player in the global shark-fin trade, and how the 2003 incident with Manuel Silva highlighted enforcement issues.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the sentences to find relevant information. \n\nStarting with the early part: [S23] mentions that in 1982, Costa Rica's National Learning Institute got support from Taiwan to modernize their fishing fleet. Then [S24] says this led to the finning industry taking off in the 80s, especially after 1986. [S25] explains that because local shark populations were low, the new vessels could go further and use longlines, increasing catches. [S26] connects this to meeting demand from Pacific Rim countries, contributing to economic growth. [S27] states that by the late 90s, Costa Rica became a key point for international fleets in the finning industry. \n\nSo the sequence here is the modernization of the fleet in the 80s leading to increased fishing, which then made Costa Rica a major player. The factors include the technical support from Taiwan, the shift to longline fishing, and the demand from other countries.\n\nNow, the 2003 incident: [S28] talks about Manuel Silva reporting a Taiwanese vessel with 30 tons of fins. [S29] says the agencies ignored it and Incopesca didn't act. This shows systemic issues in enforcement, as the authorities didn't respond despite the report. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the emergence, [S23][S24][S25][S26][S27] are the key points. For the 2003 incident, [S28][S29]. \n\nWait, the question also asks how the 2003 incident highlighted systemic issues. The answer should link the failure of the agencies and Incopesca to take action as part of the systemic problems. \n\nAlso, check if there's more context. The passage mentions that shark finning was made illegal in 2012, but there's still an illegal market. However, the question is about the emergence and the 2003 incident, so maybe that's not needed here. \n\nPutting it all together, the answer should outline the sequence from 1982 modernization, leading to increased fishing and Costa Rica's role, then the 2003 event showing enforcement failures. Each part needs citations from the relevant sentences."

The user is asking about the legal measures taken against shark finning in Costa Rica and why the illegal market still exists despite those measures.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find the relevant information. Let me scan each sentence.\n\nStarting with the legal measures. I remember seeing something about Costa Rica making shark finning illegal in 2012. Let me check. Yes, [S34] states that \"Shark finning in Costa Rica was made illegal in 2012, signed into law by President Chinchilla.\" That's a key point. So the legal measure was the 2012 law.\n\nNow, the second part: why does the illegal market persist? The passage mentions that there's still a viable illegal market present, cited in [S35]. But why? Looking at the context, there's information about demand. For example, [S36] talks about the demand in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. Also, [S37]-[S42] discuss the high demand and economic factors. Additionally, there's mention of Costa Rica's role as a major participant in the trade [S33], and past issues with enforcement, like in [S28]-[S29] where authorities didn't act on reports. \n\nSo the reasons would include high demand, especially from China, the economic incentives, and possibly weak enforcement despite the law. The passage also mentions that even after the law, the illegal market exists, which is directly stated in [S35]. \n\nI need to structure the answer with the legal measure first, citing [S34], then the reasons citing the demand factors and possible enforcement issues. The citations for the reasons would be [S35][S36][S37][S38][S42], maybe others. Let me check again. The demand from China is in [S38], the economic growth allowing more people to afford it. Also, [S36] mentions the demand in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. The persistence of the illegal market is directly in [S35], but the reasons are in the demand sections. \n\nSo the answer would be: Legal measure was the 2012 law (S34). The illegal market persists due to high demand, especially from China's growing middle class (S38), economic factors (S37), and possibly enforcement issues (S28-S29). Also, the market's growth (S42) and the perception of nutritional value (S40). But the passage doesn't explicitly mention enforcement issues after 2012, only that in 2003 there was inaction. However, the existence of the illegal market despite the law is mentioned in S35. So maybe the answer should cite S35 and the demand factors."

    "[S1] Shark fin trading in Costa Rica\n\n\n# Shark fin trading in Costa Rica\n\n\n\n**Shark fin trading in Costa Rica**, or shark finning, is an illegal practice in the country. [S2] It poses a serious threat to shark populations besides the organized crime involvement in the practice within Costa Rica. [S3] The trade in Costa Rica is vigorously controlled by the Taiwanese mafia because of the high value of shark fins in restaurants in the Pacific Rim countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and China where Shark fin soup can cost up to $100 a serving in top restaurants. [S4] Some 95% of shark fin trading activity in Costa Rica culminates in the docks of Puntarenas on the western coast, notably Inversiones Cruz Dock and Harezan Dock, which are often privately run by the Taiwanese. [S5] The industry in Costa Rica took off from the 1970s as a result of the growth in demand from the emerging wealthy Tiger economies of the Asia-Pacific for shark fin as a delicacy. [S6] By the 1990s, the shark fin industry in Costa Rica had become one of the world's most important in shark finning, especially as a major cargo-unloading point for international fleets because of tax laws and government corruption in cracking down on the trade. [S7] However, there is environmental awareness of the consequences of fin trade exploitation which could result in shark extinction. [S8] Prompted by WildAid\u2019s campaigns, in East Asia, high profile politicians and their kin, film personalities, industrial establishments and committed individuals took voluntary \u201cNo shark fin\u201d pledge. [S9] In January 2011, British chef Gordon Ramsay spoke of how he and his TV crew were held at gunpoint and soaked with petrol when filming a documentary about the illegal trade in Costa Rica. [S10] ## Practice\n\nIn response to poor incomes and pressure, local fisherman are forced into harvesting shark fins, despite only getting about one dollar per pound on an average, less than a third of its total retail value. [S11] Corrupt politicians are silenced with a fee to ignore government regulations. [S12] The practice involves sharks being caught by a horizontal drag line with many baited hooks, known as longline fishing. [S13] According to biologist Jorge Ballestero of the Costa Rican Sea Turtle Restoration Project (Pretoma), \u201cCosta Rica has become intricately linked to this trade for two reasons: It has the biggest longliner fleet in the hemisphere, and it allows international vessels dedicated to the exploitation and trade of shark fins to land here.\u201d\n\nThe Taiwanese mafia dominate the shark finning industry in Costa Rica, although Indonesian gangs also have a foothold in the market. [S14] The Taiwanese and Indonesian mafia operate private docks in the Puntarenas area, notably Inversiones Cruz Dock and Harezan Dock and several others where some 95% of all catches are brought in, transported by truck to San Jos\u00e9 and flown mostly to Hong Kong. [S15] According to the Costa Rican customs adviser Omar Jiminez, at least three boats full of shark fins enter the ports in Puntarenas every week. [S16] Kaohsiung in Taiwan is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing shark fins. [S17] They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port. [S18] However, various shark cartilage industries in the country exist, depending on the import of cartilages from other countries. [S19] Costa Rica is mentioned as one such country where a leading processing plant is said to be purchasing raw cartilages from any source in the world to carry out semi or primary processing before exporting it, particularly to the USA. [S20] The USA then markets it worldwide in the processed shark cartilage powder form, under four or five brand names. [S21] ## History\n\nIn the 1970s, mass local and reef fishing off the Central America coasts had a profound effect on coastal shark populations throughout the Americas. [S22] FAO initiated action in 1999 to introduce a \u201cVoluntary Plan of Action for sharks.\u201d",
    "[S23] In 1982, the National Learning Institute of Costa Rica received technical support and financing from the Taiwanese government to modernize its fishing fleet according to Pretoma. [S24] This had a major impact on the finning industry in Costa Rica, which subsequently took off in the 1980s (especially after 1986). [S25] Due to low shark populations on the coasts, the updated vessels could now venture further out to sea and use longline technology to greatly increase their catches. [S26] Meeting the increasing demand in the Tiger economies of the Pacific Rim countries for shark fins brought about their economic growth and increased wealth in the 1980s and 1990s. [S27] By the late 1990s, Costa Rica had become established as a major cargo-unloading point for international fleets and thus became a key component in the global finning industry. [S28] In May 2003, a young Costa Rican Coast Guard official, Manuel Silva, reported the landing of a Taiwanese fishing vessel with 30 tons of shark fins on board. [S29] Not only were the Taiwanese vessels ignored by the four agencies charged with checking incoming cargos but the Costa Rican Fishing Institute (Incopesca) also failed to take action following his report. [S30] In 2006/2007, Canadian director Rob Stewart went to Costa Rica and the Galapagos to shoot what he thought would be an innocent documentary after sharklife underwater in the film *Sharkwater*. [S31] However, shortly into filming, they stumbled across the Taiwanese mafia, the illegal shark fin trade and, feared for their lives when chased by gunboats. [S32] They managed to secretly capture footage of the traders in the film. [S33] Today, Costa Rica is one of the world's most important participants in the shark-fin trade. [S34] Shark finning in Costa Rica was made illegal in 2012, signed into law by President Chinchilla. [S35] There is still a viable illegal market present. [S36] ## Demand\n\nIn Hong Kong restaurants, where the market has traditionally been strong, Shark fin soup can fetch up to $100 a serving in the top restaurants. [S37] However, the demand from Hong Kong natives has reportedly dropped, but this has been more than balanced by an increase in demand from the Chinese mainland, fueled by its growing economy and increased wealth, as the economic growth of China has put this expensive delicacy within the reach of a growing middle class. [S38] This increase in demand, combined with the importance of this top predator in the ocean, has the potential to significantly alter oceanic ecosystems. [S39] The high price of the soup means that it is often used as a way to impress guests or at celebrations. [S40] Shark fin is also incorrectly perceived by some as having high nutritional value, as well as cancer and osteoarthritis fighting abilities. [S41] Based on information gathered from the Hong Kong trade in fins, the market is estimated to be growing by 5% a year. [S42] In 1998, China imported a reported 4,240 tonnes of shark fins worth US$24.7\u00a0million, but Costa Rica competed with Japan, Spain, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Norway, Ecuador, Peru and Fiji in providing for the Chinese market. [S43] In China, shark fins are increasingly being used in less extravagant items such as cakes, cookies, bread and even cat food. [S44] In the South Asian region, use of shark cartilage in preparing soups is considered a health tonic. [S45] Hong Kong imports it from North and South American countries, particularly for use in either a cooked format or to prepare boiled soup, as a health fad, by mixing it with herbal supplements.",
    "[S46] Another large demand for shark cartilage is for manufacture of \"Shark Cartilage Powder\" or pills as a cure for cancer. [S47] The anti cancer claims of such powders marketed in many parts of the world has been discounted by the US Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commissions. [S48] In spite of such injunctions, the trade in this powder continues and the shark cartilage powder is still widely marketed as a cancer cure, stated to be selling at US$145 per gram. [S49] It is also stated that in Costa Rica, one single firm alone processed 235,000 sharks every month to manufacture cartilage pills. [S50] ## Environmental concerns\n\nSince the late 1980s populations of northwest Atlantic coastal and oceanic shark have dropped by an average of 70%, and in 2003 the World Conservation Union (IUCN) estimated that tens of millions of sharks are finned and discarded at sea every year. [S51] However, estimates are muddy given the fact that the sharks and their fins cross-cut different fishing markets (not to mention that the vast majority of sharks are exploited in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica as opposed to the Atlantic coast). [S52] The major environmental problem facing Costa Rican waters by mass shark finning is that the fishermen involved in the practice of killing sharks for their fins pay no attention to the age, gender, size, or even the species of shark. [S53] Young sharks may be killed off, drastically affecting the ability to breed. [S54] A further biological complication is that sharks are naturally slow to breed and mature, which makes the possibility of extinction for many shark species in Costa Rican waters increasingly ominous. [S55] As far back as 1999, FAO initiated action to introduce a \u201cVoluntary Plan of Action for sharks.\u201d The response, though not spontaneous, received support from 15 countries including Costa Rica. [S56] Even in the early 2000s, the fin trade market's influence on over exploitation of fins was realized, with many countries imposing ban on fishing of these species. [S57] Goaded by WildAid's campaigns in East Asia, high-profile politicians and their kin, film personalities, industrial establishments and committed individuals took voluntary \u201cNo shark fin\u201d pledge and many personalities hosted banquets with \u201cshark free\u201d announcements. [S58] There is now constant publicity in the media in this regard in eastern Asia. [S59] ## Crackdown\n\nFormer Costa Rican president Abel Pacheco, a noted environmentalist, and his Taiwanese counterpart, Chen Shui-Bian began a crackdown on shark finning in the early 2000s. [S60] However, enforcement is nearly impossible because of corrupt politicians and the terror created by the Taiwanese mafia preventing officials from making a stand against the trading. [S61] A reform bill has been proposed in Congress since the late 1990s in which a law would be passed entailing a prison term of up to two years for any perpetrator involved in the trafficking of fins that have been cut from sharks\u2019 bodies before the catch has reached the dock. [S62] In this context, Pretoma has obtained a petition of over 20,000 signatures calling for the suspension of landing permits for foreign fishing vessels. [S63] Although the opposition to the trading is high and indeed illegal, effectively cracking down on the industry will be difficult as long as law enforcement and monitoring of fishing vessels is slack and corruption and poverty remain. [S64] The Taiwanese and Indonesian mafia even run their own private docks in Puntarenas which are known to the government and the Costa Rican police but incoming vessels are rarely inspected in a climate of fear. [S65] The port of Puntarenas, as of 2003, only had three inspectors allocated to the inspection of hundreds of vessels and generally only examines about 20% of them. [S66] As of 2003, no full-scale government investigation has been instituted into the port of Puntarenas, widely known to be the linch-pin of the illegal Costa Rican shark fin trading industry. [S67] In 2007, Costa Rica was again internationally criticized for its handling of sharkfinning."
