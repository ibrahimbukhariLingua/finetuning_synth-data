      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary function of the main 111-meter tower in Arter Kvartal and which company will be its occupant. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. Let me scan through each sentence. \n\nPassage 1 starts by introducing Arter Kvartal as a high-rise complex in Tallinn. Sentence S2 mentions the main tower is 111 meters and the third-tallest in Estonia. Then S4 talks about the description. S5 says the main building will be the headquarters of Swedbank AS. That seems directly relevant. \n\nSo the primary function is being the headquarters, and the occupant is Swedbank AS. I should check if there's any other info. The other sentences mention Tower B and C, but the question is about the main tower. Also, S8 mentions the developer is Kapitel, but that's not the occupant. \n\nSo the answer should be that the main tower's primary function is as Swedbank's headquarters. The citations would be S5 for the occupant and S2 for the tower's height. Wait, but the question asks for the primary function and the company. The function is stated in S5, and the company is Swedbank AS. So the statement should cite S5. But maybe S2 is needed to confirm it's the main tower. However, the question specifically mentions the main 111-meter tower, so S5 already refers to the main building. \n\nSo the answer would be: The primary function is the headquarters of Swedbank AS. Citations would be [S5]. But let me check again. The user might need both the function and the company. The sentence should combine both. So the statement would be \"The primary function of the main 111-meter tower in Arter Kvartal is to serve as the headquarters of Swedbank AS.\" And cite [S5]. \n\nI don't see any other sentences mentioning the occupant. S8 mentions the developer, but not the occupant. So yes, S5 is the only citation needed here."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the unique facilities in Tower B and how its design differs from the other two towers in the Arter Kvartal complex.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions three towers: the main one, Tower B, and Tower C. \n\nStarting with Tower B. According to the passage, [S5] says Tower B is a 15-story, 63-meter office building that also facilitates a sports club and a spa. That's specific to Tower B. The other towers don't mention these facilities. The main tower is the headquarters for Swedbank, and Tower C is an apartment hotel. So the sports club and spa are unique to Tower B.\n\nNow, how does its design differ? The main tower is 28 stories and 111 meters, Tower B is 15 stories and 63 meters, and Tower C is 9 stories and 39 meters. So Tower B is shorter than the main tower but taller than Tower C. Also, the main building is the third-tallest in Estonia, but Tower B's design includes the sports club and spa. The passage also mentions that all three buildings are connected by a glass-roofed atrium, but that's common to all, so not a difference. The design differences would be the height and the facilities. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The info about Tower B's facilities is from [S5]. The other details about the buildings' heights and stories are in [S2], [S5], [S6], and [S7]. But for the unique facilities, only [S5] is relevant. The design differences would reference the height details from [S2] and [S5]. \n\nSo the answer should state that Tower B has a sports club and spa, citing [S5], and mention its height (15 stories, 63m) compared to the other towers, citing [S2] and [S5]. Also, note that the main tower is 28 stories and 111m, and Tower C is 9 stories and 39m. The design difference is in the facilities and height. \n\nI need to structure the statements properly with citations. Each sentence should have its own citations. Let me check again to ensure I'm not missing any details. The passage doesn't mention other design specifics, so the main differences are the facilities and the height."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the three buildings of Arter Kvartal are interconnected and the significance of that architectural feature according to the source.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the three buildings: the main 28-story tower, Tower B, and Tower C. The key sentence here is [S7], which states that the three buildings will be connected by a glass-roofed atrium. That answers the first part of the question about how they're interconnected.\n\nNow, the second part is about the significance. The passage doesn't explicitly state the significance of the atrium. However, the fact that it's a glass-roofed atrium might imply architectural or functional significance, like creating a communal space or enhancing the aesthetic. But since the source doesn't mention any specific significance, I can't assume anything beyond what's written. So, there might not be a citation for the significance part. \n\nWait, the user said to provide citations if available. Since the passage only mentions the connection via the atrium but doesn't explain its significance, the answer for the significance part would have no citations. But I need to check again. Let me scan the passage again. \n\nLooking at all the sentences: [S1] to [S9]. The only mention of the atrium is [S7]. There's no other sentence that talks about the significance. So the answer would state that the buildings are connected by a glass-roofed atrium, citing [S7], but there's no information on the significance, so no citation for that part.\n\nSo the final answer should have two statements. The first explaining the connection with the atrium and citation [S7], and the second stating that the significance isn't detailed in the source, hence no citation."
