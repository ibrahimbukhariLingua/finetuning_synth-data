The supporting context has two passages. \n\nFirst, I need to look through Passage 1 because it specifically mentions challenges. Let me scan through the sentences. \n\n[S25] talks about supplier enablement as a hurdle. Then [S26] explains it's called PCard supplier enablement. [S27] says every supplier must be contacted, even if they're already a PCard supplier. [S28] mentions banks and software companies helping with the conversion. [S29] has a survey result where 61% of respondents said suppliers' resistance is a problem. [S30] states the main reason is transaction acceptance fees. [S31] notes 50% face surcharges. [S32] mentions educating suppliers as a response.\n\nNow, the question also asks how these challenges relate to the broader success of PCard programs. Looking at Passage 2, [S6] says factors contribute to success or stagnation. [S7] mentions common pitfalls to avoid. [S18] talks about A/P transactions being a growth area. [S24] says best practices expand PCard to AP, which might relate to overcoming these challenges.\n\nSo the challenges are supplier resistance due to fees and surcharges, needing education, and the conversion process itself. These relate to broader success because if suppliers aren't on board, the program can't grow, as mentioned in [S6] and [S7]. Also, [S24] suggests that expanding to AP is part of best practices, implying that addressing these challenges is crucial for success.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each challenge and cite the relevant sentences. Also, link the challenges to the broader success using the citations from both passages. Make sure each statement has the correct citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that influence the growth of PCard programs and how transaction acceptance fees and supplier surcharges impact their adoption, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context carefully. The passage has two parts: Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me start by scanning each section for relevant information.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a lot about supplier enablement and challenges. For example, [S25] mentions that supplier enablement is a hurdle in A/P PCard payment conversion. Then [S29] talks about a survey where 61% of respondents said suppliers' resistance to card payments is a problem. [S30] specifically states that transaction acceptance fees are the top reason suppliers resist. [S31] adds that nearly 50% encounter suppliers with surcharges. So these sentences directly address the factors influencing growth and the impact of fees and surcharges.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a general discussion about PCard programs. [S6] mentions that various factors contribute to success or stagnation. [S7] refers to common pitfalls and success strategies. However, the specific details about transaction fees and surcharges aren't in Passage 2. The rest of Passage 2 talks about history, usage, statistics, and issues, but not the exact factors mentioned in the question.\n\nSo the key sentences are in Passage 1: [S25], [S29], [S30], [S31]. The factors influencing growth include supplier resistance, which is driven by transaction acceptance fees and surcharges. The impact is that these fees and surcharges lead to resistance, which hinders adoption. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing these sentences. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with the appropriate citations. For example, the first statement about supplier enablement would cite [S25], then the survey result [S29], then the transaction fees [S30], and surcharges [S31]. \n\nWait, but each sentence should be a separate statement. So each fact should be its own sentence. Let me check:\n\n1. \"One hurdle in the A/P PCard payment conversion is supplier enablement.\" [S25]\n2. \"According to a joint industry survey, 'In terms of impeding an organization\u2019s card program growth, 61% of end-user respondents reported that suppliers\u2019 resistance to (or non-acceptance of) card payments is, at a minimum, somewhat of a problem.'\" [S29]\n3. \"Not surprisingly, the transaction acceptance fee factor is overwhelmingly the number-one reason suppliers give end-users for resisting or not accepting card payments.\" [S30]\n4. \"Further, nearly 50% of respondents stated they sometimes or frequently encounter suppliers that impose a surcharge in conjunction with card acceptance.\" [S31]\n\nThese four sentences directly answer the question. The factors influencing growth are supplier resistance, which is caused by transaction fees and surcharges. The impact is that these factors impede growth. \n\nI should make sure that each statement is correctly cited. Also, check if there are other sentences in Passage 2 that might be relevant. For example, [S6] mentions factors contributing to success or stagnation, but it's too general. The user wants specific factors, so the more detailed sentences from Passage 1 are better.\n\nSo the final answer should have four statements, each with their respective citations. The answer should clearly link the factors (supplier resistance, fees, surcharges) to their impact on adoption."

[S2] In the UK, purchasing cards are usually referred to as **procurement cards.**\n\nPurchasing cards are usually issued to employees who are expected to follow their organization's policies and procedures related to P-Card use, including reviewing and approving transactions according to a set schedule (at least once per month). [S3] The organization can implement a variety of controls for each P-Card; for example, a single-purchase dollar limit, a monthly limit, merchant category code (MCC) restrictions and so on.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the statistical trends and programmatic considerations that highlight the significance of PCard adoption in organizational spending, and how these align with the challenges mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Passage 1 talks about challenges like supplier enablement and resistance, while Passage 2 has more about the history, statistics, and issues of PCard adoption.\n\nStarting with statistical trends. In Passage 2, there's a mention of the 2005 Purchasing Card Benchmark Survey. The stats there are that PCard spending increased from $80B to $110B between 2003 and 2005. Also, by 2008, over 70% of organizations were expected to have a PCard program, up from 60% in 2005. That's a significant growth trend. Also, the growth in transactions between $2,000-$10,000 was 6.1%, which is higher than the lower range. These stats show that PCard adoption is growing, especially in mid-range transactions, which aligns with the A/P conversion mentioned in Passage 1.\n\nAnother stat is that 43% of e-procurement transactions are still paid via check, indicating that while PCard is growing, there's still a reliance on checks. But the trend is towards more PCard usage.\n\nProgrammatic considerations would include things like the controls organizations implement, like purchase limits, MCC restrictions, and regular reviews. Passage 2 mentions these controls in S3-S5. Also, the need for program management and procurement staff to educate suppliers, as mentioned in Passage 1's S32. The challenges here are supplier resistance and surcharges, which are part of the programmatic considerations because organizations have to manage these issues to ensure successful adoption.\n\nThe challenges outlined in the context include supplier resistance (S29, S30, S31), which is a hurdle in adoption. The statistical trends show growth despite these challenges, indicating that the benefits outweigh the issues. The alignment is that even though there are challenges like supplier resistance, the statistical growth and the strategic use in A/P (as per S12, S13) show that organizations are pushing forward with PCard adoption, possibly by addressing these challenges through education and better program management.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the stats from the 2005 survey would cite S15, S16, S17, S18. The growth in transactions and the increase in organizations using PCard programs would be from S18 and the stats in the bullet points. The programmatic aspects like controls and reviews are in S3-S5. The challenges like supplier resistance are in S29-S31 and S32.\n\nI should structure the answer with statements that each have their citations. Need to check each part of the question and ensure all points are covered."
