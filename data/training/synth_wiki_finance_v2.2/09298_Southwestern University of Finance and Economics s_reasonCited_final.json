      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the exits available at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics station and which level they belong to according to the station layout.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided passage. The passage mentions the station's layout in section [S3]. The table under \"Station layout\" has three rows: G, B1, and B2. \n\nLooking at the \"Entrances and Exits\" column, it lists exits A, B, D. The levels here are G, B1, and B2. The question is about exits and their levels. So, exits A, B, D are on the G level. \n\nWait, the table's first column is the level (G, B1, B2), the second is the area (Entrances and Exits, Concourse, Westbound), and the third is the details. So for the G level, the Entrances and Exits are A, B, D. The B1 level is the Concourse, and B2 is the Westbound platform. \n\nSo the exits are A, B, D on the G level. The answer should list those exits and mention they are on the G level. The citations would be from [S3] since that's where the layout is described. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information. The passage doesn't mention other exits. So the statement should be that exits A, B, D are available on the G level, cited from [S3]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific facilities on the concourse level of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics station and which level that corresponds to.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the station's layout. There's a table with different levels: G, B1, B2. The question is about the concourse level. In the table, under the B1 row, the description says \"Concourse\" and lists \"Faregates, Station Agent\". So the concourse is at level B1. The facilities there are faregates and a station agent. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of facilities. The other entries are for exits on G level, and the platforms on B2. So the answer should be that the concourse level (B1) has faregates and a station agent. The citations would be from S3 (since the station layout is under S3) and the specific entries in the table. Wait, the table is part of the passage. The passage's S3 is \"Station layout\" which includes the table. So the information about B1 is in S3. Therefore, the citation for the facilities on the concourse level would be [S3]. Also, the level B1 is part of the same section, so same citation. \n\nI need to structure the answer with two sentences. The first stating the facilities, citing S3. The second stating the level corresponds to B1, also citing S3. Wait, but the question asks for both the facilities and the level. So maybe one sentence each. Let me check the example response format. The example has two sentences, each with their own citations. So here, the first sentence would be about the facilities, citing [S3], and the second sentence about the level, also citing [S3]. But maybe the level is mentioned in the same sentence as the facilities? The user's question is two parts: facilities and which level. So the answer should address both. \n\nSo the answer would be: The concourse level (B1) has faregates and a station agent. The specific facilities are faregates and a station agent. Wait, but the user wants the facilities and the level. So maybe two sentences. Let me make sure. The first sentence: \"The specific facilities present on the concourse level are faregates and a station agent.\" Then the second sentence: \"The concourse level corresponds to B1.\" Both would cite [S3]. \n\nYes, that makes sense. The table in S3 provides both the level (B1) and the facilities there. So both pieces of information are from S3. Therefore, each sentence would have [S3] as the citation."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics station is connected to the university and what evidence from the source supports that.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided passage. The passage starts by mentioning that the station is on Line 4 of the Chengdu Metro. Then, in sentence S2, it says the station serves the nearby Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. That seems like a direct connection. The station's name itself includes the university's name, which is a strong indicator. \n\nLooking at the station layout section, there's a table with entrances and exits, but nothing explicitly stating the connection. However, the fact that the station is named after the university and serves the nearby area suggests that it's intended to provide access to the university. The evidence would be the mention in S2 and the station's name. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that add more info. S3 talks about the station layout, but not the connection. So the main evidence is S2 and the station's name. The answer should state that the station is named after the university and serves the nearby area, citing S2. Also, the station's name itself is part of the evidence, but since the name is in S1, maybe that's also a citation. Wait, S1 is just the station name. The actual connection is in S2. So the answer should cite S2. But the user might also consider the name in S1 as part of the evidence. However, the question asks for evidence from the source, so S1 is the station's name, which is part of the context. But the actual connection is explained in S2. So the answer should mention that the station is named after the university (S1) and serves the nearby university (S2). \n\nWait, the user's question is about how the station is connected to the university. The answer would be that the station is named after the university and serves the nearby area. The evidence would be S1 (the station's name) and S2 (serves the nearby university). So the citations would be [S1][S2]. But I need to check the original passage again. \n\nIn the passage, S1 is \"Southwestern University of Finance and Economics station\" which is the name. Then S2 says \"The station serves the nearby Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.\" So the connection is both the name and the service. Therefore, the answer should cite both S1 and S2. But the user might think that the name is part of the station's identity, so the evidence is S2. However, the question is about the connection, which is established by both the name and the service. So the correct citations would be S1 and S2. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to provide citations of the sentence number. So the answer should have two statements: one stating the station's name (S1) and another stating that it serves the university (S2). But the user's question is asking for how it's connected and the evidence. So the answer would be that the station is connected because it's named after the university (S1) and serves the nearby university (S2). Therefore, the citations would be [S1][S2]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the structural hierarchy of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics station and how its levels are organized according to the layout details.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the station's layout in section S3. The table there lists different levels: G, B1, and B2. \n\nStarting with the structural hierarchy. The station has a G level, which is the ground floor, as it's the first entry. Then B1 is the concourse level, and B2 is the platform level. The user might be referring to these as the different levels. \n\nNext, the organization of the levels. The G level has entrances and exits A, B, D. The B1 level has the concourse with faregates and a station agent. The B2 level has the platforms for westbound and eastbound trains. The platforms are described as an island platform with doors on the left for westbound and eastbound directions. \n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. The station's name is in S1, the serving of the university in S2, and the layout details in S3. The table in S3 provides the specific levels. So each statement about the levels should cite S3. \n\nWait, the user is asking for the structural hierarchy and the organization. So the answer should first state the hierarchy (G, B1, B2) and then explain each level's purpose. Each of these points would be in separate statements with citations. \n\nI should check if there's any other information. The passage doesn't mention other levels, so the answer is based on the given data. Make sure not to add extra information. \n\nSo the answer would be structured as three statements: one for each level, explaining their roles, each citing S3. Also, the initial mention of the station's name and its purpose might need citations, but the question is specifically about the structure and layout. \n\nWait, the question is about the structural hierarchy and how the levels are organized. So the answer should focus on the levels (G, B1, B2) and their layout details. The first sentence could introduce the hierarchy, then each level's description. Each of these sentences would need to cite S3. \n\nI need to make sure that each statement is properly formatted with <statement> and <cite> tags. Also, check that the citations are correctly placed. Since the entire layout is in S3, each part about the levels would cite S3. \n\nSo the final answer would have statements about each level, citing S3 each time. That should cover the user's question accurately."
