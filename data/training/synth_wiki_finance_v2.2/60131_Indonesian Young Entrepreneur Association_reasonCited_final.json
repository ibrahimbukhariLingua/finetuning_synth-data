      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Indonesian Young Entrepreneur Association\n\n\n# Indonesian Young Entrepreneur Association\n\n\n\n**The Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association** (Indonesian: Himpunan Pengusaha Muda Indonesia) abbreviated as **HIPMI**, is an independent, non-partisan organization of young Indonesian entrepreneurs engaged in the economic sector. [S2] The organization was founded on June 10, 1972, by several national entrepreneurs including Drs. [S3] Abdul Latief, Ir. [S4] Siswono Yudo Husodo, Teuku Sjahrul, Datuk Hakim Thantawi, Badar Tando, Drs. [S5] Rudy Kairupan, Irawan Djajaatmadja, SH, Hari Sjamsudin Mangaan, Pontjo Sutowo, and Ir. [S6] Mahdi Diah. [S7] The establishment of this organization was driven by the spirit of fostering entrepreneurship among the youth. [S8] On November 23, 2022, Akbar Buchari was elected as the Chairman of the Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association (term 2022\u20132025), succeeding the previous chairman, Mardani H. [S9] Maming. [S10] ## Organizational Structure\n\nThe organizational structure of HIPMI exists at both the central and regional levels. [S11] HIPMI has established a Central Executive Board (BPP) headquartered in the capital city, Regional Executive Boards based in the provincial capitals, and Branch Executive Boards based in the regency/city capitals. [S12] To date, HIPMI has a presence in 37 provinces in Indonesia and comprises 354 Branch Executive Boards. [S13] In line with regional autonomy and expansion, HIPMI continues to grow to ensure representation throughout Indonesia. [S14] ## Membership\n\nThe organization's regulations establish two types of membership. [S15] Regular Members are those aged 17 \u2013 40 years. [S16] Those who have surpassed the age of 41 are granted the status of Extraordinary Members, commonly referred to as Seniors. [S17] Membership is open to anyone who owns a business. [S18] ## HIPMI University (HIPMI PT)\n\nHIPMI University, established on August 21, 2006, is an autonomous organization initiated by Erwin Aksa, Raja Sapta Oktohari, and Bahlil Lahadalia. [S19] The organization was first inaugurated by Jusuf Kalla, the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia, and Erwin Aksa, Chairman of HIPMI for the 2008\u20132011 period. [S20] As its name suggests, HIPMI PT accepts members who are still undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students. [S21] With the presence of HIPMI PT, it is hoped that students can create job opportunities rather than just seeking employment. [S22] HIPMI initiated this organization due to the high unemployment rate in Indonesia. [S23] The organization observed that a significant portion of the unemployed were educated individuals. [S24] Therefore, university students are trained to become Economic Heroes who can improve the quality of human resources mentally, create jobs, and develop businesses effectively. [S25] The types of businesses run by HIPMI PT members are typically medium-sized enterprises, such as restaurants, cafes, freelance design services, and so on.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the transition from Mardani H. Maming to Akbar Buchari as chairman of HIPMI and how this relates to the historical leadership of the organization.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions that Akbar Buchari was elected as the Chairman in November 2022, succeeding Mardani H. Maming. That's in sentence S8 and S9. The list of chairmen in Passage 2 shows that Mardani H. Maming was the 16th chairman from 2019 to 2022, and Akbar Buchari is the 17th starting in 2022. \n\nNow, the significance of this transition might relate to the historical leadership patterns. Looking at the list of past chairmen, there's a history of prominent entrepreneurs and figures in Indonesia. For example, names like Aburizal Bakrie, who is a well-known businessman, and Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno, who is a politician and entrepreneur. This suggests that HIPMI has been led by influential individuals who have contributed to the business community.\n\nThe transition from Mardani to Akbar Buchari could signify a continuation of this trend, where each leader brings their expertise to foster entrepreneurship. However, the context doesn't provide specific details on why this particular transition is significant. It might be that Akbar Buchari's leadership is expected to carry forward HIPMI's mission, similar to previous leaders. But since the passage doesn't mention specific reasons for the significance, I have to rely on the structural information given.\n\nThe historical leadership part would involve noting that HIPMI has had a series of chairmen who are established entrepreneurs, which the organization's founding goals of promoting youth entrepreneurship. The transition is part of this ongoing legacy. However, without explicit information on the significance, the answer should focus on the factual transition and the historical context of leadership as presented.\n\nSo, the answer should state that the transition marks the succession from Mardani H. Maming to Akbar Buchari in 2022, continuing HIPMI's tradition of having influential leaders. The historical leadership includes notable figures, and this transition is part of that pattern. Citations would be S8, S9, and the list in Passage 2, but since the list is in Passage 2, the specific sentences would be S27 onwards. However, the user's context splits the passage into two parts. The list of chairmen is in Passage 2, so the relevant sentences are S27 to S32. But the exact citations for the transition are S8 and S9. The historical context would reference the list of chairmen, which is in Passage 2, so maybe S27-S32. But the user's instructions say to cite the sentence numbers from the supporting context. The user's passage has S1 to S32. The list of chairmen is in Passage 2, starting at S27. So the transition is mentioned in S8 and S9, and the historical leadership is in the list from S27 onwards. Therefore, the answer would cite S8, S9, and the list entries for the historical context. However, the user might expect that the historical leadership is referenced through the list, but since each entry in the list is a separate sentence, maybe each name is a separate citation. But the user's example shows that citations are [S3][S8], so individual sentences. So, for the historical leadership part, the answer would need to cite the relevant sentences in Passage 2, which are S27 to S32. However, the exact sentence numbers for each chairman might be complex. Alternatively, since the list is in Passage 2, maybe the entire list is considered as part of the context, but the user's format requires specific sentence numbers. The user's passage has S27 as the start of the table, so each row in the table is part of the same sentence? Or each row is a separate sentence? The way the passage is written, the table starts at S27, but the actual sentences might be S27 to S32. However, the exact structure isn't clear. Given that, perhaps the answer should cite S27 (the table's start) and S28-S32 for the specific names. But the user might not have numbered each row. The original passage's Passage 2 has the table starting at S27, and the entries like S28, S29, S30, S31, S32. For example, S28 is \"Maming\" in the list. So the transition from Mardani H. Maming (S28) to Akbar Buchari (S32) is part of the historical leadership. Therefore, the answer would cite S8, S9 for the transition, and S27-S32 for the historical context. But the user's example shows that each sentence is in <statement> tags with their own citations. So the answer should be structured with each statement citing the relevant sentences. The user's question is about the significance of the transition and its relation to historical leadership. The answer would need to mention that the transition is part of HIPMI's history of having prominent leaders, as listed in the table. Therefore, the statements would be: \n\n1. The transition from Mardani H. Maming to Akbar Buchari occurred in 2022, as stated in S8 and S9.\n\n2. The historical leadership of HIPMI includes notable figures, as listed in the table from S27 to S32.\n\nBut the user's answer needs to be in the specified format with <statement> tags and citations. So the final answer would have two statements: one about the transition with citations S8 and S9, and another about the historical leadership with citations from the list. However, since the list is in Passage 2, and the exact sentences are S27 to S32, but the user's context might have each entry as a separate sentence. But given the way the passage is written, the table is in S27, and the entries like S28 (Maming), S29 (Plt.), S30 (Hadi Nainggolan), S31 (Aaron Sampetoding), S32 (Reynaldo Bryan T. Allo). So the historical leadership is referenced through the list, which is in S27-S32. Therefore, the answer would cite those sentences. However, the user might expect that the historical leadership is mentioned in the passage, but the passage only provides the list. So the answer would need to cite the list entries. But the user's instructions say to use the sentence numbers from the supporting context. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The transition from Mardani H. Maming to Akbar Buchari as chairman of HIPMI occurred in 2022, as noted in the passage.<cite>[S8][S9]</cite></statement>\n<statement>This transition aligns with HIPMI's historical pattern of being led by prominent entrepreneurs, as evidenced by the list of past chairmen, including figures like Aburizal Bakrie and Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno, which is detailed in the provided table.<cite>[S27][S28][S29][S30][S31][S32]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if the historical leadership is explicitly mentioned. The passage doesn't have a sentence that directly states the significance, so the answer has to infer based on the list. The user's question is about the significance, which might not be explicitly stated, so the answer has to rely on the context provided. Therefore, the answer would state that the transition is part of the historical leadership structure, citing the list of chairmen."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how HIPMI's membership criteria, specifically the distinction between Regular and Extraordinary Members, supports its mission of fostering entrepreneurship among youth. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The passage mentions that HIPMI was established to foster entrepreneurship among youth. The membership section says Regular Members are aged 17-40, and those over 41 are Extraordinary Members or Seniors. \n\nSo, the age limit for Regular Members is up to 40, which is definitely young adults. This ensures that the organization focuses on younger individuals who are likely to be starting their careers or businesses. By having a clear age range, HIPMI can target programs and resources towards this demographic. \n\nThe Extraordinary Members are those over 41, which might include experienced entrepreneurs. Their inclusion could provide mentorship opportunities, where seniors can guide the younger members. This mentorship would help the youth gain experience and skills, thereby supporting the mission.\n\nAlso, the passage states that membership is open to anyone with a business. This means that both young entrepreneurs and more experienced ones can join, creating a network that fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nI need to check the citations. The relevant sentences are S15 (membership types), S16 (age for Regular), S17 (Extraordinary Members over 41), and S7 (mission to foster entrepreneurship). \n\nSo, the answer should connect the age criteria to targeting youth, and the presence of seniors for mentorship. Each point needs to be cited properly. Let me structure the statements with the correct citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the duration of Akbar Buchari's current leadership term and how it compares to previous chairmen's terms.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the information about Akbar Buchari's term is mentioned. Looking at the supporting context, in Passage 1, sentence S8 says that Akbar Buchari was elected on November 23, 2022, with a term from 2022\u20132025. So the duration is three years. Then, in Passage 2, the table shows his term as 2022 to 2025, which confirms that.\n\nNext, comparing it to previous terms. The table in Passage 2 lists the start and end dates for each chairman. Let's check a few examples. The first chairman, Abdul Latief, served from 1972 to 1973, which is 1 year. Siswono Yudo Husodo from 1973\u20131977, that's 4 years. Aburizal Bakrie 1977\u20131979 (2 years), Pontjo Sutowo 1979\u20131983 (4 years). Later ones like Mardani H. Maming 2019\u20132022 (3 years). So Akbar's term is 3 years, which is similar to some previous terms but not the longest. For example, Siswono and Pontjo had 4-year terms. However, some terms were shorter, like 1 or 2 years. So the answer should state that Akbar's term is 3 years, and note that some previous terms were longer (like 4 years) while others were shorter.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. For Akbar's term, S8 and the table in Passage 2 (S27) are relevant. For the comparison, the table entries for previous chairmen would be cited. For example, Siswono's term is in the table under S27, same with others. Each specific term mentioned in the answer should have the corresponding citation. Since the user wants each sentence to have its own citations, I'll structure the answer accordingly."
