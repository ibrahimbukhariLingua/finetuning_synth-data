      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the European Aviation Network (EAN) in Deutsche Telekom's international operations and how it's structured in terms of partnerships.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions the European Aviation Network under the section with citation [S72]. The relevant sentence says: \"Together with Inmarsat and Nokia, Deutsche Telekom develops a hybrid network for faster internet access on board the planes in Europe. It is a combination of data transmission via Inmarsat Satellite and Deutsche Telekom's LTE ground stations throughout the European continent.\"\n\nSo, the role here is that EAN is a hybrid network developed with Inmarsat and Nokia, providing faster internet on planes in Europe. The structure involves partnerships with Inmarsat and Nokia. The sentence directly states the partners and the collaboration. \n\nI need to check if there are other mentions of EAN elsewhere, but scanning through the passage, that's the only section. The rest of the passage talks about subsidiaries, T-Systems, and Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier, but not EAN. \n\nTherefore, the answer should mention the role as a hybrid network for in-flight internet, developed with Inmarsat and Nokia. The partnerships are with those two companies. The citation is [S72]. \n\nI need to structure the answer into two sentences: one about the role and one about the partnerships, each with the appropriate citations. Wait, the question has two parts: role and structure of partnerships. So maybe two statements. Let me check the format.\n\nThe user's response format requires each sentence in <statement> tags with citations. So the first statement would address the role, and the second the partnerships. But the original sentence in [S72] combines both elements. However, the user might want separate statements. Alternatively, one statement covering both aspects. Let me see.\n\nThe original sentence says EAN is developed with Inmarsat and Nokia, and it's a hybrid network. So the role is the hybrid network for in-flight internet, and the structure is the partnership with Inmarsat and Nokia. So two statements: one about the role, citing [S72], and another about the partnerships, also citing [S72]. But since the sentence is one, maybe it's better to have one statement that covers both aspects. However, the user might want separate points. \n\nBut according to the instructions, each sentence is a separate statement. So if the original sentence has both elements, maybe one statement with the citation. Alternatively, split into two. But the original sentence is a single sentence. So I'll present it as one statement, covering both the role and the partnerships, with the citation [S72]. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that a single sentence can have multiple citations. But in this case, the sentence only has [S72]. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The European Aviation Network (EAN) plays a role in Deutsche Telekom's international operations by developing a hybrid network for faster internet access on board planes in Europe, combining Inmarsat Satellite and Deutsche Telekom's LTE ground stations. [cite][S72]</cite></statement>\n<statement>The EAN is structured through partnerships with Inmarsat and Nokia. [cite][S72]</cite></statement>\n\nBut maybe the first sentence is sufficient, as it includes both the role and the partnerships. However, the question asks for both the role and the structure of partnerships. So splitting into two sentences might be better. However, the original sentence mentions both. So perhaps one statement is enough. But to be thorough, maybe two. However, the user's example shows that a single sentence can have multiple citations, but here the same citation is used. \n\nAlternatively, since the question has two parts, the answer should address each part. So two statements. Let me check the exact wording of the question again: \"What role does the European Aviation Network play... and how is it structured...\" So two separate questions. Therefore, two statements. \n\nBut the supporting context only has one sentence about EAN. So the first statement would answer the role, and the second the partnerships, both citing [S72]. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer would be two statements, each with [S72]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how Deutsche Telekom's ownership structure in the Balkans compares to other regions and the key services of their global divisions.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage has a table with subsidiaries and affiliates. Let me check the countries in the Balkans. The table lists Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. For these, the stakes held by Deutsche Telekom or its affiliates are 39.9%, 52.2%, 76.53%, and 51% respectively. \n\nComparing these to other regions, like Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, etc., most have 100% ownership. For example, Austria's Magenta Telekom is 100% owned. The Balkan countries have lower stakes, often under 52%, except Montenegro at 76.53%. So the ownership structure in the Balkans seems to be more about partial ownership through affiliates rather than full control. \n\nNow, the key services part. The passage mentions T-Systems, which serves medium to large businesses with complex services. Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier offers Voice Termination, Ethernet, IP-Transit, Mobile, Roaming, and In-flight Internet. The European Aviation Network is a joint project with Inmarsat and Nokia for in-flight internet.\n\nI need to structure the answer with citations. For the ownership comparison, cite the relevant rows in the table. For services, cite the sections about T-Systems, Global Carrier, and the Aviation Network. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Check if each sentence is properly attributed. Also, ensure that the answer is accurate and follows the format strictly."

[S2] 'German Telecom'; often just **Telekom**, **DTAG** or **DT**; stylised as **\u00b7T\u00b7**) is a partially state-owned German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn and the largest telecommunications provider in Europe by revenue. [S3] It was formed in 1995 when Deutsche Bundespost, a state monopoly at the time, was privatized. [S4] Since then, Deutsche Telekom has consistently featured among Fortune Magazine's top Global 500 companies by revenue, with its ranking as of 2023\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49 at number 79. [S5] In 2023, the company was ranked 41st in the Forbes Global 2000. [S6] The company operates several subsidiaries worldwide, including the mobile communications brand T-Mobile. [S7] It is the world's fifth-largest telecommunications company and biggest in Europe by revenue. [S8] As of April\u00a02020\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49, the German government held a direct 14.5% stake in company stock and another 17.4% through the government bank KfW. [S9] On 4th June 2024, the German government reduced its total shareholding to 27.8%. [S10] The company is a component of the EURO STOXX 50 stock market index. [S11] ## History\n\nThe Deutsche Bundespost was the German federal government postal administration created in 1947 as a successor to the Reichspost. [S12] It was also the major telephone company in West Germany. [S13] On 1 July 1989, as part of a post office reform, Deutsche Bundespost was split into three entities, one being Deutsche Telekom. [S14] On 1 January 1995, as part of another reform, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom became Deutsche Telekom AG, and was privatized in 1996. [S15] As such, it shares a common heritage with the other privatized Deutsche Bundespost companies, Deutsche Post (DHL) and Deutsche Postbank. [S16] Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly Internet service provider (ISP) for Germany until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. [S17] Until the early 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany, as they were one of the first German telecom units. [S18] On 6 December 2001, Deutsche Telekom became the first official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. [S19] On 1 January 2005, Deutsche Telekom implemented a new company structure. [S20] The two organizational business units of T-Com and T-Online were merged into the Broadband/Fixed Network (BBFN) strategic business unit (T-Online merged with parent Deutsche Telekom in 2006). [S21] It provides around 40 million narrowband lines, over 9 million broadband lines, and has 14 million registered Internet customers. [S22] In 2008, the structure was changed again. [S23] T-Online was separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com to form the new unit T-Home. [S24] In September 2010, Orange parent France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE. [S25] In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH. [S26] This unit now handles all products and services aimed at private customers. [S27] In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their procurement operations and benefiting from economies of scale. [S28] In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their operations in the United States. [S29] In February 2014, Deutsche Telekom acquired the remaining parts of its T-Mobile Czech Republic division for around \u20ac800 million. [S30] The size of the remaining stake was numbered at 40 percent. [S31] In December 2014, it was announced that Deutsche Telekom were in talks with BT Group on the acquisition of EE, and part of the deal was to provide Deutsche Telekom a 12% stake and a seat on the board in the BT Group upon completion. [S32] BT Group announced agreement in February 2015 to acquire EE for \u00a312.5 billion and received regulatory approval from the Competition and Markets Authority on 15 January 2016. [S33] The transaction was completed on 29 January 2016.",

[S3] It was formed in 1995 when Deutsche Bundespost, a state monopoly at the time, was privatized. [S4] Since then, Deutsche Telekom has consistently featured among Fortune Magazine's top Global 500 companies by revenue, with its ranking as of 2023\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49 at number 79.

[S8] As of April\u00a02020\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49, the German government held a direct 14.5% stake in company stock and another 17.4% through the government bank KfW. [S9] On 4th June 2024, the German government reduced its total shareholding to 27.8%. [S10] The company is a component of the EURO STOXX 50 stock market index. [S11] ## History\n\nThe Deutsche Bundespost was the German federal government postal administration created in 1947 as a successor to the Reichspost. [S12] It was also the major telephone company in West Germany. [S13] On 1 July 1989, as part of a post office reform, Deutsche Bundespost was split into three entities, one being Deutsche Telekom. [S14] On 1 January 1995, as part of another reform, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom became Deutsche Telekom AG, and was privatized in 1996. [S15] As such, it shares a common heritage with the other privatized Deutsche Bundespost companies, Deutsche Post (DHL) and Deutsche Postbank. [S16] Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly Internet service provider (ISP) for Germany until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. [S17] Until the early 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany, as they were one of the first German telecom units. [S18] On 6 December 2001, Deutsche Telekom became the first official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. [S19] On 1 January 2005, Deutsche Telekom implemented a new company structure. [S20] The two organizational business units of T-Com and T-Online were merged into the Broadband/Fixed Network (BBFN) strategic business unit (T-Online merged with parent Deutsche Telekom in 2006). [S21] It provides around 40 million narrowband lines, over 9 million broadband lines, and has 14 million registered Internet customers. [S22] In 2008, the structure was changed again. [S23] T-Online was separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com to form the new unit T-Home. [S24] In September 2010, Orange parent France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE. [S25] In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH. [S26] This unit now handles all products and services aimed at private customers. [S27] In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their procurement operations and benefiting from economies of scale. [S28] In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their operations in the United States. [S29] In February 2014, Deutsche Telekom acquired the remaining parts of its T-Mobile Czech Republic division for around \u20ac800 million. [S30] The size of the remaining stake was numbered at 40 percent. [S31] In December 2014, it was announced that Deutsche Telekom were in talks with BT Group on the acquisition of EE, and part of the deal was to provide Deutsche Telekom a 12% stake and a seat on the board in the BT Group upon completion. [S32] BT Group announced agreement in February 2015 to acquire EE for \u00a312.5 billion and received regulatory approval from the Competition and Markets Authority on 15 January 2016.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Deutsche Telekom is involved in blockchain technology and which subsidiaries they operate that are mentioned in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passages to find any mentions of blockchain and subsidiaries.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a sentence [S42] that says, \"In September 2022, Deutsche Telekom is expanding its activities in the field of blockchain technology.\" That's directly about their involvement. Then, [S43] mentions, \"DT\u2019s subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom MMS provides the Ethereum Network with infrastructure in the form of validation nodes.\" So that's a subsidiary involved in blockchain. \n\nNow, for the subsidiaries part. In Passage 1, there's [S49] which states, \"Deutsche Telekom also holds substantial shares in other telecom companies, including Central European subsidiaries Slovak Telekom (Slovakia), Magyar Telekom (Hungary).\" Then [S50] talks about Magyar Telekom holding shares in Makedonski Telekom and Hrvatski Telekom in Crnogorski Telekom. Also, [S51] mentions OTE, Telekom Romania, and Germanos. Additionally, [S52] refers to the wholesale division International Carrier Sales & Solutions (ICSS). \n\nIn Passage 2, [S6] says they operate several subsidiaries worldwide, including T-Mobile. Also, [S7] mentions T-Mobile as a mobile communications brand. There's also [S53] and [S54] about OTE and Telekom Albania, but the user is asking for subsidiaries mentioned in the context. \n\nWait, the question is about subsidiaries that are mentioned. So from the context, the subsidiaries listed are Slovak Telekom, Magyar Telekom, Makedonski Telekom, Hrvatski Telekom, Crnogorski Telekom, OTE, Telekom Romania, Germanos, ICSS, and T-Mobile. Also, Deutsche Telekom MMS is a subsidiary mentioned in [S43]. \n\nBut I need to make sure these are all explicitly mentioned as subsidiaries. For example, [S49] says \"Central European subsidiaries Slovak Telekom (Slovakia), Magyar Telekom (Hungary)\" so those are subsidiaries. Then [S50] mentions Magyar Telekom holds majority shares in Makedonski Telekom and Hrvatski Telekom holds shares in Crnogorski Telekom. So those might be subsidiaries or affiliates. Similarly, [S51] mentions OTE and others. \n\nBut the exact term \"subsidiaries\" is used in [S49] and [S52] for ICSS. Also, [S6] and [S7] mention T-Mobile as a subsidiary. \n\nSo compiling all that, the answer should include the blockchain involvement from [S42] and [S43], and the subsidiaries listed in [S49], [S50], [S51], [S52], [S6], [S7], etc. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement and their citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. Also, check if any other subsidiaries are mentioned. For example, in [S39] and [S40], it's about shares in T-Mobile US, but T-Mobile US is a subsidiary. \n\nWait, [S39] says \"Deutsche Telekom holds up to 43% of its shares\" referring to T-Mobile US. So T-Mobile US is a subsidiary. Also, [S41] mentions T-Mobile Netherlands being sold, so that's a subsidiary. \n\nBut the user is asking for subsidiaries mentioned in the context. So the answer should list all the subsidiaries mentioned, like T-Mobile, Slovak Telekom, Magyar Telekom, Makedonski Telekom, Hrvatski Telekom, Crnogorski Telekom, OTE, Telekom Romania, Germanos, ICSS, and Deutsche Telekom MMS. \n\nBut need to check the exact citations. For example, [S49] mentions Slovak Telekom and Magyar Telekom as subsidiaries. [S50] mentions Magyar Telekom's holdings. [S51] mentions OTE and others. [S52] mentions ICSS as a wholesale division. [S6] and [S7] mention T-Mobile. \n\nSo the answer would have statements about blockchain involvement and the subsidiaries with their respective citations."

[S16] Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly Internet service provider (ISP) for Germany until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. [S17] Until the early 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany, as they were one of the first German telecom units. [S18] On 6 December 2001, Deutsche Telekom became the first official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. [S19] On 1 January 2005, Deutsche Telekom implemented a new company structure. [S20] The two organizational business units of T-Com and T-Online were merged into the Broadband/Fixed Network (BBFN) strategic business unit (T-Online merged with parent Deutsche Telekom in 2006). [S21] It provides around 40 million narrowband lines, over 9 million broadband lines, and has 14 million registered Internet customers. [S22] In 2008, the structure was changed again. [S23] T-Online was separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com to form the new unit T-Home. [S24] In September 2010, Orange parent France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE. [S25] In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH. [S26] This unit now handles all products and services aimed at private customers. [S27] In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their procurement operations and benefiting from economies of scale. [S28] In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their operations in the United States. [S29] In February 2014, Deutsche Telekom acquired the remaining parts of its T-Mobile Czech Republic division for around \u20ac800 million. [S30] The size of the remaining stake was numbered at 40 percent. [S31] In December 2014, it was announced that Deutsche Telekom were in talks with BT Group on the acquisition of EE, and part of the deal was to provide Deutsche Telekom a 12% stake and a seat on the board in the BT Group upon completion. [S32] BT Group announced agreement in February 2015 to acquire EE for \u00a312.5 billion and received regulatory approval from the Competition and Markets Authority on 15 January 2016. [S33] The transaction was completed on 29 January 2016."

The user is asking about Deutsche Telekom's market position in Europe and the initiative they joined in 2020 to address the digital divide.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. Let me scan through the passages. \n\nStarting with the market position. In Passage 2, there's a sentence [S3] that says Deutsche Telekom is the largest telecommunications provider in Europe by revenue. Another sentence [S8] mentions it's the biggest in Europe by revenue. So that's the market position part. \n\nNow, the initiative in 2020. Looking through the passages, in Passage 1, [S37] states that in February 2020, Deutsche Telekom joined the HAPS Alliance to promote high-altitude vehicles to eliminate the digital divide. That seems to be the answer for the initiative.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. Let me check again. The HAPS Alliance initiative is specifically mentioned in [S37]. The market position is covered in [S3] and [S8]. \n\nSo the answer should state that Deutsche Telekom is the largest in Europe by revenue, citing [S3] and [S8], and the HAPS Alliance initiative in 2020 citing [S37]. \n\nI need to structure the response with each statement and their citations.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Deutsche Telekom's stake in Hrvatski Telekom and how it relates to their ownership in other regional subsidiaries, plus the significance of the European Aviation Network partnership.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The main table in Passage 1 lists the subsidiaries and the stakes held by Deutsche Telekom. For Hrvatski Telekom in Croatia, the stake is 52.2%. Then, looking at Bosnia and Herzegovina, it mentions that 39.9% of shares are held by Hrvatski Telekom. Also, Montenegro's Crnogorski Telekom has 76.53% held by Hrvatski Telekom. There's also a note that in North Macedonia, 51% is held by Magyar Telekom, which is another subsidiary. \n\nSo, the stake in Hrvatski Telekom (52.2%) might be part of a broader regional strategy. The question is how this relates to other subsidiaries. The table shows that Deutsche Telekom has varying stakes in different countries, like 100% in Austria, Czech Republic, etc. But Hrvatski Telekom itself has stakes in other companies, like in Bosnia and Montenegro. This suggests that Hrvatski Telekom might act as a regional player, possibly under Deutsche Telekom's umbrella, but the exact relation isn't directly stated. The context doesn't explicitly link the stake in Hrvatski Telekom to other subsidiaries, so I need to be careful not to assume beyond the given data.\n\nFor the second part about the European Aviation Network, the context says that Deutsche Telekom, along with Inmarsat and Nokia, developed a hybrid network combining satellite and LTE. The significance here is the collaboration to provide faster in-flight internet, leveraging both satellite and ground networks. The citation for that is [S72].\n\nNow, structuring the answer. The first part about the stake in Hrvatski Telekom is in [S58]. The related stakes in other subsidiaries are mentioned in [S57] (Bosnia) and [S61] (Montenegro). However, the passage doesn't explicitly state how these are related, so the answer should note that the table shows these stakes but the direct relation isn't detailed. The European Aviation Network's significance is covered in [S72].\n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Also, check that each citation is correctly referenced. The answer should be concise, using the provided data without adding external information."

[S2] 'German Telecom'; often just **Telekom**, **DTAG** or **DT**; stylised as **\u00b7T\u00b7**) is a partially state-owned German telecommunications company headquartered in Bonn and the largest telecommunications provider in Europe by revenue. [S3] It was formed in 1995 when Deutsche Bundespost, a state monopoly at the time, was privatized. [S4] Since then, Deutsche Telekom has consistently featured among Fortune Magazine's top Global 500 companies by revenue, with its ranking as of 2023\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49 at number 79.

[S7] It is the world's fifth-largest telecommunications company and biggest in Europe by revenue. [S8] As of April\u00a02020\u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49, the German government held a direct 14.5% stake in company stock and another 17.4% through the government bank KfW. [S9] On 4th June 2024, the German government reduced its total shareholding to 27.8%. [S10] The company is a component of the EURO STOXX 50 stock market index. [S11] ## History\n\nThe Deutsche Bundespost was the German federal government postal administration created in 1947 as a successor to the Reichspost. [S12] It was also the major telephone company in West Germany. [S13] On 1 July 1989, as part of a post office reform, Deutsche Bundespost was split into three entities, one being Deutsche Telekom. [S14] On 1 January 1995, as part of another reform, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom became Deutsche Telekom AG, and was privatized in 1996. [S15] As such, it shares a common heritage with the other privatized Deutsche Bundespost companies, Deutsche Post (DHL) and Deutsche Postbank.

[S23] T-Online was separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com to form the new unit T-Home. [S24] In September 2010, Orange parent France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE. [S25] In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH. [S26] This unit now handles all products and services aimed at private customers. [S27] In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their procurement operations and benefiting from economies of scale. [S28] In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their operations in the United States.

[S36] Amid concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless networks in Europe, Deutsche Telekom temporarily put all deals to buy 5G network equipment on hold in 2019, as it awaited the resolution of a debate in Germany over whether to ban Chinese vendor Huawei on security grounds. [S37] In February 2020, Deutsche Telekom joined a new partnership called HAPS Alliance to promote the use of high-altitude vehicles in the Earth's stratosphere with the goal of eliminating the digital divide. [S38] On April 1, 2020, Sprint completed the merger with T-Mobile US, making T-Mobile US the owner of Sprint and becoming its subsidiary until the Sprint brand is phased out. [S39] The merger also led SoftBank Group, the then-owner of Sprint, to hold up to 24% of New T-Mobile's shares while Deutsche Telekom holds up to 43% of its shares. [S40] The remaining 33% is since held by public shareholders. [S41] In September 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold T-Mobile Netherlands for \u20ac5.1 billion to the investment companies Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus.

[S52] OTE also used to have shares in One Telecommunications operating in Albania. [S53] Prior to its sale it was known as Telekom Albania using DT's logo and marketing strategies. [S54] Operation of telephone companies involves billing-software or \"BSS\".
