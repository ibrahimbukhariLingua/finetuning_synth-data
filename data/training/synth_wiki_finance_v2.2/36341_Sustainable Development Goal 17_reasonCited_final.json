[S2] SDG 17 refers to the need for the nonhegemonic and fair cross sector and cross country collaborations in pursuit of all the goals by the year 2030. [S3] It is a call for countries to align policies. [S4] SDG 17 is a vision for improved and more equitable trade, as well as coordinated investment initiatives to promote sustainable development across borders. [S5] It is about strengthening and streamlining cooperation between nation-states, both developed and developing, using the SDGs as a shared framework and a shared vision for defining that collaborative way forward. [S6] It seeks to promote international trade and an equitable trading system. [S7] The Goal has 17 targets to be achieved by 2030, broken down into five categories: finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systemic issues. [S8] Progress towards targets will be measured by 25 indicators. [S9] All these targets are regarded as *means of implementation targets*. [S10] With US$5 trillion to $7 trillion in annual investment required to achieve the SDGs, total official development assistance reached US$147.2 billion in 2017. [S11] This, although steady, is below the set target. [S12] In 2016, six countries met the international target to keep official development assistance at or above 0.7 percent of gross national income. [S13] In 2017, international remittances amounted US$613 billion, with 76 percent invested in developing countries. [S14] The bond market for sustainable business is also growing. [S15] In 2018 global green bonds reached US$155.5billion, up to 78 percent from 2017. [S16] Humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters have continued to demand more financial resources and aid. [S17] Even so, many countries also require official development assistance to encourage growth and trade. [S18] The global progress map for SDG 17 shows that significant and major challenges remain in the majority of the world. [S19] Many regions of strong economic status perform very poorly, like the United States and much of Europe. [S20] ## Background\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations to be implemented by the year 2030. [S21] A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. [S22] These inclusive partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared goals that place people and the planet at the center, are needed at the global, regional, national and local level. [S23] Sustainable Goal 17 targets long-term investments to empower sectors and companies in need, more adaptable in developmental countries. [S24] Its main aim reaches improving the following aspects of a country that include: energy, infrastructure, transportation systems, IT infrastructure to different communications technologies channels. [S25] The framework of development covers evaluating and following up with rules and regulations, the sector's structure to attract more investment projects to the country and thus improving its economical standards. [S26] ## Targets, indicators and progress\n\nSDG 17 has 19 targets and 25 indicators. [S27] Below is the list of all the targets with a short version and a long version of the titles.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific roles of custodian agencies in monitoring SDG 17's indicators and how that relates to data availability and geopolitical tensions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions custodian agencies in Passage 2. Let me check there. \n\nIn Passage 2, under the \"Custodian agencies\" section, it lists various indicators and the agencies responsible for them. For example, IMF handles 17.1.1 and 17.1.2, OECD and others handle different indicators. So the role of custodian agencies is to report on these specific indicators. That's a key point.\n\nNext, the question also asks how this relates to data availability and geopolitical tensions. Looking at the \"Challenges\" section in the passage, it mentions that data absence is a challenge (S58). Also, there's a note about geopolitical tensions undermining cooperation (S59). The custodian agencies' role in monitoring would require data collection, which is hindered by data availability issues. Geopolitical tensions might affect the cooperation needed for data sharing or implementation of partnerships, which SDG 17 focuses on.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The custodian agencies are listed in Passage 2, so sentences S55 and the following ones. The data availability issue is mentioned in S28 and S29, where some indicators lack data. Geopolitical tensions are in S58 and S59.\n\nPutting it together: The custodian agencies are responsible for specific indicators, but data gaps (like S28, S29) and geopolitical tensions (S58, S59) pose challenges. So the answer should link the agencies' roles to these challenges."

[S23] Sustainable Goal 17 targets long-term investments to empower sectors and companies in need, more adaptable in developmental countries. [S24] Its main aim reaches improving the following aspects of a country that include: energy, infrastructure, transportation systems, IT infrastructure to different communications technologies channels. [S25] The framework of development covers evaluating and following up with rules and regulations, the sector's structure to attract more investment projects to the country and thus improving its economical standards. [S26] ## Targets, indicators and progress\n\nSDG 17 has 19 targets and 25 indicators. [S27] Below is the list of all the targets with a short version and a long version of the titles. [S28] No data is available yet for the following indicators: 17.5.1, 17.6.1, 17.7.1, 17.13.1, 17.14.1, 17.17.1. [S29] For all the other indicators, data and world maps are available to visualize progress. [S30] ### Target 17.1: Mobilize resources to improve domestic revenue collection",
        "[S55] * Indicator 17.19.1: Dollar value of all resources made available to strengthen statistical capacity in developing countries\n* Indicator 17.19.2: Proportion of countries that (a) have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years; and (b) have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration\n\n### Custodian agencies\n\nCustodian agencies are in charge of reporting on the following indicators:\n\n* Indicator 17.1.1 and 17.1.2: International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n* Indicator 17.2.1 and 17.9.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n* Indicator 17.3.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* Indicator 17.3.2, 17.4.1 and 17.17.1: World Bank (WB)\n* Indicator 17.5.1: UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* Indicator 17.6.1: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS)\n* Indicator 17.6.2: International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* Indicator 17.7.1: United Nations Environmental Programme-Climate Technology Centre and Network (UNEP-CTCN)\n* Indicator for 17.8.1: International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* Indicator 17.10.1, 17.11.1, 17.12.1 and 17.13.1: World Trade Organization (WTO), International Trade Centre (ITC) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* Indicator 17.14.1: United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP)\n* Indicator 17.15.1 and 17.16.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n* Indicator 17.18.1 and 17.19.2: Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA-UNSD)\n* Indicator 17.18.2 and 17.18.3: PARIS 21\n* Indicator 17.19.1: PARIS 23\n\n## Monitoring and progress\n\nHigh-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations Secretary General. [S56] The most recent one is from April 2020. [S57] ## Challenges\n\nChallenges include the absence of data, trade tensions and COVID-19. [S58] In particular, a drastic resurgence in geopolitical tensions and nationalism threatens to undermine cooperation on the SDGs. [S59] ### Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe UN Secretary-General gave a development of strategy that spread out a dream for how the global network can show a powerful, organized reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. [S60] The 2020 Financing for Economical Advancement Report traces measures to address the effect of the unpacked worldwide back down and financial crisis, particularly within the world's poorest nations. [S61] To support the poor communities they also started a UN Reaction and Trust Fund. [S62] Instead, remittances to low income countries are expected to fall and global investment is expected to decline by 40% owing to the pandemic.\u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u02e2 \u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49\n\n\n## Criticism\n\n\n### Partnerships with private finance\n\nThere are concerns that Target 17.17 could undermine the rest of the SDGs. [S63] Indeed, according to a 2018 UN Report, \"in terms of costs, private finance is more expensive than public finance, and public-private partnerships can also incur high design, management and transactional costs due to their complexity and the need for external advice\". [S64] In addition, negotiations of these public-private partnerships can cause project delays of some years. [S65] ## Organizations\n\nThe following United Nations organizations are involved in SDG 17, being custodians of one or several indicators:"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the criticism of Target 17.17 regarding private finance and public-private partnerships aligns with SDG 17's overall goals and the implications for achieving the targets.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what SDG 17 is about. From the passage, SDG 17 is about partnerships for the goals, emphasizing cross-sector and cross-country collaborations. It mentions targets related to finance, technology, capacity building, trade, etc. The overall goal is to strengthen implementation through partnerships.\n\nNow, looking at Target 17.17. The passage mentions that there's criticism that this target could undermine other SDGs. The 2018 UN Report cited says private finance is more expensive than public finance, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) have high costs due to complexity and need for external advice. Also, negotiations can delay projects.\n\nSo, the criticism is that focusing on private finance and PPPs might not be efficient or cost-effective. But SDG 17's goal is to mobilize resources through partnerships, including private sector involvement. The alignment here might be that while the goal encourages partnerships, the criticism points out potential drawbacks. The implications would be that while PPPs are part of the strategy, their high costs and delays could hinder progress towards the targets, especially if they're not managed well.\n\nI need to check the supporting context for specific sentences. The relevant parts are in the \"Criticism\" section under \"Partnerships with private finance\". Sentences S63, S64, S65 mention the concerns. Also, the overall goals of SDG 17 are in S1-S10, S20, etc.\n\nSo the answer should connect the criticism (higher costs, delays) with SDG 17's aim to strengthen partnerships. The implication is that while partnerships are crucial, the challenges with PPPs might affect the effectiveness of achieving the targets, requiring careful management."

The passage mentions that the indicator for this target is the number of countries with mechanisms to enhance policy coherence. Then, there's a statement that policy coherence as per SDGs reproduces technical design logic that's been argued as ineffective or even conducive to incoherent policies. \n\nNext, it says institutional mechanisms can help bridge institutional silos, but centering them as the main criterion for judging policy coherence risks neglecting how sustainable development is transformed. \n\nSo the key points here are that focusing only on institutional mechanisms (like the number of countries with such mechanisms) might not address the actual transformation needed for sustainable development. The limitation is that it's too focused on mechanisms without considering the broader impact. The implication is that this approach might not effectively drive the necessary changes for sustainable development.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with citations. The sentences that discuss the limitation are S48 and S49.

These indicators align with Target 17.11's objective of doubling the least developed countries' share of global exports (S44) by lowering tariff barriers and improving market access. By addressing both global tariff averages (Target 17.10) and specific trade barriers for developing countries (Target 17.12), the indicators collectively aim to create a more equitable trading environment.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the connection between the indicators for Targets 17.10 (multilateral trading system) and 17.12 (trade barriers) and how they align with Target 17.11's goal of increasing exports. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections on different targets. Let me find the parts about 17.10, 17.11, and 17.12.\n\nLooking at Target 17.10: It's about promoting a universal trading system under the WTO. The indicator here is the \"Worldwide weighted tariff-average\" (S43). So, this indicator measures the average tariffs globally, which relates to the multilateral trading system's openness.\n\nTarget 17.12 is about removing trade barriers for least-developed countries. Its indicator is the \"Weighted average tariffs faced by developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States\" (S45). This seems directly related to reducing trade barriers, which would make it easier for these countries to export.\n\nTarget 17.11 aims to increase exports of developing countries, specifically doubling the least developed countries' share by 2020. The indicator here is the \"Developing countries' and least developed countries' share of global exports\" (S44).\n\nNow, the connection between 17.10 and 17.12 with 17.11. Target 17.10's indicator (tariff average) would influence the multilateral trading system's fairness. Lower tariffs (as per 17.10) could make it easier for developing countries to export, aligning with 17.11. Similarly, Target 17.12's focus on removing trade barriers (like tariffs) would directly help increase exports by making markets more accessible. So both 17.10 and 17.12's indicators relate to reducing trade barriers and tariffs, which in turn would help achieve the goal of increasing exports under 17.11.\n\nI need to check the citations. For 17.10, the indicator is cited as [S43], and for 17.12, it's [S45]. The goal of 17.11 is mentioned with [S44]. So the statements should reference these citations. Also, make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with proper citations."

    "[S1] Sustainable Development Goal 17\n\n\n# Sustainable Development Goal 17\n\n\n\n**Sustainable Development Goal 17** (**SDG 17** or **Global Goal 17**) is about \"partnerships for the goals.\" One of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, the official wording is: \"Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\". [S2] SDG 17 refers to the need for the nonhegemonic and fair cross sector and cross country collaborations in pursuit of all the goals by the year 2030. [S3] It is a call for countries to align policies. [S4] SDG 17 is a vision for improved and more equitable trade, as well as coordinated investment initiatives to promote sustainable development across borders. [S5] It is about strengthening and streamlining cooperation between nation-states, both developed and developing, using the SDGs as a shared framework and a shared vision for defining that collaborative way forward. [S6] It seeks to promote international trade and an equitable trading system. [S7] The Goal has 17 targets to be achieved by 2030, broken down into five categories: finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systemic issues. [S8] Progress towards targets will be measured by 25 indicators. [S9] All these targets are regarded as *means of implementation targets*. [S10] With US$5 trillion to $7 trillion in annual investment required to achieve the SDGs, total official development assistance reached US$147.2 billion in 2017. [S11] This, although steady, is below the set target. [S12] In 2016, six countries met the international target to keep official development assistance at or above 0.7 percent of gross national income. [S13] In 2017, international remittances amounted US$613 billion, with 76 percent invested in developing countries. [S14] The bond market for sustainable business is also growing. [S15] In 2018 global green bonds reached US$155.5billion, up to 78 percent from 2017. [S16] Humanitarian crises brought on by conflict or natural disasters have continued to demand more financial resources and aid. [S17] Even so, many countries also require official development assistance to encourage growth and trade. [S18] The global progress map for SDG 17 shows that significant and major challenges remain in the majority of the world. [S19] Many regions of strong economic status perform very poorly, like the United States and much of Europe. [S20] ## Background\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations to be implemented by the year 2030. [S21] A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. [S22] These inclusive partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared goals that place people and the planet at the center, are needed at the global, regional, national and local level. [S23] Sustainable Goal 17 targets long-term investments to empower sectors and companies in need, more adaptable in developmental countries. [S24] Its main aim reaches improving the following aspects of a country that include: energy, infrastructure, transportation systems, IT infrastructure to different communications technologies channels. [S25] The framework of development covers evaluating and following up with rules and regulations, the sector's structure to attract more investment projects to the country and thus improving its economical standards. [S26] ## Targets, indicators and progress\n\nSDG 17 has 19 targets and 25 indicators. [S27] Below is the list of all the targets with a short version and a long version of the titles. [S28] No data is available yet for the following indicators: 17.5.1, 17.6.1, 17.7.1, 17.13.1, 17.14.1, 17.17.1. [S29] For all the other indicators, data and world maps are available to visualize progress. [S30] ### Target 17.1: Mobilize resources to improve domestic revenue collection",

[S36] (this indicator used to be Number 17.6.2)",
    "[S37] In 2020 it was proposed to delete the former Indicator 17.6.1 (Number of science and/or technology cooperation agreements and programmes between countries, by type of cooperation). [S38] ### Target 17.7: Promote sustainable technologies to developing countries\n\nTarget 17.7 is formulated as: \"Promote sustainable technologies to developing countries: Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favorable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed.

[S42] ### Target 17.10: Promote a universal trading system under the WTO\n\nTarget 17.10 is formulated as: \"Promote a universal trading system under the WTO: Promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the world trade organization, including through the conclusion of negotiations under its Doha development agenda.\"\n\nThis target has one Indicator: Indicator 17.10.1 is the \"Worldwide weighted tariff-average\". [S43] ### Target 17.11: Increase the exports of developing countries\n\nTarget 17.11 is formulated as: \"Increase the exports of developing countries: Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with a view to doubling the least developed countries' share of global exports by 2020.\"\n\nThis target has one Indicator: Indicator 17.11.1 is the \"Developing countries' and least developed countries' share of global exports\".

[S47] Policy coherence for sustainable development, as articulated in the SDGs, reproduces the technical design logic and method around building policy coherence that have been argued as ineffective, or worse, conducive to the reproduction of incoherent policies. [S48] Institutional mechanisms can play a constructive role in bridging institutional siloes. [S49] However, centring such mechanisms as *the* criterion by which policy coherence is judged or measured risks neglecting how and whether sustainable development is (trans)formed.

    "[S55] * Indicator 17.19.1: Dollar value of all resources made available to strengthen statistical capacity in developing countries\n* Indicator 17.19.2: Proportion of countries that (a) have conducted at least one population and housing census in the last 10 years; and (b) have achieved 100 per cent birth registration and 80 per cent death registration\n\n### Custodian agencies\n\nCustodian agencies are in charge of reporting on the following indicators:\n\n* Indicator 17.1.1 and 17.1.2: International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n* Indicator 17.2.1 and 17.9.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n* Indicator 17.3.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* Indicator 17.3.2, 17.4.1 and 17.17.1: World Bank (WB)\n* Indicator 17.5.1: UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* Indicator 17.6.1: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS)\n* Indicator 17.6.2: International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* Indicator 17.7.1: United Nations Environmental Programme-Climate Technology Centre and Network (UNEP-CTCN)\n* Indicator for 17.8.1: International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* Indicator 17.10.1, 17.11.1, 17.12.1 and 17.13.1: World Trade Organization (WTO), International Trade Centre (ITC) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* Indicator 17.14.1: United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP)\n* Indicator 17.15.1 and 17.16.1: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n* Indicator 17.18.1 and 17.19.2: Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA-UNSD)\n* Indicator 17.18.2 and 17.18.3: PARIS 21\n* Indicator 17.19.1: PARIS 23\n\n## Monitoring and progress\n\nHigh-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations Secretary General. [S56] The most recent one is from April 2020. [S57] ## Challenges\n\nChallenges include the absence of data, trade tensions and COVID-19. [S58] In particular, a drastic resurgence in geopolitical tensions and nationalism threatens to undermine cooperation on the SDGs. [S59] ### Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe UN Secretary-General gave a development of strategy that spread out a dream for how the global network can show a powerful, organized reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. [S60] The 2020 Financing for Economical Advancement Report traces measures to address the effect of the unpacked worldwide back down and financial crisis, particularly within the world's poorest nations. [S61] To support the poor communities they also started a UN Reaction and Trust Fund. [S62] Instead, remittances to low income countries are expected to fall and global investment is expected to decline by 40% owing to the pandemic.\u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u02e2 \u1d58\u1d56\u1d48\u1d43\u1d57\u1d49\n\n\n## Criticism\n\n\n### Partnerships with private finance\n\nThere are concerns that Target 17.17 could undermine the rest of the SDGs. [S63] Indeed, according to a 2018 UN Report, \"in terms of costs, private finance is more expensive than public finance, and public-private partnerships can also incur high design, management and transactional costs due to their complexity and the need for external advice\". [S64] In addition, negotiations of these public-private partnerships can cause project delays of some years. [S65] ## Organizations\n\nThe following United Nations organizations are involved in SDG 17, being custodians of one or several indicators:",
    "[S66] * International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n* Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n* UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* World Bank (WB)\n* UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNTAD)\n* UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS)\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* United Nations Environmental Programme-Climate Technology Centre and Network (UNEP-CTCN)\n* World Trade Organization (WTO)\n* International Trade Centre (ITC)\n* United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n* United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP)\n* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n* Department of Economic and Social Affairs-Statistics Division (DESA-UNSD)\n* PARIS 21"
