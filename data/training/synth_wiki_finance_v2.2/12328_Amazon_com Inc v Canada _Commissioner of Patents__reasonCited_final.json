[S2] At issue was the patentability of a method that allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying. [S3] ## Background\n\nIn 1998, Amazon.com filed a patent application for a \"Method and System For Placing A Purchase Order Via A Communication Network\". [S4] This invention allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying, which circumvents the process of entering address and billing information in the traditional shopping cart mode of online shopping. [S5] The patent application was rejected by the Commissioner of Patents as non-statutory subject matter. [S6] Following litigation, the Commissioner of Patents issued the patent in December 2011. [S7] ## Judicial History\n\n\n### Commissioner of Patents\n\nIn 2009, the Commissioner of Patents made several findings in its rejection of Amazon.com's patent application. [S8] First, it noted that both the form and substance of the claim must be evaluated. [S9] Form refers to the text of the claim and understanding the claim based on the text alone. [S10] Substance connotes the nature of the invention in question and what it adds to human knowledge. [S11] The Commissioner noted that the substance of the invention, defined by its new and inventive features, must fall within one of the statutory categories of invention found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S12] Applying this approach to the facts, the Commissioner found that, although Amazon.com's claim, on the fact of its text, was directed towards a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter, the Commissioner found that the substance of all its claims were directed to streamlining the process of sales and reaping benefits flowing from it, and therefore constituted a \"business method\". [S13] In *Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser*, Justice Arbour, in dissent, had listed a number of examples where courts had excluded subject matter from patentability, including (incorrectly) \"business systems and methods\". [S14] The Commissioner relied on Justice Arbour's observation to find that business methods had no historical basis of patentability in Canada, and were therefore *per se* unpatentable. [S15] No definition of \"business method\" was supplied by the Commissioner. [S16] In considering whether business methods could fall under the statutory category of an \"art\", the Commissioner found that all five statutory categories of invention were technological in nature. [S17] It concluded that an \"art\" that is not technological cannot be a statutory subject matter. [S18] The Commissioner dismissed that the Amazon.com's invention provided any technological benefits and advances because Amazon.com's decision to proceed with one-click shopping with business in nature and yielded only a \"convenience advantage\". [S19] Amazon.com proceed to commence an appeal of the Commissioner's decision at the Federal Court of Canada in 2010. [S20] ### Federal Court of Canada\n\nPassage 2:\n[S21] At the Federal Court, Justice Phelan decisively quashed the Commissioner's decision. [S22] First, the Court found that the \"form and substance\" formulation and analysis of Amazon.com's claims departed from the approach articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Free World Trust v \u00c9lectro Sant\u00e9 Inc* and *Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc*, which stated that the identification of the invention must be done through a purposive construction of its claims. [S23] Second, the Court found that the \"technological\" requirement was too restrictive in the test for an \"art\". [S24] The Court could find nothing in Canadian jurisprudence which would support such a requirement. [S25] Third, Justice Phelan concluded that there was no \"tradition\" for the categorical exclusion of \"business methods\" from patentability in Canada. [S26] Instead, the Court states that business methods were to be assessed pursuant to the five categories found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S27] The Court then went on to consider the claims and find that a purposive construction of Amazon.com's claims disclosed a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter under section 2 of the *Patent Act*, which implemented something more than just a \"mathematical formula\". [S28] Given this characterization of Amazon.com's claims and its rejection of the Commissioner's decision, the Court sent the case back to the Commissioner with the direction that the claims constitute patentable subject matter. [S29] The Commissioner of Patents then appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, which released its decision in late 2011. [S30] ## Ruling\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal essentially agreed with the three criticisms the Federal Court offered for the Commissioner's decision. [S31] The Court, however, also added that \"it does not necessarily follow\u2026that a business method that is not itself patentable subject matter because it is an abstract idea becomes patentable subject matter merely because it has a practical embodiment or a practical application. [S32] In my view, this cannot be a distinguishing test, because it is axiomatic that a business method always has or is intended to have a practical application.\" Thus, the Court of Appeal did not affirm Justice Phelan's finding that Amazon.com's claims constituted patentable subject matter. [S33] Instead, it noted that Amazon.com's claim may still fail if, per *Schlumberger Canada Ltd v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)*, the only novel aspect of the claimed invention was the business method and the business method was interpreted as a \"mere scientific principle or abstract theorem\", which cannot be the subject matter of an invention according to section 27(8) of the *Patent Act*, mentioned above. [S34] Despite agreeing with most of the substance of the Federal Court's judgement, Justice Sharlow, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal, found that it was inappropriate for Justice Phelan to pursue his own purposive construction of the claims advanced by Amazon.com. [S35] Purposive construction must be executed with a foundation of knowledge about the relevant art. [S36] Justice Phelan did not have expert evidence before the Federal Court from persons skilled in the art, and therefore it would have been more appropriate for the Commissioner to re-examine the claims, given the expertise of the Patent Office. [S37] Accordingly, the Federal Court of Appeal remanded the application to the Commissioner for expedited reconsideration. [S38] ## Aftermath\n\nThe Commissioner of Patents issued the patent in December 2011. [S39] Later, on March 8, 2012, the Canadian Patent Office announced changes in patent examination practice based on the ruling in the Amazon.com case. [S40] CIPO published new guidelines for determining whether an invention constitutes statutory subject matter based on a purposive construction of the claims. [S41] Updated guidance on examination practice for computer-related inventions was also published at the same time.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key criticisms of the Commissioner of Patents' decision by the Federal Court and how the Court of Appeal's ruling addressed those criticisms regarding Amazon's one-click method.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage is divided into two parts. Let me start by identifying the relevant sections.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a section titled \"Commissioner of Patents\" with several sentences. Specifically, [S8] mentions the Commissioner's findings. The key points here are that the Commissioner evaluated both the form and substance of the claim. They considered form as the text of the claim and substance as the nature of the invention. The Commissioner concluded that the invention was a business method, which they deemed unpatentable per se, citing Justice Arbour's dissent in Monsanto. Also, they didn't define \"business method\" and thought that business methods aren't technological, hence not patentable under section 2.\n\nThen, in Passage 2, the Federal Court's decision is discussed. The Federal Court criticized the Commissioner's approach. For example, [S22] says the Court found the \"form and substance\" approach departed from the Supreme Court's precedent. [S23] mentions that the technological requirement was too restrictive. [S25] states there's no jurisprudence supporting the technological requirement. [S26] notes there's no tradition of excluding business methods. The Court also found that the claims were a \"machine,\" which is patentable.\n\nNow, the Federal Court of Appeal's ruling is in [S31] to [S38]. The Court agreed with the Federal Court's three criticisms but added that a business method isn't automatically patentable just because it has a practical application. They referenced the Schlumberger case, saying if the novel aspect is a business method as an abstract idea, it's not patentable under section 27(8). Also, they criticized Justice Phelan for not using expert evidence, so they remanded the case back to the Commissioner.\n\nSo, the key criticisms by the Federal Court were: 1) The Commissioner's \"form and substance\" approach didn't align with Supreme Court precedents. 2) The technological requirement was too strict. 3) No tradition of excluding business methods. The Court of Appeal agreed with these but added that practical application isn't enough, and they wanted the Commissioner to re-examine with proper expertise.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Each sentence in the answer should have its citations. Let me check the sentence numbers again to make sure I'm accurate. For example, the Commissioner's criticisms are in [S8]-[S18], and the Federal Court's criticisms are [S22]-[S27]. The Court of Appeal's points are [S31]-[S34], [S36]-[S38].\n\nI need to make sure each statement in the answer is properly cited. Also, the user wants the answer in the specified format with <statement> and <cite> tags. Let me draft the answer accordingly."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the Federal Court of Appeal's decision to remand the case to the Commissioner and how that relates to the use of purposive construction in patent claim analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections: the background of the case and the judicial history, including the Federal Court of Canada's ruling and the Federal Court of Appeal's decision.\n\nStarting with the significance of remanding the case. From the context, the Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the Federal Court's criticisms of the Commissioner's decision but didn't affirm the finding that Amazon's claims were patentable. Instead, they sent it back to the Commissioner. The reason given is that the Federal Court's purposive construction lacked expert evidence from those skilled in the art, so the Commissioner should re-examine it. So the significance is that the Court wanted the Commissioner to handle it again with proper expertise, implying that the initial analysis was incomplete.\n\nNow, how does this relate to purposive construction? The Federal Court had used purposive construction, which the Court of Appeal partially agreed with but pointed out the need for expert evidence. The Court of Appeal emphasized that purposive construction requires a foundation in the relevant art, which the lower court didn't have. Therefore, remanding was necessary to ensure proper application of the purposive construction method.\n\nLooking for specific citations. The part about remanding is in S38. The discussion about purposive construction is in S35 and S36. Also, the Court of Appeal's point about the need for expert evidence is in S36 and S37. The part where they mention that the Federal Court didn't have expert evidence is in S36. \n\nSo the answer should mention that the remand was because the Federal Court's purposive construction lacked expert evidence, so the Commissioner should re-examine. The significance is that it highlights the necessity of expert input in purposive construction, ensuring that the analysis is done by those with the relevant expertise. The citations would be S35, S36, S37, and S38."

[S2] At issue was the patentability of a method that allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying. [S3] ## Background\n\nIn 1998, Amazon.com filed a patent application for a \"Method and System For Placing A Purchase Order Via A Communication Network\". [S4] This invention allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying, which circumvents the process of entering address and billing information in the traditional shopping cart mode of online shopping. [S5] The patent application was rejected by the Commissioner of Patents as non-statutory subject matter. [S6] Following litigation, the Commissioner of Patents issued the patent in December 2011. [S7] ## Judicial History\n\n\n### Commissioner of Patents\n\nIn 2009, the Commissioner of Patents made several findings in its rejection of Amazon.com's patent application. [S8] First, it noted that both the form and substance of the claim must be evaluated. [S9] Form refers to the text of the claim and understanding the claim based on the text alone. [S10] Substance connotes the nature of the invention in question and what it adds to human knowledge. [S11] The Commissioner noted that the substance of the invention, defined by its new and inventive features, must fall within one of the statutory categories of invention found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S12] Applying this approach to the facts, the Commissioner found that, although Amazon.com's claim, on the fact of its text, was directed towards a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter, the Commissioner found that the substance of all its claims were directed to streamlining the process of sales and reaping benefits flowing from it, and therefore constituted a \"business method\". [S13] In *Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser*, Justice Arbour, in dissent, had listed a number of examples where courts had excluded subject matter from patentability, including (incorrectly) \"business systems and methods\". [S14] The Commissioner relied on Justice Arbour's observation to find that business methods had no historical basis of patentability in Canada, and were therefore *per se* unpatentable. [S15] No definition of \"business method\" was supplied by the Commissioner. [S16] In considering whether business methods could fall under the statutory category of an \"art\", the Commissioner found that all five statutory categories of invention were technological in nature. [S17] It concluded that an \"art\" that is not technological cannot be a statutory subject matter. [S18] The Commissioner dismissed that the Amazon.com's invention provided any technological benefits and advances because Amazon.com's decision to proceed with one-click shopping with business in nature and yielded only a \"convenience advantage\".

[S22] First, the Court found that the \"form and substance\" formulation and analysis of Amazon.com's claims departed from the approach articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Free World Trust v \u00c9lectro Sant\u00e9 Inc* and *Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc*, which stated that the identification of the invention must be done through a purposive construction of its claims. [S23] Second, the Court found that the \"technological\" requirement was too restrictive in the test for an \"art\". [S24] The Court could find nothing in Canadian jurisprudence which would support such a requirement. [S25] Third, Justice Phelan concluded that there was no \"tradition\" for the categorical exclusion of \"business methods\" from patentability in Canada. [S26] Instead, the Court states that business methods were to be assessed pursuant to the five categories found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S27] The Court then went on to consider the claims and find that a purposive construction of Amazon.com's claims disclosed a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter under section 2 of the *Patent Act*, which implemented something more than just a \"mathematical formula\". [S28] Given this characterization of Amazon.com's claims and its rejection of the Commissioner's decision, the Court sent the case back to the Commissioner with the direction that the claims constitute patentable subject matter. [S29] The Commissioner of Patents then appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, which released its decision in late 2011. [S30] ## Ruling\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal essentially agreed with the three criticisms the Federal Court offered for the Commissioner's decision. [S31] The Court, however, also added that \"it does not necessarily follow\u2026that a business method that is not itself patentable subject matter because it is an abstract idea becomes patentable subject matter merely because it has a practical embodiment or a practical application. [S32] In my view, this cannot be a distinguishing test, because it is axiomatic that a business method always has or is intended to have a practical application.\" Thus, the Court of Appeal did not affirm Justice Phelan's finding that Amazon.com's claims constituted patentable subject matter. [S33] Instead, it noted that Amazon.com's claim may still fail if, per *Schlumberger Canada Ltd v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)*, the only novel aspect of the claimed invention was the business method and the business method was interpreted as a \"mere scientific principle or abstract theorem\", which cannot be the subject matter of an invention according to section 27(8) of the *Patent Act*, mentioned above.

[S31] The Court, however, also added that \"it does not necessarily follow\u2026that a business method that is not itself patentable subject matter because it is an abstract idea becomes patentable subject matter merely because it has a practical embodiment or a practical application. [S32] In my view, this cannot be a distinguishing test, because it is axiomatic that a business method always has or is intended to have a practical application.\" Thus, the Court of Appeal did not affirm Justice Phelan's finding that Amazon.com's claims constituted patentable subject matter. [S33] Instead, it noted that Amazon.com's claim may still fail if, per *Schlumberger Canada Ltd v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)*, the only novel aspect of the claimed invention was the business method and the business method was interpreted as a \"mere scientific principle or abstract theorem\", which cannot be the subject matter of an invention according to section 27(8) of the *Patent Act*, mentioned above. [S34] Despite agreeing with most of the substance of the Federal Court's judgement, Justice Sharlow, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal, found that it was inappropriate for Justice Phelan to pursue his own purposive construction of the claims advanced by Amazon.com. [S35] Purposive construction must be executed with a foundation of knowledge about the relevant art. [S36] Justice Phelan did not have expert evidence before the Federal Court from persons skilled in the art, and therefore it would have been more appropriate for the Commissioner to re-examine the claims, given the expertise of the Patent Office. [S37] Accordingly, the Federal Court of Appeal remanded the application to the Commissioner for expedited reconsideration. [S38] ## Aftermath\n\nThe Commissioner of Patents issued the patent in December 2011. [S39] Later, on March 8, 2012, the Canadian Patent Office announced changes in patent examination practice based on the ruling in the Amazon.com case. [S40] CIPO published new guidelines for determining whether an invention constitutes statutory subject matter based on a purposive construction of the claims. [S41] Updated guidance on examination practice for computer-related inventions was also published at the same time."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking why the Commissioner of Patents initially rejected Amazon's patent application and how the Federal Court's analysis challenged that reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections. Let me start by finding the parts where the Commissioner's rejection is discussed. \n\nLooking at the \"Background\" section, [S5] mentions that the patent application was rejected by the Commissioner as non-statutory subject matter. Then, in the \"Commissioner of Patents\" subsection, there's more detail. [S12] says the Commissioner required the substance of the invention to fall within statutory categories. [S13] explains that the Commissioner considered the invention a business method, which they deemed unpatentable. [S14] and [S15] mention relying on a previous case where business methods were excluded, and [S17] and [S18] state that the Commissioner thought \"art\" must be technological. Also, [S19] notes they dismissed technological benefits, calling it a convenience advantage.\n\nSo the reasons for rejection are: business method not patentable, no technological aspect, and convenience advantage not sufficient. \n\nNow, the Federal Court's analysis. In the \"Federal Court of Canada\" section, [S22] says the Court quashed the Commissioner's decision. [S23] mentions the Court found the \"form and substance\" approach departed from the Supreme Court's purposive construction. [S24] and [S25] state the Court rejected the technological requirement for \"art\". [S26] says there's no tradition of excluding business methods, so they should be assessed under the five categories. [S27] mentions the Court found the claims disclosed a \"machine\", patentable under section 2. \n\nThe Federal Court challenged the Commissioner's reasoning by rejecting the strict technological requirement, questioning the exclusion of business methods, and using a purposive construction of the claims. \n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal's ruling in [S31] agreed with some points but didn't fully affirm the Federal Court's conclusion. They mentioned that practical application isn't the test and that the Commissioner should re-examine due to lack of expert evidence. \n\nSo putting it all together, the Commissioner rejected it because they saw it as a business method without technological aspects. The Federal Court challenged this by arguing that business methods should be evaluated under the statutory categories, not excluded categorically, and that the technological requirement wasn't supported by law. They also used a different method of claim construction. \n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. For the rejection reasons, citations would be [S5][S12][S13][S14][S15][S17][S18][S19]. For the Federal Court's challenge, [S22][S23][S24][S25][S26][S27]. The Court of Appeal's part might be [S31][S32][S33][S34][S35][S36][S37][S38], but the question specifically asks about the Federal Court's analysis, so maybe focus on the Federal Court's part. Wait, the question says \"Federal Court's analysis challenge this reasoning\". The Federal Court of Canada's analysis is in Passage 2. The Court of Appeal's part is later, but the user might be referring to the Federal Court's decision. \n\nSo the answer should first explain the Commissioner's reasons with the relevant citations, then the Federal Court's challenges with their citations. Make sure each sentence has the correct citations."

    "[S1] Amazon.com Inc v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)\n\n\n# Amazon.com Inc v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)\n\n\n\n***Amazon.com Inc v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)*** is a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal concerning the patentability of business methods within the context of the Patent Act. [S2] At issue was the patentability of a method that allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying. [S3] ## Background\n\nIn 1998, Amazon.com filed a patent application for a \"Method and System For Placing A Purchase Order Via A Communication Network\". [S4] This invention allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying, which circumvents the process of entering address and billing information in the traditional shopping cart mode of online shopping. [S5] The patent application was rejected by the Commissioner of Patents as non-statutory subject matter. [S6] Following litigation, the Commissioner of Patents issued the patent in December 2011. [S7] ## Judicial History\n\n\n### Commissioner of Patents\n\nIn 2009, the Commissioner of Patents made several findings in its rejection of Amazon.com's patent application. [S8] First, it noted that both the form and substance of the claim must be evaluated. [S9] Form refers to the text of the claim and understanding the claim based on the text alone. [S10] Substance connotes the nature of the invention in question and what it adds to human knowledge. [S11] The Commissioner noted that the substance of the invention, defined by its new and inventive features, must fall within one of the statutory categories of invention found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S12] Applying this approach to the facts, the Commissioner found that, although Amazon.com's claim, on the fact of its text, was directed towards a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter, the Commissioner found that the substance of all its claims were directed to streamlining the process of sales and reaping benefits flowing from it, and therefore constituted a \"business method\". [S13] In *Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser*, Justice Arbour, in dissent, had listed a number of examples where courts had excluded subject matter from patentability, including (incorrectly) \"business systems and methods\". [S14] The Commissioner relied on Justice Arbour's observation to find that business methods had no historical basis of patentability in Canada, and were therefore *per se* unpatentable. [S15] No definition of \"business method\" was supplied by the Commissioner. [S16] In considering whether business methods could fall under the statutory category of an \"art\", the Commissioner found that all five statutory categories of invention were technological in nature. [S17] It concluded that an \"art\" that is not technological cannot be a statutory subject matter. [S18] The Commissioner dismissed that the Amazon.com's invention provided any technological benefits and advances because Amazon.com's decision to proceed with one-click shopping with business in nature and yielded only a \"convenience advantage\". [S19] Amazon.com proceed to commence an appeal of the Commissioner's decision at the Federal Court of Canada in 2010. [S20] ### Federal Court of Canada",
    "[S21] At the Federal Court, Justice Phelan decisively quashed the Commissioner's decision. [S22] First, the Court found that the \"form and substance\" formulation and analysis of Amazon.com's claims departed from the approach articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Free World Trust v \u00c9lectro Sant\u00e9 Inc* and *Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc*, which stated that the identification of the invention must be done through a purposive construction of its claims. [S23] Second, the Court found that the \"technological\" requirement was too restrictive in the test for an \"art\". [S24] The Court could find nothing in Canadian jurisprudence which would support such a requirement. [S25] Third, Justice Phelan concluded that there was no \"tradition\" for the categorical exclusion of \"business methods\" from patentability in Canada. [S26] Instead, the Court states that business methods were to be assessed pursuant to the five categories found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S27] The Court then went on to consider the claims and find that a purposive construction of Amazon.com's claims disclosed a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter under section 2 of the *Patent Act*, which implemented something more than just a \"mathematical formula\". [S28] Given this characterization of Amazon.com's claims and its rejection of the Commissioner's decision, the Court sent the case back to the Commissioner with the direction that the claims constitute patentable subject matter. [S29] The Commissioner of Patents then appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, which released its decision in late 2011. [S30] ## Ruling\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal essentially agreed with the three criticisms the Federal Court offered for the Commissioner's decision. [S31] The Court, however, also added that \"it does not necessarily follow\u2026that a business method that is not itself patentable subject matter because it is an abstract idea becomes patentable subject matter merely because it has a practical embodiment or a practical application.
