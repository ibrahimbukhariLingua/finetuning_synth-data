      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the Pensions Regulator's 2013 campaign addressed pension liberation and the consequences of such schemes.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage for information about the 2013 campaign. Scanning through, I see in the \"Consequences of Pension liberation\" section that there's a sentence mentioning the Pensions Regulator's campaign. Specifically, [S9] says that between 2013 and 2014, money lost increased by 18%, and then [S10] states that a campaign started in February 2013 led to frozen assets in 20 schemes, suspension of 18 websites, and seven arrests. So that's the answer for the first part.\n\nNext, the consequences on individuals. The passage mentions financial ruin and suicides. [S11] directly states that pension liberation can lead to financial ruin and suicides. Then [S12] gives an example of a 40-year-old man who committed suicide after not getting the promised \u00a317k. Also, the tax and fees structure in [S6][S7], and [S8] show the financial impact, but the question specifically asks about the reported consequences, which includes the suicides and financial issues. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The campaign's actions are in [S10], and the consequences are [S11] and [S12]. The tax details are part of the costs but maybe not the \"consequences on individuals\" as directly as the financial ruin and suicides. So the answer should include the campaign's actions (frozen assets, suspended sites, arrests) and the consequences (financial ruin, suicides). \n\nCheck if there's any other info. The user might also want to know if the campaign had any effect, but the question is about how the campaign addressed it and the consequences. The answer should be structured into two parts: the campaign's measures and the consequences. Each part with the relevant citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific financial losses in the example breakdown of pension liberation and how taxes and fees contribute to the reduced amount received by the pension holder.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions a table with an example breakdown. Let me check the sentences related to that. \n\nLooking at the passage, sentence S8 mentions the example breakdown. The table shows the costs and charges. The \"Money 'liberated'\" is \u00a320,000. Then there's a tax charge of 55% which is \u00a311,000, leaving \u00a39,000. The scheme fee is 20% (\u00a34,000), but then there's a tax on the scheme fee at 55% (\u00a32,200), leaving \u00a32,800. The total of these charges is \u00a317,200, so the pension holder ends up with \u00a32,800.\n\nSo the specific financial losses are the 55% tax on the liberated money, the 20% scheme fee, and the 55% tax on the fee. The taxes and fees reduce the amount by taking \u00a311,000 (tax), \u00a34,000 (fee), and \u00a32,200 (tax on fee), totaling \u00a317,200 deducted from the original \u00a320,000, leaving \u00a32,800.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The example breakdown is in S8. The tax charge is mentioned in S6 and S7. The scheme fee is in S6. The tax on the fee is in S7. So the sentences to cite would be S6, S7, and S8. Wait, the table itself is in S8, but the details about the taxes and fees are in S6 and S7. So the example breakdown's numbers are in S8, but the explanation of the taxes and fees are in S6 and S7. Therefore, the answer should reference S6, S7, and S8.\n\nSo the statement would explain the specific losses as the 55% tax, 20% fee, and 55% tax on the fee, citing S6, S7, and S8. The contribution of taxes and fees is explained in those same sentences."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the measures the FCA recommends to prevent pension liberation scams and how these align with the risks. First, I need to look through the provided passage to find any mentions of the FCA's recommendations.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section titled \"Consequences of Pension liberation\" and under that, sentence S14 says: \"The Financial Conduct Authority warns against cold-calling scams and it is advised to only work with a company registered on the FCA's list of regulated companies.\" That seems like a key point. So the FCA's measure here is warning against cold-calling and advising to use registered companies.\n\nNow, how does this align with the risks? The passage mentions that scammers use cold calls (S13) and that pension liberation leads to high risks like tax charges, fees, and financial ruin (S6, S7, S11). By warning against cold calls, the FCA is addressing the method scammers use to lure people. Advising to use registered companies would mitigate the risk of falling for unregulated schemes, which are high risk (S4). \n\nI need to check if there are other FCA-related measures. The passage doesn't mention other specific measures, so S14 is the main one. The alignment is that the FCA's advice targets the tactics used by scammers (cold calls) and the lack of regulation, which are key risks. The citations would be S14 for the FCA's measures and S13 for the cold calling method, and S4 for the risks of unregulated overseas funds. Also, the tax and fee risks (S6, S7) are addressed by the FCA's advice to avoid unregulated schemes. But the question specifically asks about the measures and their alignment with risks. So the answer should link the FCA's recommendations to the specific risks mentioned."

    "[S1] Pension liberation\n\n\n# Pension liberation\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, **pension liberation** is a term used by confidence tricksters that purports to allow individuals to access the funds within a pension before the age of 55 when permission has not been provided by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). [S2] ## Background\n\nExcept in rare circumstances, such as terminal illness, pensions can only be legally accessed from the age of 55, and most opportunities to do so earlier are scams. [S3] Scammers use confusion with pension release to convince the unsuspecting that there is a legal loophole that allows them to access the money, but the High Court ruled in May 2014 that no such loophole exists. [S4] \"Liberated\" money is typically placed into overseas funds, which are high risk with little to no regulation. [S5] Pension liberation carries large costs. [S6] HMRC imposes a 55% tax charge on any money released, and the scheme could have very high fees in excess of 20%. [S7] HMRC also charges a further 55% tax on the scheme's fee. [S8] The table below gives an example breakdown of the tax and fees, demonstrating how little the pension holder receives:\n\n| Example breakdown of the tax and fees | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Costs and charges | Sum remaining | | | |\n| **Money \"liberated\"** | \u00a320,000 | \u00a320,000 | | | |\n| **Tax charge** | 55% | \u00a311,000 | \u00a39,000 | | | |\n| **Scheme fee** | 20% | \u00a34000 | \u00a35,000 | | | |\n| **Tax on scheme fee** | 55% | \u00a32,200 | \u00a32,800 | | | |\n| **Total** | \u00a317,200 | \u00a32,800 |\n\n\n## Consequences of Pension liberation\n\nBetween the end of 2013 and July 2014, the amount of money lost to liberation schemes increased 18%. [S9] A campaign started by the Pensions Regulator in February 2013 led to frozen assets in 20 schemes, the suspension of 18 pension liberation websites and seven arrests. [S10] Pension liberation can leave people in financial ruin, and suicides have been reported as a result. [S11] The Financial Times reported the suicide a 40-year-old man who did not receive the \u00a317,000 lump sum promised to him from a liberation scheme. [S12] Pension liberation operators may use website promotions, cold calls or text messages to encourage people to access their pension before 55. [S13] The Financial Conduct Authority warns against cold-calling scams and it is advised to only work with a company registered on the FCA's list of regulated companies. [S14] ## Differences with Pension Release\n\nPension release is when a person removes money from their pension once they are 55 or older. [S15] As of 2015 UK law allows up to 25% of a defined contribution pension to be released tax free from the age of 55. [S16] People can be tricked into a pension liberation scam if they are unaware that they cannot access their pension at a younger age. [S17] The remainder of the fund stays invested until the individual decides to start drawing an income from it. [S18] Between April 2014 and April 2015 funds not exceeding \u00a330,000 can be taken in their entirety, but from April 2015, restrictions on how much money is removed from a pension fund will be lifted, and a marginal rate of tax will be applied to withdrawals. [S19] The age limit of 55 will remain."
