      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key investment focuses of Scipion Capital's different funds and how they align with the company's overall strategy. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions several funds: Scipion African Opportunities Fund, Scipion Active Trading Fund, Scipion Term Loan Fund, and Scipion Active Impact Fund. Each has its own focus.\n\nStarting with the first fund, the Scipion African Opportunities Fund, launched in 2007, it's for commodity trade finance, providing short-term loans for non-perishable commodities. That's under S4 and S5. Then the Scipion Active Trading Fund in 2010 is a lending platform for allocating investments between different participants. That's S6 and S7. The Term Loan Fund from 2017 is asset-backed loans to emerging markets, 1-5 year loans with USD revenue streams (S8 and S9). The Active Impact Fund in 2018 focuses on responsible investing with ESG criteria (S10).\n\nNow, the overall strategy of Scipion Capital is mentioned in the first sentences. They are a London-based hedge fund specializing in private debt (S1), located in Mayfair (S2), founded by Nicolas Clavel in 2007 (S3). The investments section shows they have various funds targeting different areas: trade finance, lending platforms, emerging markets, and impact investing. \n\nThe key investment focuses are commodity trade finance, asset-backed loans, and responsible investing. The alignment with the overall strategy would be their specialization in private debt, targeting emerging markets, and incorporating ESG factors. The Active Impact Fund's focus on ESG aligns with responsible investing, which might be part of their broader strategy. The Term Loan Fund's focus on emerging markets and asset-backed loans fits into their private debt specialization. The Active Trading Fund's role in facilitating investments could be part of their strategy to manage and allocate capital effectively.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the African Opportunities Fund's focus is cited from S4 and S5. The Active Trading Fund from S6 and S7. The Term Loan Fund from S8 and S9. The Active Impact Fund from S10. The overall strategy mentions their specialization in private debt (S1), location (S2), and founding (S3). \n\nI should structure each sentence with the correct citations. Also, check if any sentences need multiple citations. For instance, the part about the Term Loan Fund participating in 1-5 year loans is S8 and S9. The Active Impact Fund's ESG criteria is S10. \n\nMake sure not to miss any funds and their respective details. Also, ensure that the alignment with the overall strategy is covered by referencing the general information about the company's specialization and structure."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Nicolas Clavel's role in establishing Scipion Capital and the funds launched under his leadership in specific years.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The key sentences here are S1 to S10. Let me go through each one.\n\nStarting with S3: \"It was founded by Nicolas Clavel in 2007.\" That directly answers his role as the founder. So that's one part of the answer. \n\nNext, the question mentions the funds launched under his leadership. The passage lists several funds. The first is the Scipion African Opportunities Fund launched in 2007 (S4). Then the Scipion Active Trading Fund in 2010 (S6). The Scipion Term Loan Fund in 2017 (S7), and the Scipion Active Impact Fund in 2018 (S9). \n\nWait, the user specified \"in the specified years.\" But the question doesn't mention specific years beyond what's in the passage. The funds are mentioned with their launch years. So I should list each fund with their respective years. \n\nI need to make sure each fund is correctly cited. For example, S4 is 2007, S6 is 2010, S7 is 2017, and S9 is 2018. \n\nSo the answer should state that Nicolas Clavel founded Scipion Capital in 2007, and under his leadership, the funds were launched in those years. Each fund's launch year is in the passage. \n\nI need to structure the sentences properly, citing the correct sources. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any funds. The passage mentions four funds with their years. \n\nYes, that's all. So the final answer should have two statements: one about his role and the founding, and another listing the funds with their years, each cited appropriately."
