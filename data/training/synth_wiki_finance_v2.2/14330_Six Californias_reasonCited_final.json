      "answer": "<statement>The key legal hurdles in establishing the six new states included constitutional questions about whether a U.S. state could split via popular initiative and whether new states could be created under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution by dividing an existing state\u2019s territory.

[S81] His piece, published by the law group Justia, raised several constitutional questions on the proposal, including whether the people of a U.S. [S82] state can authorize such a split by popular initiative, and whether several new states can be validly created under Article IV by splitting the territory of a single existing state. [S83] Furthermore, Draper, as the appointed \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal in court, may not actually be able to do so because of both the U.S. [S84] Supreme Court's ruling in *Hollingsworth v. [S85] Perry*; and Article II, Section 12, of the California Constitution that prohibits any constitutional amendment that names a specific individual to hold a particular office. [S86] Amar also wrote that the measure might be blocked by the California courts on grounds that it is a *revision* to the California constitution instead of an *amendment*. [S87] A proposed revision to the California constitution, a change that substantially alters the state's basic governmental framework, must originate from either the Legislature or a constitutional convention, not from a ballot initiative.

[S89] It would be the job of the 24 member commission to decide. [S90] If the university system were to split, a report identified a potential increase in tuition for current Californians who attend a University of California campus, particularly residents in California's most northern state of Jefferson who would not have a single UC campus in the state. [S91] Based on the report's findings, Six Californias could result in over 60% of California students being classified as out-of-state, costing Californian families $2.5 billion more per year. [S92] California's prison system is also unequally spread out. [S93] If the prison system were to split, the new urban states of Silicon Valley and West California would each have to construct several new prisons since most of the current ones in California are located in the rural areas. [S94] California's current water and water rights issues would also have to have been resolved among the new states. [S95] The California, Hetch Hetchy, Los Angeles, Mokelumne, and other major aqueducts would cross the new state lines. [S96] If not reorganized into a multistate function, this would result in the new states of Silicon Valley and West California having to heavily rely on importing water from the other states.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Six Californias\n\n\n# Six Californias\n\n\n\n**Six Californias** was a proposed initiative to split the U.S. [S2] state of California into six states. [S3] It failed to qualify as a California ballot measure for the 2016 state elections due to receiving insufficient signatures. [S4] Venture capitalist Tim Draper launched the measure in December 2013. [S5] He spent in excess of $5 million trying to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 for political consultants. [S6] Had the measure passed, it would not have legally split California immediately; consent would eventually need to be given by both the California State Legislature and the U.S. [S7] Congress to admit the new states to the union per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S8] Constitution. [S9] Rather, the measure would have established several procedures within the state government and its 58 counties to prepare California for the proposed split, and instructed the Governor of California to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress. [S10] The proposed states would have been named Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California. [S11] Draper's stated reasoning for the proposal was that the state is too large and ungovernable, and he therefore wanted to split California to produce six smaller and more efficient state governments. [S12] Opponents argued that it would have been a waste of money and resources to split California and create these new governments. [S13] Critics also charged that this was a money and political power grab designed to separate California's higher-income communities from lower-income areas, and to diminish the state's reliability as a predominantly Democratic Party-supporting \"blue state\". [S14] ## Background\n\nArticle IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S15] Constitution outlines the procedure for the admission of new U.S. [S16] states. [S17] It reads:\n\n> New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. [S18] There are several precedents for the partition of states:\n\n* Vermont, admitted in 1791, was created from territory to which a disputed claim was asserted by New York. [S19] (It had formerly also been claimed by New Hampshire, but that claim had been given up in 1782. [S20] Vermont had already been under a de facto separate government for over a decade.) New York's legislature consented in 1790. [S21] * Kentucky split from Virginia in 1792. [S22] Virginia's legislature consented to the partition when the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, but then the new Constitution of the United States superseded the Articles and the legislature's consent was passed again. [S23] * North Carolina ceded territory to the federal government which became the Southwest Territory and five years later in 1796 became the state of Tennessee;\n* Georgia ceded land that later became part of Alabama. [S24] Two instances were a result of slavery:\n\n* The 1820 Missouri Compromise balanced the number of free and slave states by splitting Maine from Massachusetts in 1820 and admitting Missouri in 1821. [S25] However, the partition of Maine from Massachusetts had been proposed well over three decades earlier for reasons other than slavery. [S26] * West Virginia was admitted to the U.S. [S27] as a separate state in 1863 when the Union-loyal Restored Government of Virginia broke from Virginia after Virginia joined the Confederate States of America in 1861, though most of the new state's counties had in fact supported secession. [S28] California has been the subject of more than 220 proposals to divide it into multiple states, including at least 27 serious proposals. [S29] Several of these attempts proposed the creation of a State of Jefferson that would span the contiguous, mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key legal and procedural hurdles in establishing the six new states and how the 24-member Commission played a role in those challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, but the main details are in Passage 1. Let me scan through the sentences there.\n\nLooking at the sentences, there's mention of the 24-member Commission needing to decide on dividing state resources and debt (S75). That's a procedural hurdle. Also, the Commission's role in determining how state functions like the university system and water rights would be reorganized (S89, S95). \n\nLegal hurdles include constitutional questions. For example, Vikram Amar's analysis (S81-S82) about whether a state can split via popular initiative and if new states can be created under Article IV. There's also the issue of the measure being a constitutional revision rather than an amendment (S86-S87), which requires different procedures. The Supreme Court case Hollingsworth v. Perry (S84) and California's Constitution Article II, Section 12 (S84) might prevent Draper from defending the proposal. \n\nThe Commission's role is tied to these challenges because they had to handle the distribution of resources, debt, and state functions, which are part of the procedural steps. However, the legal challenges, like the constitutional amendments and court rulings, would have complicated the Commission's tasks. \n\nI need to make sure each statement cites the correct sentences. For example, the Commission's role in resource division is S75 and S89. The legal hurdles include the constitutional questions (S81-S82, S86-S87) and the need for congressional approval (S7, S8). Also, the issue of the measure being a revision vs. amendment (S87) is a key point. \n\nI should structure the answer by first listing the legal hurdles with their citations, then the procedural ones, and explain how the Commission was involved in the procedural aspects. Make sure each sentence in the answer has the right citations."

[S3] It failed to qualify as a California ballot measure for the 2016 state elections due to receiving insufficient signatures. [S4] Venture capitalist Tim Draper launched the measure in December 2013. [S5] He spent in excess of $5 million trying to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 for political consultants. [S6] Had the measure passed, it would not have legally split California immediately; consent would eventually need to be given by both the California State Legislature and the U.S. [S7] Congress to admit the new states to the union per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S8] Constitution. [S9] Rather, the measure would have established several procedures within the state government and its 58 counties to prepare California for the proposed split, and instructed the Governor of California to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress. [S10] The proposed states would have been named Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California. [S11] Draper's stated reasoning for the proposal was that the state is too large and ungovernable, and he therefore wanted to split California to produce six smaller and more efficient state governments. [S12] Opponents argued that it would have been a waste of money and resources to split California and create these new governments. [S13] Critics also charged that this was a money and political power grab designed to separate California's higher-income communities from lower-income areas, and to diminish the state's reliability as a predominantly Democratic Party-supporting \"blue state\". [S14] ## Background\n\nArticle IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S15] Constitution outlines the procedure for the admission of new U.S. [S16] states. [S17] It reads:\n\n> New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. [S18] There are several precedents for the partition of states:\n\n* Vermont, admitted in 1791, was created from territory to which a disputed claim was asserted by New York. [S19] (It had formerly also been claimed by New Hampshire, but that claim had been given up in 1782. [S20] Vermont had already been under a de facto separate government for over a decade.) New York's legislature consented in 1790. [S21] * Kentucky split from Virginia in 1792. [S22] Virginia's legislature consented to the partition when the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, but then the new Constitution of the United States superseded the Articles and the legislature's consent was passed again. [S23] * North Carolina ceded territory to the federal government which became the Southwest Territory and five years later in 1796 became the state of Tennessee;\n* Georgia ceded land that later became part of Alabama. [S24] Two instances were a result of slavery:\n\n* The 1820 Missouri Compromise balanced the number of free and slave states by splitting Maine from Massachusetts in 1820 and admitting Missouri in 1821. [S25] However, the partition of Maine from Massachusetts had been proposed well over three decades earlier for reasons other than slavery. [S26] * West Virginia was admitted to the U.S. [S27] as a separate state in 1863 when the Union-loyal Restored Government of Virginia broke from Virginia after Virginia joined the Confederate States of America in 1861, though most of the new state's counties had in fact supported secession. [S28] California has been the subject of more than 220 proposals to divide it into multiple states, including at least 27 serious proposals. [S29] Several of these attempts proposed the creation of a State of Jefferson that would span the contiguous, mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the historical precedents for state division cited in the passage and how they relate to the constitutional requirements for the Six Californias proposal.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions several historical examples of state divisions. Let me scan through the text again. \n\nIn Passage 2, under the \"Background\" section, there's a list of precedents. The sentences [S19] to [S28] detail these examples. For instance, Vermont was created from New York's territory, Kentucky split from Virginia, Tennessee from North Carolina's ceded land, Georgia's land leading to Alabama, the Missouri Compromise with Maine and Missouri, and West Virginia during the Civil War. \n\nNow, the question also asks how these precedents relate to the constitutional requirements. The relevant part here is the mention of Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution in [S17], which states that new states can't be formed without the consent of the legislatures of the states involved and Congress. The historical examples likely show that such divisions required consent from the original states, which ties into the constitutional requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the passage discusses the Six Californias proposal's challenges, like needing Congressional approval and the issues with the California Constitution. The constitutional questions raised by Vikram Amar in [S82] and [S83] about whether the split can be done via a popular initiative and under Article IV are key. The historical precedents might indicate that such a division would need similar consents, which the Six Californias plan might not have properly addressed, especially since it's a ballot initiative rather than a legislative action.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The historical precedents are in [S19] to [S28], but the user might want the specific sentences that mention each example. However, the answer should list the precedents and then connect them to the constitutional requirements. The constitutional part is covered in [S17] and the discussion about Article IV. Also, the part about the Six Californias needing Congressional approval is in [S7] and [S9].\n\nSo, the answer should mention the historical examples from the passage and link them to the constitutional requirements, particularly Article IV's need for state legislatures' consent. The citations would be the sentences that list the precedents and the ones discussing the constitutional aspects."

[S81] His piece, published by the law group Justia, raised several constitutional questions on the proposal, including whether the people of a U.S. [S82] state can authorize such a split by popular initiative, and whether several new states can be validly created under Article IV by splitting the territory of a single existing state. [S83] Furthermore, Draper, as the appointed \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal in court, may not actually be able to do so because of both the U.S. [S84] Supreme Court's ruling in *Hollingsworth v.

[S91] Based on the report's findings, Six Californias could result in over 60% of California students being classified as out-of-state, costing Californian families $2.5 billion more per year. [S92] California's prison system is also unequally spread out. [S93] If the prison system were to split, the new urban states of Silicon Valley and West California would each have to construct several new prisons since most of the current ones in California are located in the rural areas.

[S117] Phillip Bump of the *Washington Post* wrote that \"this entire plan is really about creating Silicon Valley as its own state. [S118] Therefore Silicon Valley gets to be a state called 'Silicon Valley,' and it gets to make its politics and its money more dense, and everyone in the idyllic dream of Silicon Valley gets to be happy.\"\n\nBrendan Nyhan said that the idea would be unlikely to pass Congress due to disruption it would cause in the political balance of the U.S. [S119] Senate, as well as other sticking points. [S120] Opponents said that the initiative was a thinly disguised Republican power play aimed at diminishing the electoral votes that have historically gone to Democrats in California. [S121] In a survey of the California congressional delegation, *The Hill* found that the Democrats opposed the proposition, while the Republicans were generally divided. [S122] Thus, a couple of political experts countered that the measure would not get the approval of all the parties needed; the voters would not necessarily wish to break up the state with the cost of setting up six new state governments and five new capitals, and Congress may not want five more states in the mix. [S123] ## Subsequent attempt\n\nA subsequent Draper initiative to divide California was launched in August 2017. [S124] The measure was titled by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra \"Division of California into Three States\", though it is commonly known as Cal 3. [S125] On June 13, 2018, it was announced that among the 600,000 signatures the initiative had received there were more than the 365,880 valid signatures needed, and the initiative would be put to the vote in November 2018. [S126] However, in July 2018, the California Supreme Court pulled it from the ballot for further state constitutional review.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S97] The report by the California Legislative Analyst's Office specifically named several other major issues that could have been affected by the decisions made by the leaders of each new state: crime, public safety and gun control/ownership; economic development; the environment; public employee pensions; laws related to marriage and family; taxes; and transportation and other infrastructure. [S98] Each new state could adopt different laws, either stricter or more lenient, on those issues than what California currently has on the books. [S99] These differing policies would have in turn eventually result in long-term demographic and economic changes, as various groups of people will want to migrate to those new states with laws more favorable to them. [S100] Vikram Amar agrees there are governance problems in California. [S101] The demographic, cultural, political and economic differences between the urban and rural areas of California are obvious, as are the tensions between the major urban areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles. [S102] However splitting California is a radical change, and a major question is whether the newly formed poorer states can make it without the tax revenues from the major metropolitan areas. [S103] The political makeup in Washington D.C. [S104] at the time of approval, may determine the success or failure of six Californias. [S105] Twelve Senators would result from six Californias, as well as a probable change in total house House seats and their electoral votes. [S106] According to Amar, \"we could expect four [Senators] (from Silicon Valley and West California) to consistently be Democrats, and four (from Jefferson and Central California) to lean Republican, with the other four (from Northern California and South California) harder to predict\". [S107] ## Stances on the proposal\n\n\n### Support\n\nTim Draper indicated that the initiative was motivated by the belief that California is ungovernable as is with legislature unable to keep up on issues in all the state's regions, especially in areas such as job creation, education, affordable housing, and water and transportation infrastructure. [S108] Furthermore, he believed that the current state government is getting out of touch with the people of California. [S109] According to Draper, splitting up the state would allow the resulting new state governments to be closer to their people than the current California state government. [S110] ### Opposition\n\nOneCalifornia, a bi-partisan committee to oppose the Six Californias ballot proposal, was formed in April 2014. [S111] It is co-chaired by Joe Rodota, former Cabinet Secretary for Governor Pete Wilson; and Steven Maviglio, former Press Secretary to Governor Gray Davis. [S112] The committee suggested that the initiative was damaging the state's image in the world economy. [S113] Rodota stated: \"Every day this measure marches its way toward the ballot it damages the California brand as the nation's economic powerhouse. [S114] It has negative implications that could cost California's businesses and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\" In an opinion piece in the *U-T San Diego*, Maviglio and Rodota wrote that if the measure passes, it \"will set in motion the most bureaucratic, costly, paper-pushing process in our history ... [S115] we'd spend years doing nothing more than rewriting laws, duplicating government offices, and spending billions of dollars unnecessarily.\" Furthermore, that it could increase the lobbying industry sixfold in California \"to deal with the flood of open questions\", and would be a burden on California businesses due to the increase of federal regulations regarding interstate commerce.",

[S121] In a survey of the California congressional delegation, *The Hill* found that the Democrats opposed the proposition, while the Republicans were generally divided. [S122] Thus, a couple of political experts countered that the measure would not get the approval of all the parties needed; the voters would not necessarily wish to break up the state with the cost of setting up six new state governments and five new capitals, and Congress may not want five more states in the mix. [S123] ## Subsequent attempt\n\nA subsequent Draper initiative to divide California was launched in August 2017. [S124] The measure was titled by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra \"Division of California into Three States\", though it is commonly known as Cal 3. [S125] On June 13, 2018, it was announced that among the 600,000 signatures the initiative had received there were more than the 365,880 valid signatures needed, and the initiative would be put to the vote in November 2018. [S126] However, in July 2018, the California Supreme Court pulled it from the ballot for further state constitutional review.",
        "[S97] The report by the California Legislative Analyst's Office specifically named several other major issues that could have been affected by the decisions made by the leaders of each new state: crime, public safety and gun control/ownership; economic development; the environment; public employee pensions; laws related to marriage and family; taxes; and transportation and other infrastructure. [S98] Each new state could adopt different laws, either stricter or more lenient, on those issues than what California currently has on the books. [S99] These differing policies would have in turn eventually result in long-term demographic and economic changes, as various groups of people will want to migrate to those new states with laws more favorable to them. [S100] Vikram Amar agrees there are governance problems in California. [S101] The demographic, cultural, political and economic differences between the urban and rural areas of California are obvious, as are the tensions between the major urban areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles. [S102] However splitting California is a radical change, and a major question is whether the newly formed poorer states can make it without the tax revenues from the major metropolitan areas. [S103] The political makeup in Washington D.C. [S104] at the time of approval, may determine the success or failure of six Californias. [S105] Twelve Senators would result from six Californias, as well as a probable change in total house House seats and their electoral votes. [S106] According to Amar, \"we could expect four [Senators] (from Silicon Valley and West California) to consistently be Democrats, and four (from Jefferson and Central California) to lean Republican, with the other four (from Northern California and South California) harder to predict\". [S107] ## Stances on the proposal\n\n\n### Support\n\nTim Draper indicated that the initiative was motivated by the belief that California is ungovernable as is with legislature unable to keep up on issues in all the state's regions, especially in areas such as job creation, education, affordable housing, and water and transportation infrastructure. [S108] Furthermore, he believed that the current state government is getting out of touch with the people of California. [S109] According to Draper, splitting up the state would allow the resulting new state governments to be closer to their people than the current California state government. [S110] ### Opposition\n\nOneCalifornia, a bi-partisan committee to oppose the Six Californias ballot proposal, was formed in April 2014. [S111] It is co-chaired by Joe Rodota, former Cabinet Secretary for Governor Pete Wilson; and Steven Maviglio, former Press Secretary to Governor Gray Davis. [S112] The committee suggested that the initiative was damaging the state's image in the world economy. [S113] Rodota stated: \"Every day this measure marches its way toward the ballot it damages the California brand as the nation's economic powerhouse. [S114] It has negative implications that could cost California's businesses and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\" In an opinion piece in the *U-T San Diego*, Maviglio and Rodota wrote that if the measure passes, it \"will set in motion the most bureaucratic, costly, paper-pushing process in our history ... [S115] we'd spend years doing nothing more than rewriting laws, duplicating government offices, and spending billions of dollars unnecessarily.\" Furthermore, that it could increase the lobbying industry sixfold in California \"to deal with the flood of open questions\", and would be a burden on California businesses due to the increase of federal regulations regarding interstate commerce."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the political composition of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives affected the feasibility of the Six Californias proposal, and what Vikram Amar predicted about the new states' political leanings.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passages. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a mention that Brendan Nyhan said the idea would be unlikely to pass Congress due to disruption in the political balance of the Senate and other issues. That's relevant to the first part of the question. Also, there's a part about opponents calling it a Republican power play to diminish Democratic electoral votes. But the user is asking about the Senate and House composition's role. \n\nThen in Passage 2, there's a sentence that says \"The political makeup in Washington D.C. at the time of approval, may determine the success or failure of six Californias.\" That's a direct link between the political composition and feasibility. Also, \"Twelve Senators would result from six Californias, as well as a probable change in total house seats and their electoral votes.\" So splitting into six states would add more senators and house seats, which would affect the political balance. \n\nRegarding Vikram Amar's prediction, in Passage 2, there's a sentence: \"According to Amar, 'we could expect four [Senators] (from Silicon Valley and West California) to consistently be Democrats, and four (from Jefferson and Central California) to lean Republican, with the other four (from Northern California and South California) harder to predict'.\" That's his prediction on the new states' political leanings.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the first part, the political composition's effect: [S119] and [S120] mention the disruption in the Senate and the Republican power play. Also, [S104] and [S105] talk about the political makeup in Washington D.C. and the change in Senate and House seats. \n\nFor Amar's prediction, the relevant sentence is [S107]. \n\nWait, the user wants the feasibility factors. So the Senate and House composition would influence whether the proposal passes. The context mentions that opponents thought it would disrupt the political balance, making it hard to get Congress's approval. Also, the addition of new states would change the number of representatives, which could affect the balance. \n\nSo the answer should connect the political composition (Senate and House) to the feasibility, citing the relevant sentences. Then, Amar's prediction is in [S107]."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S31] Six Californias was introduced in December 2013 by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. [S32] California Secretary of State Debra Bowen approved Draper to begin collecting petition signatures in February 2014. [S33] The petition needed to submit sufficient valid signatures of registered California voters by July 18, 2014, to qualify as a November election ballot proposition. [S34] As the petition deadline drew closer, Draper suggested that the initiative would be postponed to 2016, since that would allow more time to educate the public on the initiative. [S35] On July 14, Draper announced that the proposal received 1.3 million signatures, enough to qualify for the ballot, and began submitting them to elections officials. [S36] Had sufficient signatures been verified, per California law, it would have qualified for the November 2016 state ballot. [S37] On September 12, 2014, California state election officials announced that based on random sampling of the submitted signatures, only an estimated 752,685 signatures were valid, which was insufficient not only to qualify the initiative for the ballot, but also to trigger a complete verification of all submitted signatures.

[S42] conduct a review of the signatures determined to be invalid by the registrars in several counties to determine if they were in fact valid signatures.\" To qualify for a full check of all signatures in all fifty-eight counties, the review must find about 450 wrongly invalidated signatures among those submitted in the fifteen counties that sampled 3% of the total signatures submitted in each of those fifteen counties. [S43] As of November 17, 2014, the campaign has not updated its web site with information about the results of their review of the supposedly invalid signatures. [S44] Opponents of the initiative filed a complaint with Secretary of State Debra Bowen on July 17, 2014, asking her office to investigate allegations of voter fraud. [S45] The complaint, filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee formally opposing the Six Californias initiative, follows reports that signature gatherers for Six Californias claimed that those who signed \"would be opposing the Attorney General of California's intention to split the state into six states\" \u2013 the exact opposite of the petitions intentions. [S46] Signature gathering for Six Californias was carried out by Arno Political Consultants. [S47] The campaign for Six Californias also paid $51,000 to Crowds on Demand, a service that sends paid actors to form crowds at gatherings such as political rallies. [S48] Organizers for Six Californias stated Crowds on Demand provided personnel for signature gathering. [S49] ## Measure details\n\nThe measure outlined the proposed new states, then established several procedures within the state government and all the counties to prepare California for the proposed split. [S50] The proposal would then have needed the approval of voters in California, the Congress of the United States (per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S51] Constitution), and the California State Legislature. [S52] ### Proposed states\n\nSix Californias would have divided the state's 58 counties among six new states: Jefferson (based on the historic State of Jefferson proposal), North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S53] | Proposed state | Estimated population |\n| --- | --- |\n| Jefferson | 949,409 |\n| North California | 3,820,438 |\n| Silicon Valley | 6,828,617 |\n| Central California | 4,232,419 |\n| West California | 11,563,717 |\n| South California | 10,809,997 |\n\n\n#### Jefferson\n\nThe state of Jefferson would have been created from the far north part of California, bordering Oregon, consisting of fourteen counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama, and Trinity. [S54] Unlike the historic State of Jefferson proposal, this new state would not include any territory from Oregon. [S55] #### North California\n\nThe state of North California would have been south of Jefferson spanning from the Pacific Ocean to Nevada. [S56] North California would have consisted of thirteen counties: Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba. [S57] #### Silicon Valley\n\nThe state of Silicon Valley would have spanned the coastline from San Francisco to Monterey. [S58] It would have consisted of eight counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. [S59] #### Central California\n\nThe state of Central California would have been between Silicon Valley and Nevada. [S60] It would have consisted of the fourteen counties north of Los Angeles and south of Sacramento: Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. [S61] #### West California\n\nThe state of West California would have been south of Silicon Valley and Central California, and west of the current San Bernardino County. [S62] It would have consisted of four counties: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. [S63] #### South California\n\nThe state of South California would have been made up of the southernmost part of the state, bordering Mexico and Arizona. [S64] It would have consisted of five counties: Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. [S65] ### State-splitting process and other procedures\n\nThe above division was not set in stone. [S66] The proposal allowed a county along one of the proposed new state borders to join an adjacent state instead, subject to the approval of both that county's voters (via a county ballot measure) and its Boards of Supervisors by November 15, 2017. [S67] A board of 24 commissioners would also have been appointed to negotiate how to divide California's existing assets and liabilities among the new states. [S68] The initiative also explicitly stated that the Governor of California will be required to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress by January 1, 2018. [S69] In addition, California's charter counties would have been allowed more power over municipal affairs that currently may be controlled by city governments. [S70] This change was meant for the interim period between the passing of the initiative and congressional approval of the new states, but would have remained in place even if Congress did not pass the state-splitting proposal. [S71] In final section of the initiative, \"the official proponent of the initiative\" (Draper) was to be appointed as an \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal against legal challenges. [S72] ## Analysis\n\nPolitically, North California, Silicon Valley, West California, and to a lesser extent South California would lean Democratic, while Jefferson and especially Central California would be competitive.",

        "[S31] Six Californias was introduced in December 2013 by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. [S32] California Secretary of State Debra Bowen approved Draper to begin collecting petition signatures in February 2014. [S33] The petition needed to submit sufficient valid signatures of registered California voters by July 18, 2014, to qualify as a November election ballot proposition. [S34] As the petition deadline drew closer, Draper suggested that the initiative would be postponed to 2016, since that would allow more time to educate the public on the initiative. [S35] On July 14, Draper announced that the proposal received 1.3 million signatures, enough to qualify for the ballot, and began submitting them to elections officials. [S36] Had sufficient signatures been verified, per California law, it would have qualified for the November 2016 state ballot. [S37] On September 12, 2014, California state election officials announced that based on random sampling of the submitted signatures, only an estimated 752,685 signatures were valid, which was insufficient not only to qualify the initiative for the ballot, but also to trigger a complete verification of all submitted signatures. [S38] These estimated valid signatures were 66.15% of the 1,137,844 submitted signatures. [S39] At least 807,615 signatures, 70.98% of the submitted signatures, had to be valid for the measure to qualify for the ballot. [S40] At least 767,235 signatures, 67.43% of the submitted signatures, had to be estimated to be valid in order for the petition to qualify for a second mandatory phase to review all of the submitted signatures, not just random samples. [S41] Also on September 12, 2014, the campaign announced its intent to \"... [S42] conduct a review of the signatures determined to be invalid by the registrars in several counties to determine if they were in fact valid signatures.\" To qualify for a full check of all signatures in all fifty-eight counties, the review must find about 450 wrongly invalidated signatures among those submitted in the fifteen counties that sampled 3% of the total signatures submitted in each of those fifteen counties. [S43] As of November 17, 2014, the campaign has not updated its web site with information about the results of their review of the supposedly invalid signatures. [S44] Opponents of the initiative filed a complaint with Secretary of State Debra Bowen on July 17, 2014, asking her office to investigate allegations of voter fraud. [S45] The complaint, filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee formally opposing the Six Californias initiative, follows reports that signature gatherers for Six Californias claimed that those who signed \"would be opposing the Attorney General of California's intention to split the state into six states\" \u2013 the exact opposite of the petitions intentions. [S46] Signature gathering for Six Californias was carried out by Arno Political Consultants. [S47] The campaign for Six Californias also paid $51,000 to Crowds on Demand, a service that sends paid actors to form crowds at gatherings such as political rallies. [S48] Organizers for Six Californias stated Crowds on Demand provided personnel for signature gathering. [S49] ## Measure details\n\nThe measure outlined the proposed new states, then established several procedures within the state government and all the counties to prepare California for the proposed split. [S50] The proposal would then have needed the approval of voters in California, the Congress of the United States (per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S51] Constitution), and the California State Legislature.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the Six Californias initiative proposed to handle county boundary adjustments and the conditions for a county to join a different state.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The key parts would be under the \"State-splitting process and other procedures\" section. Let me check there.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a sentence that says: \"The above division was not set in stone. The proposal allowed a county along one of the proposed new state borders to join an adjacent state instead, subject to the approval of both that county's voters (via a county ballot measure) and its Boards of Supervisors by November 15, 2017.\" That seems to answer the first part about handling boundary adjustments. The conditions are approval from voters via a ballot measure and the Boards of Supervisors by a specific date.\n\nAnother sentence mentions a board of 24 commissioners to negotiate asset and liability divisions, but that's more about assets than boundary adjustments. The rest of the details about the states' compositions don't directly answer the question. \n\nI should make sure there's no other info. The answer should cite the sentences that mention the county's ability to join another state with the specified conditions. The relevant sentences are [S66] and [S67]. \n\nSo the statement would explain that counties could adjust boundaries if they get voter approval and supervisor approval by November 2017. The citations would be [S66][S67]."

[S52] ### Proposed states\n\nSix Californias would have divided the state's 58 counties among six new states: Jefferson (based on the historic State of Jefferson proposal), North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S53] | Proposed state | Estimated population |\n| --- | --- |\n| Jefferson | 949,409 |\n| North California | 3,820,438 |\n| Silicon Valley | 6,828,617 |\n| Central California | 4,232,419 |\n| West California | 11,563,717 |\n| South California | 10,809,997 |\n\n\n#### Jefferson\n\nThe state of Jefferson would have been created from the far north part of California, bordering Oregon, consisting of fourteen counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama, and Trinity. [S54] Unlike the historic State of Jefferson proposal, this new state would not include any territory from Oregon. [S55] #### North California\n\nThe state of North California would have been south of Jefferson spanning from the Pacific Ocean to Nevada. [S56] North California would have consisted of thirteen counties: Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba. [S57] #### Silicon Valley\n\nThe state of Silicon Valley would have spanned the coastline from San Francisco to Monterey. [S58] It would have consisted of eight counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. [S59] #### Central California\n\nThe state of Central California would have been between Silicon Valley and Nevada. [S60] It would have consisted of the fourteen counties north of Los Angeles and south of Sacramento: Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. [S61] #### West California\n\nThe state of West California would have been south of Silicon Valley and Central California, and west of the current San Bernardino County. [S62] It would have consisted of four counties: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. [S63] #### South California\n\nThe state of South California would have been made up of the southernmost part of the state, bordering Mexico and Arizona. [S64] It would have consisted of five counties: Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. [S65] ### State-splitting process and other procedures\n\nThe above division was not set in stone. [S66] The proposal allowed a county along one of the proposed new state borders to join an adjacent state instead, subject to the approval of both that county's voters (via a county ballot measure) and its Boards of Supervisors by November 15, 2017. [S67] A board of 24 commissioners would also have been appointed to negotiate how to divide California's existing assets and liabilities among the new states. [S68] The initiative also explicitly stated that the Governor of California will be required to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress by January 1, 2018. [S69] In addition, California's charter counties would have been allowed more power over municipal affairs that currently may be controlled by city governments. [S70] This change was meant for the interim period between the passing of the initiative and congressional approval of the new states, but would have remained in place even if Congress did not pass the state-splitting proposal. [S71] In final section of the initiative, \"the official proponent of the initiative\" (Draper) was to be appointed as an \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal against legal challenges. [S72] ## Analysis\n\nPolitically, North California, Silicon Valley, West California, and to a lesser extent South California would lean Democratic, while Jefferson and especially Central California would be competitive.",

        "[S31] Six Californias was introduced in December 2013 by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. [S32] California Secretary of State Debra Bowen approved Draper to begin collecting petition signatures in February 2014. [S33] The petition needed to submit sufficient valid signatures of registered California voters by July 18, 2014, to qualify as a November election ballot proposition. [S34] As the petition deadline drew closer, Draper suggested that the initiative would be postponed to 2016, since that would allow more time to educate the public on the initiative. [S35] On July 14, Draper announced that the proposal received 1.3 million signatures, enough to qualify for the ballot, and began submitting them to elections officials. [S36] Had sufficient signatures been verified, per California law, it would have qualified for the November 2016 state ballot. [S37] On September 12, 2014, California state election officials announced that based on random sampling of the submitted signatures, only an estimated 752,685 signatures were valid, which was insufficient not only to qualify the initiative for the ballot, but also to trigger a complete verification of all submitted signatures. [S38] These estimated valid signatures were 66.15% of the 1,137,844 submitted signatures. [S39] At least 807,615 signatures, 70.98% of the submitted signatures, had to be valid for the measure to qualify for the ballot. [S40] At least 767,235 signatures, 67.43% of the submitted signatures, had to be estimated to be valid in order for the petition to qualify for a second mandatory phase to review all of the submitted signatures, not just random samples. [S41] Also on September 12, 2014, the campaign announced its intent to \"... [S42] conduct a review of the signatures determined to be invalid by the registrars in several counties to determine if they were in fact valid signatures.\" To qualify for a full check of all signatures in all fifty-eight counties, the review must find about 450 wrongly invalidated signatures among those submitted in the fifteen counties that sampled 3% of the total signatures submitted in each of those fifteen counties. [S43] As of November 17, 2014, the campaign has not updated its web site with information about the results of their review of the supposedly invalid signatures. [S44] Opponents of the initiative filed a complaint with Secretary of State Debra Bowen on July 17, 2014, asking her office to investigate allegations of voter fraud. [S45] The complaint, filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee formally opposing the Six Californias initiative, follows reports that signature gatherers for Six Californias claimed that those who signed \"would be opposing the Attorney General of California's intention to split the state into six states\" \u2013 the exact opposite of the petitions intentions. [S46] Signature gathering for Six Californias was carried out by Arno Political Consultants. [S47] The campaign for Six Californias also paid $51,000 to Crowds on Demand, a service that sends paid actors to form crowds at gatherings such as political rallies. [S48] Organizers for Six Californias stated Crowds on Demand provided personnel for signature gathering.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the allegations of misconduct against the Six Californias campaign and the entities involved. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find any mentions of misconduct allegations and the parties involved.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passages. In Passage 1, there's a mention of opponents filing a complaint with the Secretary of State. Specifically, sentence S44 says that opponents filed a complaint asking for an investigation into allegations of voter fraud. The complaint was filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee. So that's one entity: OneCalifornia committee. The allegation here is voter fraud.\n\nThen, looking further, there's a part about the signature gatherers for Six Californias claiming that those who signed would be opposing the Attorney General's intention to split the state. That's in S45. So the allegation here is that the signature gatherers misrepresented the purpose of the petition. The entities involved here might be the campaign itself, as they were the ones gathering signatures, and possibly Arno Political Consultants, since they were the ones doing the signature gathering (S46). Also, Crowds on Demand was paid by the campaign (S47), but I'm not sure if that's directly related to misconduct. The mention of Crowds on Demand is about providing personnel for signature gathering, but maybe that's part of the misconduct? The context doesn't explicitly say, so maybe not. \n\nAnother point is the campaign's review of invalid signatures (S42), but that's more about their process rather than misconduct. The main allegations seem to be voter fraud and misrepresentation of the petition's purpose. The entities involved are the OneCalifornia committee (as the complainants) and the Six Californias campaign, possibly through their signature gatherers. \n\nI need to check if there are other mentions. The passage also mentions that the campaign paid Crowds on Demand, but unless there's a direct link to misconduct, maybe that's not relevant. The key points are the voter fraud allegation by the opponents and the misrepresentation by the signature gatherers. \n\nSo the answer should list the allegations: voter fraud and misrepresentation of the petition's purpose. The entities involved are the OneCalifornia committee (as the ones filing the complaint) and the Six Californias campaign, possibly through Arno Political Consultants. The citations would be S44 and S45. Also, S46 mentions Arno Political Consultants as the signature gatherers, so they might be involved in the misrepresentation. \n\nWait, the question is about the allegations raised against the campaign. The complaint was filed by the opponents, but the allegations are against the campaign. So the entities involved in the claims would be the campaign and their associates. The OneCalifornia committee is the one making the claims, but the entities involved in the misconduct would be the campaign's organizers. \n\nSo the answer would state that the allegations included voter fraud and misrepresentation of the petition's purpose. The entities involved are the Six Californias campaign, Arno Political Consultants (as signature gatherers), and possibly Crowds on Demand, but the context doesn't explicitly link them to misconduct. The citations would be S44 (voter fraud allegation) and S45 (misrepresentation). Also, S46 mentions Arno Political Consultants as the signature gatherers, which might be part of the misconduct. \n\nI need to structure the sentences with proper citations. Each sentence should have the relevant citations. So first sentence about the voter fraud allegation from the opponents, citing S44. Then the misrepresentation by the signature gatherers, citing S45 and S46. That should cover it."

[S75] During the two-year period between passage of the measure, the 24-member Commission would have had to decide how the California state resources would be divided and how the present debt would be distributed between the six states. [S76] The areas most affected would have been required to make decisions including school funding, health and social services, water management, and the handling of prisons. [S77] Each new state would have also been faced with new budgets, establishing methods of revenue, funding infrastructure, public employee compensation, and new, revised or discarded laws. [S78] Most likely, many issues would have had to be resolved by the courts. [S79] The Huffington Post further published a map detailing how splitting California would result in these separate rich states and poor states. [S80] Vikram Amar wrote a preliminary analysis of the difficulties that the Six Californias measure would face. [S81] His piece, published by the law group Justia, raised several constitutional questions on the proposal, including whether the people of a U.S. [S82] state can authorize such a split by popular initiative, and whether several new states can be validly created under Article IV by splitting the territory of a single existing state. [S83] Furthermore, Draper, as the appointed \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal in court, may not actually be able to do so because of both the U.S. [S84] Supreme Court's ruling in *Hollingsworth v. [S85] Perry*; and Article II, Section 12, of the California Constitution that prohibits any constitutional amendment that names a specific individual to hold a particular office. [S86] Amar also wrote that the measure might be blocked by the California courts on grounds that it is a *revision* to the California constitution instead of an *amendment*. [S87] A proposed revision to the California constitution, a change that substantially alters the state's basic governmental framework, must originate from either the Legislature or a constitutional convention, not from a ballot initiative.

[S91] Based on the report's findings, Six Californias could result in over 60% of California students being classified as out-of-state, costing Californian families $2.5 billion more per year. [S92] California's prison system is also unequally spread out. [S93] If the prison system were to split, the new urban states of Silicon Valley and West California would each have to construct several new prisons since most of the current ones in California are located in the rural areas. [S94] California's current water and water rights issues would also have to have been resolved among the new states. [S95] The California, Hetch Hetchy, Los Angeles, Mokelumne, and other major aqueducts would cross the new state lines. [S96] If not reorganized into a multistate function, this would result in the new states of Silicon Valley and West California having to heavily rely on importing water from the other states.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Six Californias\n\n\n# Six Californias\n\n\n\n**Six Californias** was a proposed initiative to split the U.S. [S2] state of California into six states. [S3] It failed to qualify as a California ballot measure for the 2016 state elections due to receiving insufficient signatures. [S4] Venture capitalist Tim Draper launched the measure in December 2013. [S5] He spent in excess of $5 million trying to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 for political consultants. [S6] Had the measure passed, it would not have legally split California immediately; consent would eventually need to be given by both the California State Legislature and the U.S. [S7] Congress to admit the new states to the union per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S8] Constitution. [S9] Rather, the measure would have established several procedures within the state government and its 58 counties to prepare California for the proposed split, and instructed the Governor of California to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress. [S10] The proposed states would have been named Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California. [S11] Draper's stated reasoning for the proposal was that the state is too large and ungovernable, and he therefore wanted to split California to produce six smaller and more efficient state governments. [S12] Opponents argued that it would have been a waste of money and resources to split California and create these new governments. [S13] Critics also charged that this was a money and political power grab designed to separate California's higher-income communities from lower-income areas, and to diminish the state's reliability as a predominantly Democratic Party-supporting \"blue state\". [S14] ## Background\n\nArticle IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S15] Constitution outlines the procedure for the admission of new U.S. [S16] states.

[S18] There are several precedents for the partition of states:\n\n* Vermont, admitted in 1791, was created from territory to which a disputed claim was asserted by New York. [S19] (It had formerly also been claimed by New Hampshire, but that claim had been given up in 1782. [S20] Vermont had already been under a de facto separate government for over a decade.) New York's legislature consented in 1790. [S21] * Kentucky split from Virginia in 1792. [S22] Virginia's legislature consented to the partition when the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, but then the new Constitution of the United States superseded the Articles and the legislature's consent was passed again. [S23] * North Carolina ceded territory to the federal government which became the Southwest Territory and five years later in 1796 became the state of Tennessee;\n* Georgia ceded land that later became part of Alabama. [S24] Two instances were a result of slavery:\n\n* The 1820 Missouri Compromise balanced the number of free and slave states by splitting Maine from Massachusetts in 1820 and admitting Missouri in 1821. [S25] However, the partition of Maine from Massachusetts had been proposed well over three decades earlier for reasons other than slavery.

Then, S89 says \"It would be the job of the 24 member commission to decide.\" But the direct impact on tuition is mentioned in S90: \"If the university system were to split, a report identified a potential increase in tuition for current Californians who attend a University of California campus, particularly residents in California's most northern state of Jefferson who would not have a single UC campus in the state.\" \n\nAlso, S91 states: \"Based on the report's findings, Six Californias could result in over 60% of California students being classified as out-of-state, costing Californian families $2.5 billion more per year.\" That's a key point about tuition increases. \n\nSo the main points are the potential increase in tuition, especially for residents in Jefferson, and the classification of students as out-of-state leading to higher costs. The citations would be S90 and S91. I need to make sure there are no other sentences that mention the UC system or tuition. Let me check again. \n\nYes, S88 and S89 talk about the reorganization, but the specific impacts on tuition are in S90 and S91. So the answer should reference those two sentences."

    "[S1] Six Californias\n\n\n# Six Californias\n\n\n\n**Six Californias** was a proposed initiative to split the U.S. [S2] state of California into six states. [S3] It failed to qualify as a California ballot measure for the 2016 state elections due to receiving insufficient signatures. [S4] Venture capitalist Tim Draper launched the measure in December 2013. [S5] He spent in excess of $5 million trying to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 for political consultants. [S6] Had the measure passed, it would not have legally split California immediately; consent would eventually need to be given by both the California State Legislature and the U.S. [S7] Congress to admit the new states to the union per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S8] Constitution. [S9] Rather, the measure would have established several procedures within the state government and its 58 counties to prepare California for the proposed split, and instructed the Governor of California to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress. [S10] The proposed states would have been named Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California. [S11] Draper's stated reasoning for the proposal was that the state is too large and ungovernable, and he therefore wanted to split California to produce six smaller and more efficient state governments. [S12] Opponents argued that it would have been a waste of money and resources to split California and create these new governments. [S13] Critics also charged that this was a money and political power grab designed to separate California's higher-income communities from lower-income areas, and to diminish the state's reliability as a predominantly Democratic Party-supporting \"blue state\". [S14] ## Background\n\nArticle IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S15] Constitution outlines the procedure for the admission of new U.S. [S16] states. [S17] It reads:\n\n> New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. [S18] There are several precedents for the partition of states:\n\n* Vermont, admitted in 1791, was created from territory to which a disputed claim was asserted by New York. [S19] (It had formerly also been claimed by New Hampshire, but that claim had been given up in 1782. [S20] Vermont had already been under a de facto separate government for over a decade.) New York's legislature consented in 1790. [S21] * Kentucky split from Virginia in 1792. [S22] Virginia's legislature consented to the partition when the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, but then the new Constitution of the United States superseded the Articles and the legislature's consent was passed again. [S23] * North Carolina ceded territory to the federal government which became the Southwest Territory and five years later in 1796 became the state of Tennessee;\n* Georgia ceded land that later became part of Alabama. [S24] Two instances were a result of slavery:\n\n* The 1820 Missouri Compromise balanced the number of free and slave states by splitting Maine from Massachusetts in 1820 and admitting Missouri in 1821. [S25] However, the partition of Maine from Massachusetts had been proposed well over three decades earlier for reasons other than slavery. [S26] * West Virginia was admitted to the U.S. [S27] as a separate state in 1863 when the Union-loyal Restored Government of Virginia broke from Virginia after Virginia joined the Confederate States of America in 1861, though most of the new state's counties had in fact supported secession. [S28] California has been the subject of more than 220 proposals to divide it into multiple states, including at least 27 serious proposals. [S29] Several of these attempts proposed the creation of a State of Jefferson that would span the contiguous, mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California. [S30] ## Ballot qualification process",
    "[S31] Six Californias was introduced in December 2013 by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. [S32] California Secretary of State Debra Bowen approved Draper to begin collecting petition signatures in February 2014. [S33] The petition needed to submit sufficient valid signatures of registered California voters by July 18, 2014, to qualify as a November election ballot proposition. [S34] As the petition deadline drew closer, Draper suggested that the initiative would be postponed to 2016, since that would allow more time to educate the public on the initiative. [S35] On July 14, Draper announced that the proposal received 1.3 million signatures, enough to qualify for the ballot, and began submitting them to elections officials. [S36] Had sufficient signatures been verified, per California law, it would have qualified for the November 2016 state ballot. [S37] On September 12, 2014, California state election officials announced that based on random sampling of the submitted signatures, only an estimated 752,685 signatures were valid, which was insufficient not only to qualify the initiative for the ballot, but also to trigger a complete verification of all submitted signatures. [S38] These estimated valid signatures were 66.15% of the 1,137,844 submitted signatures. [S39] At least 807,615 signatures, 70.98% of the submitted signatures, had to be valid for the measure to qualify for the ballot. [S40] At least 767,235 signatures, 67.43% of the submitted signatures, had to be estimated to be valid in order for the petition to qualify for a second mandatory phase to review all of the submitted signatures, not just random samples. [S41] Also on September 12, 2014, the campaign announced its intent to \"... [S42] conduct a review of the signatures determined to be invalid by the registrars in several counties to determine if they were in fact valid signatures.\" To qualify for a full check of all signatures in all fifty-eight counties, the review must find about 450 wrongly invalidated signatures among those submitted in the fifteen counties that sampled 3% of the total signatures submitted in each of those fifteen counties. [S43] As of November 17, 2014, the campaign has not updated its web site with information about the results of their review of the supposedly invalid signatures. [S44] Opponents of the initiative filed a complaint with Secretary of State Debra Bowen on July 17, 2014, asking her office to investigate allegations of voter fraud. [S45] The complaint, filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee formally opposing the Six Californias initiative, follows reports that signature gatherers for Six Californias claimed that those who signed \"would be opposing the Attorney General of California's intention to split the state into six states\" \u2013 the exact opposite of the petitions intentions. [S46] Signature gathering for Six Californias was carried out by Arno Political Consultants. [S47] The campaign for Six Californias also paid $51,000 to Crowds on Demand, a service that sends paid actors to form crowds at gatherings such as political rallies. [S48] Organizers for Six Californias stated Crowds on Demand provided personnel for signature gathering. [S49] ## Measure details\n\nThe measure outlined the proposed new states, then established several procedures within the state government and all the counties to prepare California for the proposed split. [S50] The proposal would then have needed the approval of voters in California, the Congress of the United States (per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S51] Constitution), and the California State Legislature. [S52] ### Proposed states\n\nSix Californias would have divided the state's 58 counties among six new states: Jefferson (based on the historic State of Jefferson proposal), North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California.",
    "[S53] | Proposed state | Estimated population |\n| --- | --- |\n| Jefferson | 949,409 |\n| North California | 3,820,438 |\n| Silicon Valley | 6,828,617 |\n| Central California | 4,232,419 |\n| West California | 11,563,717 |\n| South California | 10,809,997 |\n\n\n#### Jefferson\n\nThe state of Jefferson would have been created from the far north part of California, bordering Oregon, consisting of fourteen counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama, and Trinity. [S54] Unlike the historic State of Jefferson proposal, this new state would not include any territory from Oregon. [S55] #### North California\n\nThe state of North California would have been south of Jefferson spanning from the Pacific Ocean to Nevada. [S56] North California would have consisted of thirteen counties: Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba. [S57] #### Silicon Valley\n\nThe state of Silicon Valley would have spanned the coastline from San Francisco to Monterey. [S58] It would have consisted of eight counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. [S59] #### Central California\n\nThe state of Central California would have been between Silicon Valley and Nevada. [S60] It would have consisted of the fourteen counties north of Los Angeles and south of Sacramento: Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. [S61] #### West California\n\nThe state of West California would have been south of Silicon Valley and Central California, and west of the current San Bernardino County. [S62] It would have consisted of four counties: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. [S63] #### South California\n\nThe state of South California would have been made up of the southernmost part of the state, bordering Mexico and Arizona. [S64] It would have consisted of five counties: Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. [S65] ### State-splitting process and other procedures\n\nThe above division was not set in stone. [S66] The proposal allowed a county along one of the proposed new state borders to join an adjacent state instead, subject to the approval of both that county's voters (via a county ballot measure) and its Boards of Supervisors by November 15, 2017. [S67] A board of 24 commissioners would also have been appointed to negotiate how to divide California's existing assets and liabilities among the new states. [S68] The initiative also explicitly stated that the Governor of California will be required to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress by January 1, 2018. [S69] In addition, California's charter counties would have been allowed more power over municipal affairs that currently may be controlled by city governments. [S70] This change was meant for the interim period between the passing of the initiative and congressional approval of the new states, but would have remained in place even if Congress did not pass the state-splitting proposal. [S71] In final section of the initiative, \"the official proponent of the initiative\" (Draper) was to be appointed as an \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal against legal challenges. [S72] ## Analysis\n\nPolitically, North California, Silicon Valley, West California, and to a lesser extent South California would lean Democratic, while Jefferson and especially Central California would be competitive.",
    "[S73] The California Legislative Analyst's Office, in a report that covered a wide variety of impacts, noted a wide disparity of incomes and tax bases in the proposed states. [S74] The report estimated that the state of Silicon Valley would have the nation's highest per capita personal income (PCPI) whereas the state of Central California would have the nation's lowest PCPI. [S75] During the two-year period between passage of the measure, the 24-member Commission would have had to decide how the California state resources would be divided and how the present debt would be distributed between the six states. [S76] The areas most affected would have been required to make decisions including school funding, health and social services, water management, and the handling of prisons. [S77] Each new state would have also been faced with new budgets, establishing methods of revenue, funding infrastructure, public employee compensation, and new, revised or discarded laws. [S78] Most likely, many issues would have had to be resolved by the courts. [S79] The Huffington Post further published a map detailing how splitting California would result in these separate rich states and poor states. [S80] Vikram Amar wrote a preliminary analysis of the difficulties that the Six Californias measure would face. [S81] His piece, published by the law group Justia, raised several constitutional questions on the proposal, including whether the people of a U.S. [S82] state can authorize such a split by popular initiative, and whether several new states can be validly created under Article IV by splitting the territory of a single existing state. [S83] Furthermore, Draper, as the appointed \"Agent of the State of California\" for the purpose of defending the proposal in court, may not actually be able to do so because of both the U.S. [S84] Supreme Court's ruling in *Hollingsworth v. [S85] Perry*; and Article II, Section 12, of the California Constitution that prohibits any constitutional amendment that names a specific individual to hold a particular office. [S86] Amar also wrote that the measure might be blocked by the California courts on grounds that it is a *revision* to the California constitution instead of an *amendment*. [S87] A proposed revision to the California constitution, a change that substantially alters the state's basic governmental framework, must originate from either the Legislature or a constitutional convention, not from a ballot initiative. [S88] A prior study by the state assembly report would allow for multistate reorganization of the university system, and any other present state function. [S89] It would be the job of the 24 member commission to decide. [S90] If the university system were to split, a report identified a potential increase in tuition for current Californians who attend a University of California campus, particularly residents in California's most northern state of Jefferson who would not have a single UC campus in the state. [S91] Based on the report's findings, Six Californias could result in over 60% of California students being classified as out-of-state, costing Californian families $2.5 billion more per year. [S92] California's prison system is also unequally spread out. [S93] If the prison system were to split, the new urban states of Silicon Valley and West California would each have to construct several new prisons since most of the current ones in California are located in the rural areas. [S94] California's current water and water rights issues would also have to have been resolved among the new states. [S95] The California, Hetch Hetchy, Los Angeles, Mokelumne, and other major aqueducts would cross the new state lines. [S96] If not reorganized into a multistate function, this would result in the new states of Silicon Valley and West California having to heavily rely on importing water from the other states.",
    "[S97] The report by the California Legislative Analyst's Office specifically named several other major issues that could have been affected by the decisions made by the leaders of each new state: crime, public safety and gun control/ownership; economic development; the environment; public employee pensions; laws related to marriage and family; taxes; and transportation and other infrastructure. [S98] Each new state could adopt different laws, either stricter or more lenient, on those issues than what California currently has on the books. [S99] These differing policies would have in turn eventually result in long-term demographic and economic changes, as various groups of people will want to migrate to those new states with laws more favorable to them. [S100] Vikram Amar agrees there are governance problems in California. [S101] The demographic, cultural, political and economic differences between the urban and rural areas of California are obvious, as are the tensions between the major urban areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles. [S102] However splitting California is a radical change, and a major question is whether the newly formed poorer states can make it without the tax revenues from the major metropolitan areas. [S103] The political makeup in Washington D.C. [S104] at the time of approval, may determine the success or failure of six Californias. [S105] Twelve Senators would result from six Californias, as well as a probable change in total house House seats and their electoral votes. [S106] According to Amar, \"we could expect four [Senators] (from Silicon Valley and West California) to consistently be Democrats, and four (from Jefferson and Central California) to lean Republican, with the other four (from Northern California and South California) harder to predict\". [S107] ## Stances on the proposal\n\n\n### Support\n\nTim Draper indicated that the initiative was motivated by the belief that California is ungovernable as is with legislature unable to keep up on issues in all the state's regions, especially in areas such as job creation, education, affordable housing, and water and transportation infrastructure. [S108] Furthermore, he believed that the current state government is getting out of touch with the people of California. [S109] According to Draper, splitting up the state would allow the resulting new state governments to be closer to their people than the current California state government. [S110] ### Opposition\n\nOneCalifornia, a bi-partisan committee to oppose the Six Californias ballot proposal, was formed in April 2014. [S111] It is co-chaired by Joe Rodota, former Cabinet Secretary for Governor Pete Wilson; and Steven Maviglio, former Press Secretary to Governor Gray Davis. [S112] The committee suggested that the initiative was damaging the state's image in the world economy. [S113] Rodota stated: \"Every day this measure marches its way toward the ballot it damages the California brand as the nation's economic powerhouse. [S114] It has negative implications that could cost California's businesses and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\" In an opinion piece in the *U-T San Diego*, Maviglio and Rodota wrote that if the measure passes, it \"will set in motion the most bureaucratic, costly, paper-pushing process in our history ... [S115] we'd spend years doing nothing more than rewriting laws, duplicating government offices, and spending billions of dollars unnecessarily.\" Furthermore, that it could increase the lobbying industry sixfold in California \"to deal with the flood of open questions\", and would be a burden on California businesses due to the increase of federal regulations regarding interstate commerce.",
    "[S116] The segregation of the incomes and tax bases led to criticism that the proposal is merely a money and political power grab for Silicon Valley and California's other wealthy areas. [S117] Phillip Bump of the *Washington Post* wrote that \"this entire plan is really about creating Silicon Valley as its own state. [S118] Therefore Silicon Valley gets to be a state called 'Silicon Valley,' and it gets to make its politics and its money more dense, and everyone in the idyllic dream of Silicon Valley gets to be happy.\"\n\nBrendan Nyhan said that the idea would be unlikely to pass Congress due to disruption it would cause in the political balance of the U.S. [S119] Senate, as well as other sticking points. [S120] Opponents said that the initiative was a thinly disguised Republican power play aimed at diminishing the electoral votes that have historically gone to Democrats in California. [S121] In a survey of the California congressional delegation, *The Hill* found that the Democrats opposed the proposition, while the Republicans were generally divided. [S122] Thus, a couple of political experts countered that the measure would not get the approval of all the parties needed; the voters would not necessarily wish to break up the state with the cost of setting up six new state governments and five new capitals, and Congress may not want five more states in the mix. [S123] ## Subsequent attempt\n\nA subsequent Draper initiative to divide California was launched in August 2017. [S124] The measure was titled by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra \"Division of California into Three States\", though it is commonly known as Cal 3. [S125] On June 13, 2018, it was announced that among the 600,000 signatures the initiative had received there were more than the 365,880 valid signatures needed, and the initiative would be put to the vote in November 2018. [S126] However, in July 2018, the California Supreme Court pulled it from the ballot for further state constitutional review."
