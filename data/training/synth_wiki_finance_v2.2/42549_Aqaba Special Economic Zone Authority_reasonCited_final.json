      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key components of ASEZA's master plan that balance economic development with environmental protection and how these reflect the authority's commitment to preserving Aqaba's cultural and natural heritage.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The master plan is mentioned in several sections. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the \"Master plan\" section. Sentence S7 says that in 2002, ASEZA adopted a comprehensive master plan covering development activities in the Zone for various sectors. That's a key component. Then, under the specific areas, there are five special areas: Aqaba Town, Port Areas, Coral Coastal Zone, Southern Industrial Zone, and Airport Industrial Zone. Each of these has details.\n\nFor Aqaba Town, S8 mentions that modern architecture complements traditional elements, creating a unique cultural environment and opportunities for investors in tourism, commercial, and residential areas. This shows balancing development with cultural preservation.\n\nPort Areas: S9 and S10 talk about merging port activities into a single expanded entertainment, residential, hotel, and cruise service center. While this is economic development, there's no direct mention of environmental protection here, but maybe the overall plan's goals include that.\n\nCoral Coastal Zone: S11 states that construction is happening with respect to beach and coral reef protection. That directly ties economic development (resort development) with environmental protection.\n\nSouthern Industrial Zone: S12 and S13 mention reorganized sites and new transportation systems like a railway. S15 says the Master Plan aims to preserve natural resources within the construction frame. S16 and S17 list areas like environmental zones, coral reserves, archaeological reserves, etc., which are for protecting heritage.\n\nAirport Industrial Zone: S14 lists permitted land uses but doesn't mention environmental aspects directly. However, the overall plan's mention in S15 and S16 about preserving natural resources and having specific reserves would apply here too.\n\nAdditionally, the Master Plan's mention of five environmental zones, coral reserves, archaeological reserves, natural area reserves, and a Beach Protection Zone in S17 shows specific components aimed at preserving heritage. These areas are part of the plan's structure to balance development with protection.\n\nSo the key components are the specific zones (Aqaba Town with cultural elements, Coral Coastal Zone with environmental protections, Southern Industrial Zone with transportation and reorganized sites, and the various reserves mentioned). The commitment to preserving heritage is shown through these designated zones and the emphasis on protecting natural and cultural sites while allowing development.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the comprehensive master plan is S7. The Aqaba Town part is S8. Coral Coastal Zone is S11. The environmental zones are S17. The preservation of natural resources is S15 and S16. Also, the mention of the five special areas in S8 and the specific zones in S17.\n\nI should structure the answer by listing each component with their respective citations. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags and citations are in <cite> with the correct numbers."
