      "question": "How do the regulatory requirements for companies in the Republic of Ireland differ from those in Northern Ireland, and what types of entities are included in the list despite not being formal companies?",
      "answer": "<statement>The regulatory requirements for companies in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland differ due to separate regulatory and registration authorities. Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, while companies in Northern Ireland must register with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. Additionally, certain Northern Ireland organizations are handled on a UK-wide basis by Companies House.<cite>[S4][S10][S11][S12]</cite></statement> <statement>The list includes statutory corporations, which are governed by boards appointed by an Irish Government minister under specific legislation, and are not formal companies but are included due to their size and economic significance. Mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included despite not being formal companies.<cite>[S13][S15]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n# List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of notable companies based in Ireland**, or subsidiaries according to their sector. [S2] It includes companies from the entire island. [S3] The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. [S4] Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities. [S5] ## About companies in Ireland\n\nIrish companies fall into three categories:\n\n* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix \"Limited\" (Ltd) or \"Teoranta\" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held. [S6] * Public limited companies, which carry the suffix \"plc\" or \"cpt\" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. [S7] Where this is the case, it is noted in this article. [S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies. [S9] Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the *Companies Acts*. [S10] Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. [S11] Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House. [S12] Some entries on this list may be *statutory corporations* - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. [S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. [S16] These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people. [S17] ## Largest firms\n\nThis list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. [S18] Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the regulatory requirements for companies in the Republic of Ireland differ from those in Northern Ireland, and what types of entities are included in the list even though they aren't formal companies.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have separate regulatory and registration authorities. Specifically, companies in the Republic must register with the Companies Registration Office, while those in Northern Ireland register with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. Also, some Northern Ireland organizations are handled by Companies House on a UK-wide basis. That's a key point for the first part of the question.\n\nNext, the second part about entities not being formal companies. The passage states that some entries are statutory corporations, which are governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under specific legislation. These aren't formal companies but are included because they're large businesses. Additionally, mutual bodies like building societies are also listed. There's also mention of subsidiaries of foreign companies, which are included because of their economic impact.\n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is backed by the correct citations. For the regulatory differences, sentences S4, S10, S11, and S12 are relevant. For the entities not being formal companies, sentences S13 and S15 are the ones that mention statutory corporations and mutual bodies. Also, S16 and S17 talk about subsidiaries, but the question specifically asks about entities not formal companies, so maybe S13 and S15 are the main ones.\n\nI should structure the answer into two parts: first explaining the regulatory differences with citations, then the types of entities included despite not being formal companies, again with citations. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with the appropriate citations in <cite> tags. Let me check the sentences again to ensure accuracy."

      "question": "What criteria determine the inclusion of multinational subsidiaries in the list of Irish companies, and how does this reflect Ireland's economic structure?",
      "answer": "<statement>The inclusion of multinational subsidiaries in the list of Irish companies is determined by their presence and operations within Ireland, regardless of ownership structure. This is explicitly stated in the passage, which notes that entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are included because they are significant contributors to the Irish economy.<cite>[S16]</cite></statement> <statement>This reflects Ireland's economic structure, as the country's economy is described as \"significantly dependent on foreign companies\" compared to other nations, with these subsidiaries serving as major employers and tax contributors. For example, Intel Ireland employs over 5,000 people, highlighting the critical role of multinational corporations in Ireland's economic framework.<cite>[S17]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n# List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of notable companies based in Ireland**, or subsidiaries according to their sector. [S2] It includes companies from the entire island. [S3] The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. [S4] Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities. [S5] ## About companies in Ireland\n\nIrish companies fall into three categories:\n\n* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix \"Limited\" (Ltd) or \"Teoranta\" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held. [S6] * Public limited companies, which carry the suffix \"plc\" or \"cpt\" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. [S7] Where this is the case, it is noted in this article. [S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies. [S9] Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the *Companies Acts*. [S10] Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. [S11] Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House. [S12] Some entries on this list may be *statutory corporations* - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. [S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. [S16] These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people. [S17] ## Largest firms\n\nThis list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. [S18] Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample. [S19] | Rank | Image | Name | 2016 revenues (US$M) | Employees | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 272 | Johnson Controls | 37,674 | 209,000 | Multinational industrial conglomerate manufacturing electronics for the automotive industry and commercial electrical equipment. [S20] After a full merger with Tyco International in 2016, the firm established headquarters in Cork, Ireland. [S21] |\n| 305 | Accenture | 34,798 | 384,000 | Global professional services and management consulting firm. [S22] The company formed as a spin-off from the U.S.-based Arthur Andersen in 1989 and moved their headquarters to Dublin in 2009. [S23] Accenture's clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. [S24] |\n| 363 | CRH plc | 29,973 | 86,778 | Diversified building materials and construction holding company. [S25] The firm provides heavyside products and materials (cement, aggregates and concrete), lightside products (glass, fencing), and retail product distribution (merchant chains). [S26] |\n| 377 | Medtronic | 28,833 | 98,017 | Multinational medical device design, development and manufacturing. [S27] company. [S28] After acquiring Dublin-based Covidien in 2014, the firm moved their headquarters from the United States to Ireland while retaining operational headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota. [S29] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S30] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S31] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S32] Notable companies\nStatus: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\n| Name | Industry | Sector

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the criteria for including multinational subsidiaries in the list of Irish companies and how this reflects Ireland's economic structure. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions that some entries are subsidiaries of foreign companies, like Three Ireland and Intel Ireland. The key part here is sentence S16, which states that these subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies. Then, S17 adds that these multinationals are major employers and tax contributors, using Intel Ireland as an example.\n\nSo the criteria for inclusion seem to be the presence of the subsidiary in Ireland, regardless of ownership. The reflection on the economy is that Ireland relies heavily on these foreign companies, which contribute a lot through employment and taxes. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention criteria. The passage also talks about the list including companies from the entire island, but that's more about geographical coverage. The categories of companies (private, public, etc.) don't directly relate to multinational subsidiaries. \n\nTherefore, the main citations would be S16 and S17. I need to structure the answer with these citations. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations."

        "[S1] List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n# List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of notable companies based in Ireland**, or subsidiaries according to their sector. [S2] It includes companies from the entire island. [S3] The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. [S4] Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities. [S5] ## About companies in Ireland\n\nIrish companies fall into three categories:\n\n* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix \"Limited\" (Ltd) or \"Teoranta\" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held. [S6] * Public limited companies, which carry the suffix \"plc\" or \"cpt\" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. [S7] Where this is the case, it is noted in this article. [S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies. [S9] Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the *Companies Acts*. [S10] Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. [S11] Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House. [S12] Some entries on this list may be *statutory corporations* - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. [S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. [S16] These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people. [S17] ## Largest firms\n\nThis list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. [S18] Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample. [S19] | Rank | Image | Name | 2016 revenues (US$M) | Employees | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 272 | Johnson Controls | 37,674 | 209,000 | Multinational industrial conglomerate manufacturing electronics for the automotive industry and commercial electrical equipment. [S20] After a full merger with Tyco International in 2016, the firm established headquarters in Cork, Ireland. [S21] |\n| 305 | Accenture | 34,798 | 384,000 | Global professional services and management consulting firm. [S22] The company formed as a spin-off from the U.S.-based Arthur Andersen in 1989 and moved their headquarters to Dublin in 2009. [S23] Accenture's clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. [S24] |\n| 363 | CRH plc | 29,973 | 86,778 | Diversified building materials and construction holding company. [S25] The firm provides heavyside products and materials (cement, aggregates and concrete), lightside products (glass, fencing), and retail product distribution (merchant chains). [S26] |\n| 377 | Medtronic | 28,833 | 98,017 | Multinational medical device design, development and manufacturing. [S27] company. [S28] After acquiring Dublin-based Covidien in 2014, the firm moved their headquarters from the United States to Ireland while retaining operational headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota. [S29] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S30] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S31] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how defunct companies are represented in the list and wants examples from the table. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage mentions that organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. That's a key point. Then, in Passage 2, there's a table with a \"Status\" column that includes \"D\" for Defunct.\n\nLooking at the table, I should scan through the \"Status\" column to find entries marked as D. For example, Covidien is listed with Status D and a note that it merged with Medtronic in 2016. Another entry is C\u00faram Software, which was acquired by IBM and has a D status. There's also IONA Technologies, which was acquired by Progress Software in 2008, marked as D. \n\nAdditionally, Oatfield is noted as defunct with the brand now part of Zed Candy. Thomas Crosbie Holdings is defunct since 2013. Smart Telecom is defunct since 2011, and Stobart Air is defunct as of 2021. \n\nI need to make sure each example is correctly cited with the respective sentence numbers. The passage mentions defunct companies in S30 and S31, but the specific examples are in the table. Each entry in the table would have their own citations based on the passage. For instance, Covidien's entry is in S30, but the status is in the table. Wait, the table itself is part of Passage 2, so the citations for the table entries would be from S32 onwards. However, the user's question is about how they're represented, which is explained in the text, and the examples are in the table. \n\nSo the answer should state that defunct companies are noted with \"D\" in the Status column and provide examples from the table with their citations. Each example's citation would be the specific row in the table, but since the table is part of Passage 2, the citations would be from S32 onwards. However, the exact sentence numbers for each entry might not be specified. Wait, the user's supporting context has Passage 1 and Passage 2. The table in Passage 2 is under S32. So each entry in the table would be part of S32. But the user's instructions say to cite the sentence numbers from the supporting context. \n\nLooking back, the passage numbers are S1 to S31 for Passage 1 and S32 onwards for Passage 2. The table in Passage 2 is under S32. However, the actual entries in the table might not have individual sentence numbers. But the user's example shows that each statement is a sentence from the passage. Since the table is part of the passage, the entries in the table are part of the text. However, the way the supporting context is structured, each row in the table might not be a separate sentence. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's example shows that each sentence in the passage is numbered, but the table entries are part of the passage. So perhaps the entries in the table are considered part of the passage's text. For example, the row for Covidien is part of the table under S32. But the exact citation would be S32, but that's the entire passage. Alternatively, maybe each row in the table is considered a separate sentence. However, the original passage's structure isn't clear on that. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest approach is to cite the passage where the table is located, which is S32. However, the user's example shows that each sentence in the passage is numbered. Since the table is part of the passage, the entries in the table would be part of the text. But without specific sentence numbers for each table entry, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, the user might expect that the examples are cited based on the passage where they are mentioned. For instance, the mention of defunct companies in the text is in S30 and S31. The examples in the table would be cited as S32 (since the table is under S32). But this might not be accurate. \n\nGiven the instructions, I'll proceed by citing the relevant sentences from the passage that mention defunct companies and then the table entries as part of S32. However, since the table is part of the passage, each entry's citation would be S32. But that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, the user might expect that each example's citation is the specific row in the table. But since the table isn't broken down into individual sentences, perhaps the answer should cite S32 for the table and then mention the specific entries. However, the user's example shows that each sentence in the passage is cited. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer should state that defunct companies are marked with \"D\" in the Status column, and examples include Covidien (S30), C\u00faram Software (S30), IONA Technologies (S30), Oatfield (S30), Thomas Crosbie Holdings (S30), Smart Telecom (S30), and Stobart Air (S30). But I need to check the actual passage. \n\nLooking back, the passage mentions in S30: \"Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.\" Then, in the table under S32, the Status column has D for defunct. So the examples in the table are part of S32. Therefore, each example's citation would be S32. However, the user's example shows that each sentence is cited. Since the table is part of the passage, each entry in the table is part of the text. But without individual sentence numbers for each table entry, it's difficult. \n\nPerhaps the answer should cite S30 for the general statement and S32 for the table. But the user's instructions require citations for each sentence. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the information available, citing S30 for the general mention and S32 for the table examples."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n# List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of notable companies based in Ireland**, or subsidiaries according to their sector. [S2] It includes companies from the entire island. [S3] The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. [S4] Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities. [S5] ## About companies in Ireland\n\nIrish companies fall into three categories:\n\n* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix \"Limited\" (Ltd) or \"Teoranta\" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held. [S6] * Public limited companies, which carry the suffix \"plc\" or \"cpt\" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. [S7] Where this is the case, it is noted in this article. [S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies. [S9] Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the *Companies Acts*. [S10] Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. [S11] Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House. [S12] Some entries on this list may be *statutory corporations* - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. [S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. [S16] These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people. [S17] ## Largest firms\n\nThis list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. [S18] Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample. [S19] | Rank | Image | Name | 2016 revenues (US$M) | Employees | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 272 | Johnson Controls | 37,674 | 209,000 | Multinational industrial conglomerate manufacturing electronics for the automotive industry and commercial electrical equipment. [S20] After a full merger with Tyco International in 2016, the firm established headquarters in Cork, Ireland. [S21] |\n| 305 | Accenture | 34,798 | 384,000 | Global professional services and management consulting firm. [S22] The company formed as a spin-off from the U.S.-based Arthur Andersen in 1989 and moved their headquarters to Dublin in 2009. [S23] Accenture's clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. [S24] |\n| 363 | CRH plc | 29,973 | 86,778 | Diversified building materials and construction holding company. [S25] The firm provides heavyside products and materials (cement, aggregates and concrete), lightside products (glass, fencing), and retail product distribution (merchant chains). [S26] |\n| 377 | Medtronic | 28,833 | 98,017 | Multinational medical device design, development and manufacturing. [S27] company. [S28] After acquiring Dublin-based Covidien in 2014, the firm moved their headquarters from the United States to Ireland while retaining operational headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota. [S29] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S30] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S31] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S32] Notable companies\nStatus: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\n| Name | Industry | Sector

        "[S1] List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n# List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of notable companies based in Ireland**, or subsidiaries according to their sector. [S2] It includes companies from the entire island. [S3] The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. [S4] Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities. [S5] ## About companies in Ireland\n\nIrish companies fall into three categories:\n\n* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix \"Limited\" (Ltd) or \"Teoranta\" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held. [S6] * Public limited companies, which carry the suffix \"plc\" or \"cpt\" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. [S7] Where this is the case, it is noted in this article. [S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies. [S9] Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the *Companies Acts*. [S10] Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. [S11] Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House. [S12] Some entries on this list may be *statutory corporations* - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. [S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. [S16] These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people. [S17] ## Largest firms\n\nThis list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. [S18] Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample.

[S22] The company formed as a spin-off from the U.S.-based Arthur Andersen in 1989 and moved their headquarters to Dublin in 2009. [S23] Accenture's clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. [S24] |\n| 363 | CRH plc | 29,973 | 86,778 | Diversified building materials and construction holding company.

[S26] |\n| 377 | Medtronic | 28,833 | 98,017 | Multinational medical device design, development and manufacturing. [S27] company. [S28] After acquiring Dublin-based Covidien in 2014, the firm moved their headquarters from the United States to Ireland while retaining operational headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota. [S29] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S30] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S31] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the Fortune Global 500 ranking relates to the companies listed in the table and wants examples from the table that align with this ranking.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The passage mentions a section titled \"Largest firms\" which includes a table with companies from the Fortune Global 500. The note says that only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample. The table lists companies like Johnson Controls, Accenture, CRH plc, and Medtronic, each with their ranks, revenues, employees, and notes.\n\nSo, the relation here is that the table in the \"Largest firms\" section includes companies that are part of the Fortune Global 500 ranking. The ranking is based on total revenues as of March 2017. The examples would be the companies listed in that table. \n\nNow, checking the citations. The sentence that mentions the Fortune Global 500 is [S18], and the note about including top five firms is [S19]. The table itself has entries with details, and each entry has its own citations. For example, Johnson Controls has [S20] and [S21], Accenture has [S22]-[S24], CRH plc has [S25]-[S26], and Medtronic has [S27]-[S29]. \n\nI need to make sure that the answer correctly cites the relevant sentences. The main points are the connection between the table and the Fortune Global 500, and the examples given. Each example company should be linked to their respective citations. Also, the general mention of the ranking's criteria (revenues before 31 March 2017) is in [S18]. \n\nI should structure the answer by first stating the relation, then listing the examples with their citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the appropriate citations. For instance, when mentioning the Fortune Global 500, cite [S18] and [S19]. For each company, cite their specific entries."
