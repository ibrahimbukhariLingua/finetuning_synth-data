      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the Permanent Settlement in making village societies vulnerable to market forces and how that compares to the ryotwari system in southern India.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and find the relevant sentences. Let me start by scanning the text for mentions of the Permanent Settlement and its effects. \n\nLooking at the sentences, S36 says that commercialized cultivation had penetrated deeper into village society, making them more vulnerable to market forces. That seems directly related to the first part of the question. Then, S37 mentions that zamindars couldn't meet the Company's demands, leading to land auctions. S39 talks about zamindars becoming rentiers, which might indicate they weren't actively managing the land, possibly leading to vulnerability. \n\nNow, for the ryotwari system, S43 and S44 discuss how it involved direct settlement with peasants, avoiding large landowners. S45 mentions the theory behind ryotwari, based on Ricardo's Law of Rent, and S47 explains the assessment of plots and taxation. The passage also notes in S49 that despite the system's principles, village hierarchies remained, and peasants sometimes couldn't meet demands. However, compared to the Permanent Settlement, the ryotwari might have less vulnerability because peasants were directly dealing with the government, not intermediaries like zamindars. \n\nWait, the question is about vulnerability to market forces. The Permanent Settlement's impact is mentioned in S36, making villages more vulnerable. For ryotwari, the passage doesn't explicitly say it made them less vulnerable, but maybe the structure of direct taxation without intermediaries could be different. However, the passage does mention that in ryotwari, peasants still faced issues (S49), but maybe not as directly tied to market forces as the Permanent Settlement. \n\nSo, the answer would need to connect the Permanent Settlement's role in increasing vulnerability through commercialization and zamindar defaults, leading to auctioned lands and rentier classes. For ryotwari, the comparison is that it bypassed intermediaries, but still had challenges. The citations would be S36, S37, S39 for the Permanent Settlement, and S43-S47 for ryotwari. But need to check which sentences specifically compare the two. \n\nWait, the passage doesn't directly compare the two systems' vulnerability to market forces, but explains their structures. The question is about how the Permanent Settlement's role in vulnerability compares to ryotwari's outcomes. The passage says that in ryotwari, the government dealt directly with ryots, which might have made them less vulnerable compared to the zamindari system where intermediaries (zamindars) were involved. However, the passage also mentions that in ryotwari, peasants still faced issues. \n\nSo, the answer would state that the Permanent Settlement made villages more vulnerable by deepening commercialization and creating a rentier class, while ryotwari aimed to reduce this by direct taxation but still had challenges. The citations would be S36 for the vulnerability part, and S43-S47 for the ryotwari system's structure. Also, S49 mentions that peasants in ryotwari still had issues, but maybe not as directly linked to market forces as the Permanent Settlement. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. Let me structure the answer with two sentences: one about the Permanent Settlement's role and citations, another about ryotwari's comparison and citations."

Let me scan the passage for mentions of James Mill and the ryotwari system. \n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section that says: \"At the heart of the ryotwari system was a particular theory of economic rent\u2014and based on David Ricardo's Law of Rent\u2014promoted by utilitarian James Mill who formulated the Indian revenue policy between 1819 and 1830.\" That seems to directly answer the first part about Mill's influence. Then it mentions that Mill believed the government should take the rent, which is the profit from richer soil after expenses. Another part says Mill advocated ryotwari settlements with government measurement and taxation based on soil fertility. So those are the theoretical influences.\n\nNow for the practical challenges. The passage mentions that despite the system's principles, class hierarchies remained. For example, village headmen still had power, and peasants sometimes couldn't meet revenue demands. Also, there was a scandal in the 1850s where revenue agents used torture to meet demands. Additionally, the ryotwari system's implementation might have faced issues like the government's ability to enforce measurements and assessments, but the text specifically points out the persistence of local hierarchies and the difficulty peasants had with payments. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The sentences about James Mill are [S45] and [S46], and [S47]. The practical challenges are mentioned in [S49] and [S50]. Let me check again. \n\nYes, [S45] talks about Mill's theory based on Ricardo's Law of Rent. [S46] explains his belief about the government taking rent. [S47] mentions Mill's advocacy for ryotwari with measurements. For challenges, [S49] says class hierarchies remained and peasants couldn't meet demands.

      "answer": "<statement>The East India Company's reliance on land revenue as a primary income source, despite running debts in 33 out of 45 years between 1814 and 1859, highlights its economic instability. Land revenue became the single most important source of government revenue, accounting for roughly half of overall revenue in the mid-19th century, yet the government of India still faced deficits in 33 years during this period. This suggests that land revenue alone was insufficient to ensure financial stability, as even non-deficit years barely covered minimal administrative costs, such as salaries for a limited police force and army. <cite>[S53][S54]</cite></statement><statement>The Company's financial struggles, coupled with its reliance on land revenue, likely exacerbated governance challenges. For instance, the coercive practices tied to land settlements, such as forcing peasants to grow indigo under the Permanent Settlement, led to social unrest, as seen in the Indigo Rebellion of 1859\u201360. This rebellion underscores how economic policies based on land revenue and exploitative agricultural practices undermined the Company's ability to maintain stable governance in India. <cite>[S75][S52]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S67] At this time, the East India Company's trade with China began to grow as well. [S68] In the early 19th century demand for Chinese tea had greatly increased in Britain; since the money supply in India was restricted and the Company was indisposed to shipping bullion from Britain, it decided upon opium, which had a large underground market in China and which was grown in many parts of India, as the most profitable form of payment. [S69] However, since the Chinese authorities had banned the importation and consumption of opium, the Company engaged them in the First Opium War, and at its conclusion, under the Treaty of Nanjing, gained access to five Chinese ports, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo; in addition, Hong Kong was ceded to the British Crown. [S70] Towards the end of the second quarter of the 19th century, opium export constituted 40% of India's exports. [S71] Another major, though erratic, export item was indigo dye, which was extracted from natural indigo, and which came to be grown in Bengal and northern Bihar. [S72] In 1788, the East India Company offered advances to ten British planters to grow indigo; however, since the new (landed) property rights defined in the Permanent Settlement, didn't allow them, as Europeans, to buy agricultural land, they had to in turn offer cash advances to local peasants, and sometimes coerce them, to grow the crop. [S73] In early 19th century Europe, blue apparel was favoured as a fashion, particularly amongst African Slavers, North American Colonists, and for some military uniforms; consequently, the demand for the dye was high. [S74] The European demand for the dye, however, proved to be unstable, and both creditors and cultivators bore the risk of the market crashes in 1827 and 1847. [S75] The peasant discontent in Bengal eventually led to the *Indigo rebellion* in 1859\u201360 and to the end of indigo production there. [S76] In Bihar, however, indigo production continued well into the 20th century; a centre of indigo production there, Champaran district, became an early testing ground, in 1917, for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's strategy of non-violent resistance against the British Raj.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S51] Land revenue settlements constituted a major administrative activity of the various governments in India under Company rule. [S52] In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted a large proportion of the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. [S53] After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. [S54] With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just enough money to pay the salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army. [S55] ## Trade\n\nFrom the first voyages of the Company in the early 1600s it had traditionally imported bullion to both hire local Indian employees, across its network of factories, and for the purchase of Indian trade goods, either to be bartered on for Slaves, or sold in the European and American colonies. [S56] Prasannan Parthasarathi estimates that 28,000 tonnes of bullion (mainly from the New World) flowed into the Indian subcontinent between 1600 and 1800, equating to 30% of the world's production in the period. [S57] Studies have also shown approximately 5% of these voyages failed, Company records showing of the 2,171 voyages, between the mid 18th century, and 1813, 105 were lost to enemy action, foundering, or wrecking, resulting in the loss of treasure and goods. [S58] Export of Bullion to India, by EIC (1708\u20131810)\n| Years | Bullion (\u00a3) | Average per Annum |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1708/9-1733/4 | 12,189,147 | 420,315 |\n| 1734/5-1759/60 | 15,239,115 | 586,119 |\n| 1760/1-1765/6 | 842,381 | 140,396 |\n| 1766/7-1771/2 | 968,289 | 161,381 |\n| 1772/3-1775/6 | 72,911 | 18,227 |\n| 1776/7-1784/5 | 156,106 | 17,345 |\n| 1785/6-1792/3 | 4,476,207 | 559,525 |\n| 1793/4-1809/10 | 8,988,165 | 528,715 |\n\nAfter gaining the right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the East India Company temporarily decreased the volume of gold and silver it was importing annually into India. [S59] In addition, as under Mughal rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. [S60] Consequently, in the period 1760\u20131800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardization of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. [S61] During the period, 1780\u20131860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. [S62] More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. [S63] Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. [S64] Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in\u2014and soon to inundate\u2014the Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from \u00a35.2 million in 1850 to \u00a318.4 million in 1896. [S65] The American Civil War too would have a major impact on India's cotton economy: with the outbreak of the war, American cotton was no longer available to British manufacturers; consequently, demand for Indian cotton soared, and the prices soon quadrupled. [S66] This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy.",

        "[S51] Land revenue settlements constituted a major administrative activity of the various governments in India under Company rule. [S52] In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted a large proportion of the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. [S53] After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. [S54] With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just enough money to pay the salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army. [S55] ## Trade\n\nFrom the first voyages of the Company in the early 1600s it had traditionally imported bullion to both hire local Indian employees, across its network of factories, and for the purchase of Indian trade goods, either to be bartered on for Slaves, or sold in the European and American colonies. [S56] Prasannan Parthasarathi estimates that 28,000 tonnes of bullion (mainly from the New World) flowed into the Indian subcontinent between 1600 and 1800, equating to 30% of the world's production in the period. [S57] Studies have also shown approximately 5% of these voyages failed, Company records showing of the 2,171 voyages, between the mid 18th century, and 1813, 105 were lost to enemy action, foundering, or wrecking, resulting in the loss of treasure and goods. [S58] Export of Bullion to India, by EIC (1708\u20131810)\n| Years | Bullion (\u00a3) | Average per Annum |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1708/9-1733/4 | 12,189,147 | 420,315 |\n| 1734/5-1759/60 | 15,239,115 | 586,119 |\n| 1760/1-1765/6 | 842,381 | 140,396 |\n| 1766/7-1771/2 | 968,289 | 161,381 |\n| 1772/3-1775/6 | 72,911 | 18,227 |\n| 1776/7-1784/5 | 156,106 | 17,345 |\n| 1785/6-1792/3 | 4,476,207 | 559,525 |\n| 1793/4-1809/10 | 8,988,165 | 528,715 |\n\nAfter gaining the right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the East India Company temporarily decreased the volume of gold and silver it was importing annually into India. [S59] In addition, as under Mughal rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. [S60] Consequently, in the period 1760\u20131800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardization of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. [S61] During the period, 1780\u20131860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. [S62] More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. [S63] Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. [S64] Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in\u2014and soon to inundate\u2014the Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from \u00a35.2 million in 1850 to \u00a318.4 million in 1896. [S65] The American Civil War too would have a major impact on India's cotton economy: with the outbreak of the war, American cotton was no longer available to British manufacturers; consequently, demand for Indian cotton soared, and the prices soon quadrupled. [S66] This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the East India Company's reliance on land revenue as a primary income source, despite running debts in 33 out of 45 years between 1814 and 1859, affected its economic stability and governance in India.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Let me scan through them to find relevant information.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a mention that land revenue became the single most important source of government revenue, about half of overall revenue in the mid-19th century. However, between 1814 and 1859, the government ran debts in 33 years. That's a key point. Also, it says that even during non-deficit years, there was just enough money for basic administration, police, and army. So relying on land revenue didn't prevent debts, which suggests economic instability.\n\nAnother part in Passage 2 talks about the Company losing trading rights and becoming dependent on land revenue. The debts despite this reliance indicate that land revenue wasn't sufficient to cover expenses, leading to financial instability. The fact that they had to manage with minimal funds for administration might have affected governance, maybe leading to inefficiencies or reliance on other revenue sources like opium and indigo, which are mentioned in Passage 1.\n\nAlso, the Indigo rebellion in 1859-60 from Passage 1 shows that the economic policies, including land revenue and forced cultivation, led to peasant discontent. This could tie into governance issues, as rebellions would challenge the Company's control.\n\nSo, the impact on economic stability is that despite land revenue being a major income, the Company still had many deficit years, indicating instability. For governance, the reliance on land revenue and other exploitative practices (like coercing peasants for indigo) led to social unrest, which would undermine effective governance. The citations needed would be from Passage 2, specifically [S53] and [S54], and maybe [S52] about land settlements. Also, the Indigo rebellion in [S75] could be relevant for governance impact.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing these sources. Make sure each sentence has the correct citations. Check if other parts of the context add more info. The trade section in Passage 2 mentions bullion and exports, but the question is about land revenue. So focus on the parts where land revenue is discussed in relation to debts and governance."

    "[S1] Economy of India under Company rule\n\n\n# Economy of India under Company rule\n\n\n\nThe **Economy of India under Company rule** describes the economy of those regions that fell under Company rule in India during the years 1757 to 1858. [S2] The British East India Company began ruling parts of the Indian subcontinent beginning with the Battle of Plassey, which led to the conquest of Bengal Subah and the founding of the Bengal Presidency, before the Company expanded across most of the subcontinent up until the Indian Rebellion of 1857. [S3] ## Economic impact\n\nA number of historians point to the colonization of India as a major factor in both India's deindustrialization and Britain's Industrial Revolution. [S4] The capital amassed from Bengal following its 1757 conquest helped to invest in British industries such as textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution as well as increase British wealth, while contributing to deindustrialization in Bengal. [S5] British colonization forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without any tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while in Britain protectionist policies such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian textiles from being sold there, whereas raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold them back to the Indian market. [S6] British economic policies gave them a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources. [S7] India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods. [S8] Indian textiles had maintained a competitive advantage over British textiles up until the 19th century, when Britain eventually overtook India as the world's largest cotton textile manufacturer. [S9] In 1811, Bengal was still a major exporter of cotton cloth to the Americas and the Indian Ocean. [S10] However, Bengali exports declined over the course of the early 19th century, as British imports to Bengal increased, from 25% in 1811 to 93% in 1840. [S11] India, which was previously the world's largest economy under the Mughal Empire in 1700, had by 1820 fallen to become the second largest economy, behind Qing China. [S12] ## Land revenue\n\nIn the remnant of the Mughal revenue system existing in pre-1765 Bengal, zamindars, or \"land holders,\" collected revenue on behalf of the Mughal emperor, whose representative, or diwan supervised their activities. [S13] In this system, the assortment of rights associated with land were not possessed by a \"land owner,\" but rather shared by the several parties with stake in the land, including the peasant cultivator, the *zamindar*, and the state. [S14] The *zamindar* served as an intermediary who procured economic rent from the cultivator, and after withholding a percentage for his own expenses, made available the rest, as revenue to the state. [S15] Under the Mughal system, the land itself belonged to the state and not to the *zamindar*, who could transfer only his right to collect rent. [S16] On being awarded the *diwani* or overlordship of Bengal following the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the East India Company found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law; tax collection was consequently left in the hands of the existing hereditary collectors. [S17] This uncertain foray into land taxation by the Company, may have gravely worsened the impact of a famine that struck Bengal in 1769\u201370 in which between seven and ten million people\u2014or between a quarter and third of the presidency's population\u2014may have died. [S18] However, the company provided little relief either through reduced taxation or by relief efforts, and the economic and cultural impact of the famine was felt decades later, even becoming, a century later, the subject of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's novel *Anandamath*.",
    "[S19] In 1772, under Warren Hastings, the East India Company took over revenue collection directly in the Bengal Presidency (then Bengal and Bihar), establishing a Board of Revenue with offices in Calcutta and Patna, and moving the existing Mughal revenue records from Murshidabad to Calcutta. [S20] In 1773, after Oudh ceded the tributary state of Benaras, the revenue collection system was extended to the territory with a Company Resident in charge. [S21] The following year\u2014with a view to preventing corruption\u2014Company *district collectors*, who were then responsible for revenue collection for an entire district, were replaced with provincial councils at Patna, Murshidabad and Calcutta and with Indian collectors working within each district. [S22] The title, \"collector,\" reflected \"the centrality of land revenue collection to government in India: it was the government's primary function and it moulded the institutions and patterns of administration.\"\n\nThe Company inherited a revenue collection system from the Mughals in which the heaviest proportion of the tax burden fell on the cultivators, with one-third of the production reserved for imperial entitlement; this pre-colonial system became the Company revenue policy's baseline. [S23] There was vast variation across India in the methods by which the revenues were collected; with this complication in mind, a Committee of Circuit toured the districts of expanded Bengal presidency in order to make a five-year settlement, consisting of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farming. [S24] In their overall approach to revenue policy, Company officials were guided by two goals: preserving as much as possible the balance of rights and obligations that were traditionally claimed by the farmers who cultivated the land and the various intermediaries who collected tax on the state's behalf and who reserved a cut for themselves and identifying those sectors of the rural economy that would maximize both revenue and security. [S25] Although their first revenue settlement turned out to be essentially the same as the more informal previous Mughal one, the Company had created a foundation for the growth of both information and bureaucracy. [S26] In 1793, the new Governor-General, Lord Cornwallis, promulgated the permanent settlement of land revenues in the presidency, the first socio-economic regulation in colonial India. [S27] It was named *permanent* because it fixed the land tax in perpetuity in return for landed property rights for zamindars; it simultaneously defined the nature of land ownership in the presidency and gave individuals and families separate property rights in occupied land. [S28] Since the revenue was fixed in perpetuity, it was fixed at a high level, which in Bengal amounted to \u00a33 million at 1789\u201390 prices. [S29] According to one estimate, this was 20% higher than the revenue demand before 1757. [S30] Over the next century, partly as a result of land surveys, court rulings and property sales, the change was given practical dimension. [S31] An influence on the development of this revenue policy were economic theories which regarded agriculture as the engine of economic development and consequently stressed the fixing of revenue demands in order to encourage growth. [S32] The expectation behind the permanent settlement was that knowledge of a fixed government demand would encourage the zamindars to increase both their average outcrop and the land under cultivation, since they would be able to retain the profits from the increased output; in addition, it was envisaged that land would become a marketable form of property that could be purchased, sold or mortgaged. [S33] A feature of this economic rationale was the additional expectation that the zamindars, recognizing their own best interest, would not make unreasonable demands on the peasantry.",
    "[S34] However, these expectations were not realised in practice and in many regions of Bengal, the peasants bore the brunt of the increased demand, there being little protection for their traditional rights in the new legislation. [S35] Forced labor of the peasants by the zamindars became more prevalent as cash crops were cultivated to meet the Company revenue demands. [S36] Although commercialized cultivation was not new to the region, it had now penetrated deeper into village society and made it more vulnerable to market forces. [S37] The zamindars themselves were often unable to meet the increased demands that the Company had placed on them; consequently, many defaulted, and by one estimate, up to one-third of their lands were auctioned during the first three decades following the permanent settlement. [S38] The new owners were often Brahmin and Kayastha employees of the Company who had a good grasp of the new system, and in many cases, had prospered under it. [S39] Since the zamindars were never able to undertake costly improvements to the land envisaged under the Permanent Settlement, some of which required the removal of the existing farmers, they soon became rentiers who lived off the rent from their tenant farmers. [S40] In many areas, especially northern Bengal, they had to increasingly share the revenue with intermediate tenure holders, called Jotedar, who supervised farming in the villages. [S41] Consequently, unlike the contemporaneous Enclosure movement in Britain, agriculture in Bengal remained the province of the subsistence farming of innumerable small paddy fields. [S42] The zamindari system was one of two principal revenue settlements undertaken by the Company in India. [S43] In southern India, Thomas Munro, who would later become Governor of Madras, promoted the *ryotwari* system, in which the government settled land-revenue directly with the peasant farmers, or *ryots*. [S44] This was, in part, a consequence of the turmoil of the Anglo-Mysore Wars, which had prevented the emergence of a class of large landowners; in addition, Munro and others felt that *ryotwari* was closer to traditional practice in the region and ideologically more progressive, allowing the benefits of Company rule to reach the lowest levels of rural society. [S45] At the heart of the *ryotwari* system was a particular theory of economic rent\u2014and based on David Ricardo's Law of Rent\u2014promoted by utilitarian James Mill who formulated the Indian revenue policy between 1819 and 1830. [S46] \"He believed that the government was the ultimate lord of the soil and should not renounce its right to 'rent', *i.e.* the profit left over on richer soil when wages and other working expenses had been settled.\" Another keystone of the new system of temporary settlements was the classification of agricultural fields according to soil type and produce, with average rent rates fixed for the period of the settlement. [S47] According to Mill, taxation of land rent would promote efficient agriculture and simultaneously prevent the emergence of a \"parasitic landlord class.\" Mill advocated *ryotwari* settlements which consisted of government measurement and assessment of each plot (valid for 20 or 30 years) and subsequent taxation which was dependent on the fertility of the soil. [S48] The taxed amount was nine-tenths of the \"rent\" in the early 19th century and gradually fell afterwards. [S49] However, in spite of the appeal of the *ryotwari* system's abstract principles, class hierarchies in southern Indian villages had not entirely disappeared\u2014for example village headmen continued to hold sway\u2014and peasant cultivators sometimes came to experience revenue demands they could not meet. [S50] In the 1850s, a scandal erupted when it was discovered that some Indian revenue agents of the Company were using torture to meet the Company's revenue demands.",
    "[S51] Land revenue settlements constituted a major administrative activity of the various governments in India under Company rule. [S52] In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted a large proportion of the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. [S53] After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. [S54] With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just enough money to pay the salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army. [S55] ## Trade\n\nFrom the first voyages of the Company in the early 1600s it had traditionally imported bullion to both hire local Indian employees, across its network of factories, and for the purchase of Indian trade goods, either to be bartered on for Slaves, or sold in the European and American colonies. [S56] Prasannan Parthasarathi estimates that 28,000 tonnes of bullion (mainly from the New World) flowed into the Indian subcontinent between 1600 and 1800, equating to 30% of the world's production in the period. [S57] Studies have also shown approximately 5% of these voyages failed, Company records showing of the 2,171 voyages, between the mid 18th century, and 1813, 105 were lost to enemy action, foundering, or wrecking, resulting in the loss of treasure and goods.

[S59] In addition, as under Mughal rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the Company's wars in other parts of India. [S60] Consequently, in the period 1760\u20131800, Bengal's money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardization of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. [S61] During the period, 1780\u20131860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. [S62] More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India's exports. [S63] Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. [S64] Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in\u2014and soon to inundate\u2014the Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from \u00a35.2 million in 1850 to \u00a318.4 million in 1896.

[S66] This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy.",
    "[S67] At this time, the East India Company's trade with China began to grow as well. [S68] In the early 19th century demand for Chinese tea had greatly increased in Britain; since the money supply in India was restricted and the Company was indisposed to shipping bullion from Britain, it decided upon opium, which had a large underground market in China and which was grown in many parts of India, as the most profitable form of payment. [S69] However, since the Chinese authorities had banned the importation and consumption of opium, the Company engaged them in the First Opium War, and at its conclusion, under the Treaty of Nanjing, gained access to five Chinese ports, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo; in addition, Hong Kong was ceded to the British Crown. [S70] Towards the end of the second quarter of the 19th century, opium export constituted 40% of India's exports. [S71] Another major, though erratic, export item was indigo dye, which was extracted from natural indigo, and which came to be grown in Bengal and northern Bihar. [S72] In 1788, the East India Company offered advances to ten British planters to grow indigo; however, since the new (landed) property rights defined in the Permanent Settlement, didn't allow them, as Europeans, to buy agricultural land, they had to in turn offer cash advances to local peasants, and sometimes coerce them, to grow the crop. [S73] In early 19th century Europe, blue apparel was favoured as a fashion, particularly amongst African Slavers, North American Colonists, and for some military uniforms; consequently, the demand for the dye was high. [S74] The European demand for the dye, however, proved to be unstable, and both creditors and cultivators bore the risk of the market crashes in 1827 and 1847. [S75] The peasant discontent in Bengal eventually led to the *Indigo rebellion* in 1859\u201360 and to the end of indigo production there. [S76] In Bihar, however, indigo production continued well into the 20th century; a centre of indigo production there, Champaran district, became an early testing ground, in 1917, for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's strategy of non-violent resistance against the British Raj."
