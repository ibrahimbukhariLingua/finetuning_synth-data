      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking who founded Keystone Academy and which organization is one of its investors according to the source.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at the passage, [S1] mentions the name of the school. [S2] says it was founded in 2014. [S4] states that Malcolm McKenzie founded Keystone Academy, which opened in 2014. So that's the founder. Then, [S6] and [S7] mention Beijing Meilian Wenhua Investment Co., Ltd. as one of the investors. \n\nSo the answer should be Malcolm McKenzie as the founder and Beijing Meilian Wenhua Investment Co., Ltd. as the investor. The citations would be [S4] for the founder and [S6][S7] for the investor. I need to make sure each part is correctly cited. The user wants the answer in the specified format with each statement and citations. Let me structure that."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the annual tuition fee at Keystone Academy and which organization reported that figure. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions several points. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at the sentences, S8 says: \"The Xinhua News Agency said that Keystone Academy charged more than CN\u00a5200,000 (US$31,008) annually for each student...\" So that seems to answer both parts of the question. The tuition fee is over 200,000 yuan annually, and the organization is Xinhua News Agency.\n\nI should check if there's any other mention of tuition fees. The rest of the sentences talk about the school's accreditation, founding, curriculum, etc., but not the tuition. So S8 is the key sentence here. The citation would be [S8]. \n\nThe user wants the answer in the specified format with <statement> and <cite> tags. So the statement would be about the tuition fee and the Xinhua News Agency. I need to make sure there are no other citations needed. Since only S8 is relevant, the citation is [S8]."
