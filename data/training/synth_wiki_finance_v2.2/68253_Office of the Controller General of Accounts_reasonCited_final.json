      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking two things: the location of the Office of the Controller General of Accounts and the historical changes in its establishment and naming over time.\n\nFirst, I need to find the location. Looking at the supporting context, there's a sentence [S2] that says it's headquartered in Segunbagicha, Dhaka, Bangladesh. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the historical changes. The passage mentions that the office was established in 1985 through an office memo from the Finance Division under the Ministry of Finance [S4]. Before that, it was called the Office of the Accountant General, established in 1947 [S5]. So the name changed from Accountant General to Controller General of Accounts. Also, there's a note about collaborations with another office, but that might not be part of the historical changes in naming. The other sentences mention corruption incidents and monitoring taxes, but those are separate details. \n\nI need to make sure I only include the relevant parts. The answer should state the location and the name changes over time, citing the respective sentences. Let me structure the sentences accordingly."
