[S41] 267). [S42] The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives of the 113th United States Congress on January 15, 2013, and it passed the House on February 13, 2013 by a vote of 422-0. [S43] If enacted, the bill would change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created. [S44] According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants. [S45] H.R. [S46] 267 would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly. [S47] Section 3 of H.R. [S48] 267 amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to increase from 5,000 to 10,000 kilowatts the size of small hydroelectric power projects which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may exempt from its license requirements. [S49] See related energy policy contained in 42 USC Chapter 134 \u2013 Energy Policy. [S50] In October 2018, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) made suggestions in a report that FERC should modernize PURPA for the energy sector.

[S52] One of the original intentions of PURPA was to try to break the U.S.'s dependence on fossil fuels during the 1970s energy crisis. [S53] To accomplish that, PURPA encouraged creation of small power production facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S54] QFs produce power from sources other than fossil fuels, or they make power using a combination of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. [S55] In the NOPR, FERC asserted that today the country has a high supply of \u201crelatively inexpensive\u201d natural gas due to technological advances and the discovery of new gas reserves. [S56] Therefore, FERC wrote, there is no longer the same need now as there was in 1978 to address natural gas shortages. [S57] When PURPA was originally passed in the late 1970s, many utility companies were \u201cvertically integrated\u201d and did not want to buy power from third-party independent generators. [S58] However, today the system and market is much different: the market has open-access transmission and there is a wholesale market that allows utilities to buy power from independent generators at competitive market prices. [S59] Today, most energy production based on renewable resources does not require reliance on PURPA. [S60] In September 2019, during a FERC hearing, its Chairman Neil Chatterjee voiced his support for making changes to PURPA in light of \u201ctremendous technological advances in renewables\u201d since passage of PURPA in 1978. [S61] One idea for updating PURPA is to give more flexibility to individual states to use more competitive prices when setting QF rates.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S62] Investor-owned utility companies, represented by their national association the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), supported FERC\u2019s proposed updates to PURPA. [S63] According to the head of the Edison Electric Institute, PURPA requires utilities to buy energy from QFs at prices that are often higher than market prices, resulting in \u201cbillions of dollars in additional consumer costs\". [S64] EEI also stated it more bluntly: PURPA requires its member utilities to buy power it often doesn\u2019t even need at mandatory above-market prices. [S65] The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the American Public Power Association also supported FERC's proposed changes. [S66] A group of opponents, which included eight attorneys general, the FTC, and electric power supply companies, wrote FERC to express their opposition. [S67] They laid out their concerns that FERC would be overstepping its authority in making these changes, something legal and renewables groups had argued as well.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and other utility groups justified their support for FERC's proposed amendments to PURPA, and how that contrasts with renewable energy advocates' positions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. Let me scan through the passages given. \n\nIn Passage 2, there are several sentences that mention EEI and other utility groups. Specifically, [S62] says that EEI supported FERC's updates. Then [S63] mentions that the head of EEI argued PURPA forces utilities to buy energy from QFs at higher prices, leading to billions in consumer costs. [S64] adds that EEI stated utilities often don't need the power but have to buy it at mandatory above-market prices. Also, [S65] mentions that other groups like the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and American Public Power Association supported the changes. \n\nNow, the contrasting positions of renewable energy advocates. The passage mentions opponents in [S66], which includes eight attorneys general, FTC, and electric power supply companies. They opposed the changes, arguing FERC overstepped its authority ([S67]). The states were concerned the rules might harm renewable deployment ([S68]). So renewable advocates likely opposed the amendments, fearing it would hinder renewable energy growth. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. The EEI's justification is about cost to consumers and unnecessary purchases. The contrast is the opponents' concerns about overstepping and harm to renewables. \n\nCheck if there are other sentences that might be relevant. In Passage 1, there's mention of NARUC's report suggesting FERC exempt some utilities, but that's part of the 2019 NOPR context. However, the question is about EEI and utility groups vs. renewables advocates. So the key citations are in Passage 2: [S62][S63][S64][S65][S66][S67][S68]. \n\nMake sure each statement is correctly cited. For example, the EEI's argument about costs would cite [S63] and [S64]. The support from other groups is [S65]. The opponents are [S66][S67][S68]. \n\nNeed to present this in the required format with <statement> and <cite> tags. Each sentence should be a separate statement with appropriate citations. Also, ensure that the contrast is clear between the utility groups' reasons and the opponents' positions."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act\n\n\n# Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act\n\n\n\nThe **Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act** (**PURPA**, Pub. [S2] L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)\u00a095\u2013617, 92\u00a0Stat. [S3] 3117, enacted November 9, 1978) is a United States Act passed as part of the National Energy Act. [S4] It was meant to promote energy conservation (reduce demand) and promote greater use of domestic energy and renewable energy (increase supply). [S5] The law was created in response to the 1973 energy crisis, and one year in advance of a second energy crisis. [S6] Upon entering the White House, President Jimmy Carter made energy policy a top priority. [S7] The law started the energy industry on the road to restructuring. [S8] ## Law\n\nPURPA was originally passed with the intention of conserving electric energy, increasing efficiency in facilities and resources used by utility companies, making retail rates for electric consumers more fair, speeding up the creation of hydroelectric energy production at small dams, and conserving natural gas. [S9] The main vehicle that the PURPA law used to try and accomplish these goals was by creating a new class of electric generating facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S10] PURPA gave QFs special rate and regulatory treatment. [S11] The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) encouraged:\n\n* creating a market for power from non-utility power producers\n* increased efficiency by making use of cogeneration\n* ending promotional rate structures\n* encouraging the development of hydroelectric power\n* the conservation of electric energy and natural gas\n\n## Non-utility power producers\n\nEnergy companies were classified as natural monopolies, and for this reason, most were established with vertically integrated structures (that is, they undertook all the functions of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to the customer). [S12] Utilities became protected as regulated monopolies because it was thought that a company could produce power more efficiently and economically as one company than as several. [S13] PURPA started the industry on the road to restructuring and is one of the first laws that began the deregulation of energy companies. [S14] The provision which enabled non-utility generators (\"NUGs\") to produce power for use by customers attached to a utility's grid broke the previous monopoly in the generation function. [S15] ## Ending promotional rate structure\n\nUtilities offered customers a \"rate structure\" that decreased the cost per kWh price of electricity with increasing usage, with subsequent increments costing less per unit. [S16] PURPA eliminated promotional rate structures except when they could be justified by the cost structure of utility companies. [S17] ## Cogeneration\n\nOne provision of PURPA is the requirement for increased use of energy cogeneration. [S18] The law forced electric utilities to buy power from other more efficient producers, such as cogeneration plants, if that cost was less than the utility's own \"avoided cost\" rate to the consumer; the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself, or if available, could purchase its demand requirements from another source. [S19] At the time generally, where demand was growing, this \"avoided cost\" was considered to be the construction and fossil fuel costs incurred in the operation of another thermal power plant.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S20] As an effect, the number of cogeneration plants, which produce electric power and steam, increased. [S21] These plants are encouraged by the law, on the basis that they harness thermal energy (in the form of usable steam) that would be otherwise wasted if electricity alone was produced. [S22] PURPA also became the basic legislation that enabled renewable energy providers to gain a toehold in the market, particularly in California, where state authorities were more aggressive in their interpretation of the statute. [S23] The portion of the act dealing with cogeneration and small power production appears in US code in Title 16 \u2013 Conservation, Chapter 12 \u2013 Federal Regulation and Development of Power, Subchapter II \u2013 Regulation of Electric Utility Companies Engaged in Interstate Commerce, Sec 824a-3 \u2013 Cogeneration and Small Power Production. [S24] This led to the establishment of a new class of generating facilities, which would receive special rate and regulatory treatment. [S25] Generating facilities in this group are known as ***qualifying facilities (QFs)***, and fall into two categories: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities. [S26] A *small power production facility* is an electric generation facility that produces 80 MW or less and that uses renewable sources (such as hydro, wind or solar) as its primary energy source. [S27] A *cogeneration facility* is an electric generation facility that creates electricity in a very efficient way, meaning that the facility produces both electricity and \u201canother form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of both forms of energy.\u201d\n\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nPURPA provided favorable terms to companies that produced electricity from renewable (non-fossil-fuel) resources. [S28] California increased wind on the grid from 10 MW in 1981 to 1700 MW in the early 1990s. [S29] ## Implementation\n\nAlthough a Federal law, PURPA's implementation was left to the individual states, because needs varied; a variety of regulatory regimes developed in states where renewable power resources were needed, available for development, or the generated power could be transmitted. [S30] Little was done in many states where such resources were unavailable, where the demand growth was slower or previously accommodated in planning. [S31] ## Legacy\n\nPURPA is becoming less important, as many of the contracts made under it during the 1980s are expiring.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Another reason for PURPA's reduced significance is that electric deregulation and open access to electricity transportation by utilities has created a vast market for the purchase of energy and State regulatory agencies have therefore stopped forcing utilities to give contracts to developers of non-utility power projects. [S32] However, it is still an important piece of legislation promoting renewable energy because it exempts the developers of such projects from numerous State and Federal regulatory regimes. [S33] This free market approach presented investment opportunity and government encouragement for more development of environment-friendly, renewable energy projects and technologies; the law created a market in which non-utility Independent Power Producers developed, and some energy market players failed. [S34] Critics of PURPA cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high. [S35] When oil prices went down, utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts, leading to high power prices. [S36] PURPA was the only existing federal law that requires competition in the utility industry and the only law that encourages renewables, if it is cost competitive with conventional polluting resources, until the 2009 amendments to the Defense Production Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. [S37] ## Amendment proposals and new legislation\n\nIn February 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords from Vermont introduced an amendment to PURPA calling for a Renewable portfolio standard.",

For example, the objectives are mentioned in S4, S5, S8, S9. The QFs and cogeneration provisions are in S10, S11, S18, S19. Also, the effect of cogeneration is in S20, S21. The definition of QFs is in S25, S26, S27, S28. \n\nI should structure the answer into statements, each with their citations.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act\n\n\n# Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act\n\n\n\nThe **Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act** (**PURPA**, Pub. [S2] L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)\u00a095\u2013617, 92\u00a0Stat. [S3] 3117, enacted November 9, 1978) is a United States Act passed as part of the National Energy Act. [S4] It was meant to promote energy conservation (reduce demand) and promote greater use of domestic energy and renewable energy (increase supply). [S5] The law was created in response to the 1973 energy crisis, and one year in advance of a second energy crisis. [S6] Upon entering the White House, President Jimmy Carter made energy policy a top priority. [S7] The law started the energy industry on the road to restructuring. [S8] ## Law\n\nPURPA was originally passed with the intention of conserving electric energy, increasing efficiency in facilities and resources used by utility companies, making retail rates for electric consumers more fair, speeding up the creation of hydroelectric energy production at small dams, and conserving natural gas. [S9] The main vehicle that the PURPA law used to try and accomplish these goals was by creating a new class of electric generating facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S10] PURPA gave QFs special rate and regulatory treatment. [S11] The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) encouraged:\n\n* creating a market for power from non-utility power producers\n* increased efficiency by making use of cogeneration\n* ending promotional rate structures\n* encouraging the development of hydroelectric power\n* the conservation of electric energy and natural gas\n\n## Non-utility power producers\n\nEnergy companies were classified as natural monopolies, and for this reason, most were established with vertically integrated structures (that is, they undertook all the functions of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to the customer). [S12] Utilities became protected as regulated monopolies because it was thought that a company could produce power more efficiently and economically as one company than as several. [S13] PURPA started the industry on the road to restructuring and is one of the first laws that began the deregulation of energy companies. [S14] The provision which enabled non-utility generators (\"NUGs\") to produce power for use by customers attached to a utility's grid broke the previous monopoly in the generation function. [S15] ## Ending promotional rate structure\n\nUtilities offered customers a \"rate structure\" that decreased the cost per kWh price of electricity with increasing usage, with subsequent increments costing less per unit. [S16] PURPA eliminated promotional rate structures except when they could be justified by the cost structure of utility companies. [S17] ## Cogeneration\n\nOne provision of PURPA is the requirement for increased use of energy cogeneration. [S18] The law forced electric utilities to buy power from other more efficient producers, such as cogeneration plants, if that cost was less than the utility's own \"avoided cost\" rate to the consumer; the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself, or if available, could purchase its demand requirements from another source. [S19] At the time generally, where demand was growing, this \"avoided cost\" was considered to be the construction and fossil fuel costs incurred in the operation of another thermal power plant.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S20] As an effect, the number of cogeneration plants, which produce electric power and steam, increased. [S21] These plants are encouraged by the law, on the basis that they harness thermal energy (in the form of usable steam) that would be otherwise wasted if electricity alone was produced. [S22] PURPA also became the basic legislation that enabled renewable energy providers to gain a toehold in the market, particularly in California, where state authorities were more aggressive in their interpretation of the statute. [S23] The portion of the act dealing with cogeneration and small power production appears in US code in Title 16 \u2013 Conservation, Chapter 12 \u2013 Federal Regulation and Development of Power, Subchapter II \u2013 Regulation of Electric Utility Companies Engaged in Interstate Commerce, Sec 824a-3 \u2013 Cogeneration and Small Power Production. [S24] This led to the establishment of a new class of generating facilities, which would receive special rate and regulatory treatment. [S25] Generating facilities in this group are known as ***qualifying facilities (QFs)***, and fall into two categories: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities. [S26] A *small power production facility* is an electric generation facility that produces 80 MW or less and that uses renewable sources (such as hydro, wind or solar) as its primary energy source. [S27] A *cogeneration facility* is an electric generation facility that creates electricity in a very efficient way, meaning that the facility produces both electricity and \u201canother form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of both forms of energy.\u201d\n\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nPURPA provided favorable terms to companies that produced electricity from renewable (non-fossil-fuel) resources. [S28] California increased wind on the grid from 10 MW in 1981 to 1700 MW in the early 1990s. [S29] ## Implementation\n\nAlthough a Federal law, PURPA's implementation was left to the individual states, because needs varied; a variety of regulatory regimes developed in states where renewable power resources were needed, available for development, or the generated power could be transmitted. [S30] Little was done in many states where such resources were unavailable, where the demand growth was slower or previously accommodated in planning. [S31] ## Legacy\n\nPURPA is becoming less important, as many of the contracts made under it during the 1980s are expiring.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Another reason for PURPA's reduced significance is that electric deregulation and open access to electricity transportation by utilities has created a vast market for the purchase of energy and State regulatory agencies have therefore stopped forcing utilities to give contracts to developers of non-utility power projects. [S32] However, it is still an important piece of legislation promoting renewable energy because it exempts the developers of such projects from numerous State and Federal regulatory regimes. [S33] This free market approach presented investment opportunity and government encouragement for more development of environment-friendly, renewable energy projects and technologies; the law created a market in which non-utility Independent Power Producers developed, and some energy market players failed. [S34] Critics of PURPA cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high. [S35] When oil prices went down, utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts, leading to high power prices. [S36] PURPA was the only existing federal law that requires competition in the utility industry and the only law that encourages renewables, if it is cost competitive with conventional polluting resources, until the 2009 amendments to the Defense Production Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. [S37] ## Amendment proposals and new legislation\n\nIn February 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords from Vermont introduced an amendment to PURPA calling for a Renewable portfolio standard.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how PURPA's approach to ending promotional rate structures and its requirements for cogeneration impacted the structure and regulation of the energy industry. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of promotional rate structures. There's a section titled \"Ending promotional rate structure\" with sentences S16 and S17. S16 explains that utilities had rate structures where cost per kWh decreased with usage. S17 says PURPA eliminated these except when justified by cost structure. So, ending promotional rates would make rate structures more cost-based, possibly leading to fairer pricing and affecting how utilities set their rates.\n\nNext, cogeneration. The section on cogeneration (S18-S19) mentions that PURPA required increased use of cogeneration. Utilities had to buy power from more efficient producers like cogeneration plants if it was cheaper than their avoided cost. This would push utilities to integrate more efficient energy production, possibly leading to more cogeneration plants and a shift towards combined heat and power systems. Also, S20-22 talk about the increase in cogeneration plants and their efficiency in using thermal energy.\n\nLooking at the broader impacts, the \"Law\" section (S8) states that PURPA started the energy industry on the road to restructuring. S14 mentions it began deregulation. The \"Non-utility power producers\" section (S15) notes that allowing NUGs broke the monopoly in generation, leading to a more competitive market. This suggests that ending promotional rates and promoting cogeneration contributed to a more competitive and less monopolistic structure.\n\nAdditionally, the creation of QFs (S10, S25-27) introduced new classes of facilities with special treatment, which would have regulatory implications. The shift towards renewable energy and the role of states in implementation (S30) shows that PURPA's requirements led to varied regulatory approaches across states, influencing the overall regulatory landscape.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is tied to the correct citations. For example, the impact on rate structures is from S16 and S17. Cogeneration's impact is from S18, S19, S20, S22. The restructuring and deregulation are mentioned in S8 and S14. The creation of QFs is in S10 and S25-27. Also, the effect on competition and market structure from S15.\n\nI should structure the answer by first addressing the ending of promotional rates, then cogeneration requirements, and then the overall structural and regulatory impacts. Each point needs to be a separate statement with appropriate citations. Make sure not to miss any key points and that each citation is correctly referenced."

[S26] A *small power production facility* is an electric generation facility that produces 80 MW or less and that uses renewable sources (such as hydro, wind or solar) as its primary energy source. [S27] A *cogeneration facility* is an electric generation facility that creates electricity in a very efficient way, meaning that the facility produces both electricity and \u201canother form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of both forms of energy.\u201d\n\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nPURPA provided favorable terms to companies that produced electricity from renewable (non-fossil-fuel) resources. [S28] California increased wind on the grid from 10 MW in 1981 to 1700 MW in the early 1990s. [S29] ## Implementation\n\nAlthough a Federal law, PURPA's implementation was left to the individual states, because needs varied; a variety of regulatory regimes developed in states where renewable power resources were needed, available for development, or the generated power could be transmitted. [S30] Little was done in many states where such resources were unavailable, where the demand growth was slower or previously accommodated in planning. [S31] ## Legacy\n\nPURPA is becoming less important, as many of the contracts made under it during the 1980s are expiring.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Another reason for PURPA's reduced significance is that electric deregulation and open access to electricity transportation by utilities has created a vast market for the purchase of energy and State regulatory agencies have therefore stopped forcing utilities to give contracts to developers of non-utility power projects. [S32] However, it is still an important piece of legislation promoting renewable energy because it exempts the developers of such projects from numerous State and Federal regulatory regimes. [S33] This free market approach presented investment opportunity and government encouragement for more development of environment-friendly, renewable energy projects and technologies; the law created a market in which non-utility Independent Power Producers developed, and some energy market players failed. [S34] Critics of PURPA cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high. [S35] When oil prices went down, utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts, leading to high power prices. [S36] PURPA was the only existing federal law that requires competition in the utility industry and the only law that encourages renewables, if it is cost competitive with conventional polluting resources, until the 2009 amendments to the Defense Production Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. [S37] ## Amendment proposals and new legislation\n\nIn February 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords from Vermont introduced an amendment to PURPA calling for a Renewable portfolio standard."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of state-level implementation in PURPA's effectiveness and how this varied across regions. I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of state-level implementation. In Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Implementation\" with sentence S30. It says that although PURPA was a federal law, implementation was left to the states because needs varied. This led to different regulatory regimes in states where renewable resources were needed, available, or could be transmitted. Then S31 mentions that little was done in states where resources were unavailable, demand growth was slower, or previously accommodated. \n\nSo, the role of state-level implementation was crucial because the law's effectiveness depended on how states handled it. The variation across regions is highlighted by the fact that some states (like California) were more aggressive, while others didn't act much if resources weren't available or demand wasn't growing. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The key points are in S30 and S31. The answer should state that state-level implementation allowed for varied approaches based on regional needs, leading to differences in effectiveness. California's example is mentioned in S22, but the main variation is covered in S30 and S31. \n\nI should structure the answer with two statements: one explaining the role of state implementation and another about the regional variation, each citing the relevant sentences."

[S2] L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)\u00a095\u2013617, 92\u00a0Stat. [S3] 3117, enacted November 9, 1978) is a United States Act passed as part of the National Energy Act. [S4] It was meant to promote energy conservation (reduce demand) and promote greater use of domestic energy and renewable energy (increase supply). [S5] The law was created in response to the 1973 energy crisis, and one year in advance of a second energy crisis. [S6] Upon entering the White House, President Jimmy Carter made energy policy a top priority. [S7] The law started the energy industry on the road to restructuring. [S8] ## Law\n\nPURPA was originally passed with the intention of conserving electric energy, increasing efficiency in facilities and resources used by utility companies, making retail rates for electric consumers more fair, speeding up the creation of hydroelectric energy production at small dams, and conserving natural gas. [S9] The main vehicle that the PURPA law used to try and accomplish these goals was by creating a new class of electric generating facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S10] PURPA gave QFs special rate and regulatory treatment. [S11] The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) encouraged:\n\n* creating a market for power from non-utility power producers\n* increased efficiency by making use of cogeneration\n* ending promotional rate structures\n* encouraging the development of hydroelectric power\n* the conservation of electric energy and natural gas\n\n## Non-utility power producers\n\nEnergy companies were classified as natural monopolies, and for this reason, most were established with vertically integrated structures (that is, they undertook all the functions of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to the customer). [S12] Utilities became protected as regulated monopolies because it was thought that a company could produce power more efficiently and economically as one company than as several. [S13] PURPA started the industry on the road to restructuring and is one of the first laws that began the deregulation of energy companies. [S14] The provision which enabled non-utility generators (\"NUGs\") to produce power for use by customers attached to a utility's grid broke the previous monopoly in the generation function. [S15] ## Ending promotional rate structure\n\nUtilities offered customers a \"rate structure\" that decreased the cost per kWh price of electricity with increasing usage, with subsequent increments costing less per unit. [S16] PURPA eliminated promotional rate structures except when they could be justified by the cost structure of utility companies. [S17] ## Cogeneration\n\nOne provision of PURPA is the requirement for increased use of energy cogeneration. [S18] The law forced electric utilities to buy power from other more efficient producers, such as cogeneration plants, if that cost was less than the utility's own \"avoided cost\" rate to the consumer; the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself, or if available, could purchase its demand requirements from another source. [S19] At the time generally, where demand was growing, this \"avoided cost\" was considered to be the construction and fossil fuel costs incurred in the operation of another thermal power plant.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S20] As an effect, the number of cogeneration plants, which produce electric power and steam, increased. [S21] These plants are encouraged by the law, on the basis that they harness thermal energy (in the form of usable steam) that would be otherwise wasted if electricity alone was produced. [S22] PURPA also became the basic legislation that enabled renewable energy providers to gain a toehold in the market, particularly in California, where state authorities were more aggressive in their interpretation of the statute. [S23] The portion of the act dealing with cogeneration and small power production appears in US code in Title 16 \u2013 Conservation, Chapter 12 \u2013 Federal Regulation and Development of Power, Subchapter II \u2013 Regulation of Electric Utility Companies Engaged in Interstate Commerce, Sec 824a-3 \u2013 Cogeneration and Small Power Production. [S24] This led to the establishment of a new class of generating facilities, which would receive special rate and regulatory treatment. [S25] Generating facilities in this group are known as ***qualifying facilities (QFs)***, and fall into two categories: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key criticisms of PURPA and how its cost-based contracts contributed to those challenges. I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of criticisms. In Passage 2, there's a sentence that says, \"Critics of PURPA cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high.\" That's a direct criticism. Then it mentions, \"When oil prices went down, utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts, leading to high power prices.\" So the cost-based contracts led to high prices when energy prices dropped. \n\nAnother part in Passage 1 talks about the \"avoided cost\" rate, which is the cost the utility would incur if they generated the power themselves. If the contract rates were higher than the avoided cost, utilities might have to pay more. But the passage also says that PURPA required utilities to buy power from more efficient producers if it was cheaper than their avoided cost. However, the criticism here is about the contracts being fixed when energy prices fell, causing issues.\n\nLooking at the citations, the sentences about critics are in [S35] and [S36]. The part about cost-based contracts is in [S19], which explains the avoided cost mechanism. But the specific criticism about the contracts leading to high prices when oil prices dropped is in [S35] and [S36]. \n\nSo the key criticisms are the multi-year contracts signed during high energy prices, leading to high power prices when oil prices dropped. The cost-based contracts (avoided cost) contributed because utilities had to stick to those rates even when market prices fell. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. The first statement about the criticism would cite [S35] and [S36]. The second part about cost-based contracts would cite [S19] and maybe [S35] again. Wait, [S19] explains the avoided cost, which is part of the cost-based contracts. So the contribution of the provisions is explained in [S19], and the criticism is in [S35] and [S36]. \n\nSo the answer should have two statements: one stating the criticisms with citations [S35][S36], and another explaining how the cost-based contracts (avoided cost) contributed, citing [S19]. But the user's question asks how the provisions on cost-based contracts contributed to the challenges. So the second part needs to link the cost-based contracts to the problem. The passage says that the avoided cost was the cost of building another thermal plant, but when oil prices dropped, the contracts were still in place. So the cost-based contracts (fixed rates) led to high prices when market prices fell. \n\nTherefore, the answer should have two statements: one with the criticisms and another explaining the contribution of the cost-based contracts. The citations would be [S35][S36] for the criticisms and [S19] for the cost-based part. Also, maybe [S35] mentions the contracts, so maybe [S35][S19] for the second statement. Let me check the exact sentences again.\n\nSentence [S19]: \"The law forced electric utilities to buy power from other more efficient producers, such as cogeneration plants, if that cost was less than the utility's own 'avoided cost' rate to the consumer; the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself, or if available, could purchase its demand requirements from another source.\"\n\nSo the cost-based contracts are based on avoided cost. The criticism is that when energy prices dropped, utilities had to honor the rates from those contracts. So the provision on cost-based contracts (avoided cost) led to utilities being stuck with higher rates when market prices fell. Therefore, the statement about the contribution would cite [S19] and [S35][S36]. But the user wants each sentence to have its own citations. So the first sentence about the criticisms would be [S35][S36], and the second sentence explaining the cost-based contracts' role would cite [S19]. \n\nI think that's it. Need to make sure each statement is properly cited."

[S40] in the US Senate that would amend PURPA to require FERC to develop standards for interconnection of distributed generation facilities, and that would require \"electric utilities\" meeting the PURPA size requirement (retail sales of more than 500 million kw hrs) to implement those standards.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nOne proposed law that would amend PURPA is the Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013 (H.R. [S41] 267). [S42] The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives of the 113th United States Congress on January 15, 2013, and it passed the House on February 13, 2013 by a vote of 422-0. [S43] If enacted, the bill would change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created. [S44] According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants. [S45] H.R. [S46] 267 would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly. [S47] Section 3 of H.R. [S48] 267 amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to increase from 5,000 to 10,000 kilowatts the size of small hydroelectric power projects which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may exempt from its license requirements. [S49] See related energy policy contained in 42 USC Chapter 134 \u2013 Energy Policy. [S50] In October 2018, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) made suggestions in a report that FERC should modernize PURPA for the energy sector. [S51] NARUC's paper \"proposes that FERC exempt from PURPA\u2019s mandatory purchase obligation those utilities which are subject to state competitive solicitation requirements and other best practices that ensure all technologies access to the market.\"\n\n\n### 2019 FERC notice of proposed rulemaking\n\nIn September 2019, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced its intention to update certain provisions of the PURPA law, in a process known as a \u201cnotice of proposed rulemaking\u201d (NOPR). [S52] One of the original intentions of PURPA was to try to break the U.S.'s dependence on fossil fuels during the 1970s energy crisis. [S53] To accomplish that, PURPA encouraged creation of small power production facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S54] QFs produce power from sources other than fossil fuels, or they make power using a combination of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. [S55] In the NOPR, FERC asserted that today the country has a high supply of \u201crelatively inexpensive\u201d natural gas due to technological advances and the discovery of new gas reserves. [S56] Therefore, FERC wrote, there is no longer the same need now as there was in 1978 to address natural gas shortages. [S57] When PURPA was originally passed in the late 1970s, many utility companies were \u201cvertically integrated\u201d and did not want to buy power from third-party independent generators. [S58] However, today the system and market is much different: the market has open-access transmission and there is a wholesale market that allows utilities to buy power from independent generators at competitive market prices. [S59] Today, most energy production based on renewable resources does not require reliance on PURPA. [S60] In September 2019, during a FERC hearing, its Chairman Neil Chatterjee voiced his support for making changes to PURPA in light of \u201ctremendous technological advances in renewables\u201d since passage of PURPA in 1978. [S61] One idea for updating PURPA is to give more flexibility to individual states to use more competitive prices when setting QF rates.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S62] Investor-owned utility companies, represented by their national association the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), supported FERC\u2019s proposed updates to PURPA. [S63] According to the head of the Edison Electric Institute, PURPA requires utilities to buy energy from QFs at prices that are often higher than market prices, resulting in \u201cbillions of dollars in additional consumer costs\". [S64] EEI also stated it more bluntly: PURPA requires its member utilities to buy power it often doesn\u2019t even need at mandatory above-market prices. [S65] The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the American Public Power Association also supported FERC's proposed changes. [S66] A group of opponents, which included eight attorneys general, the FTC, and electric power supply companies, wrote FERC to express their opposition. [S67] They laid out their concerns that FERC would be overstepping its authority in making these changes, something legal and renewables groups had argued as well. [S68] The states also raised concerns that the rules could harm renewables deployment in their states and others according to the electric industry news site UTILITY DIVE.",

[S41] 267). [S42] The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives of the 113th United States Congress on January 15, 2013, and it passed the House on February 13, 2013 by a vote of 422-0. [S43] If enacted, the bill would change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier for smaller hydropower stations to be created.

[S46] 267 would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly. [S47] Section 3 of H.R. [S48] 267 amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to increase from 5,000 to 10,000 kilowatts the size of small hydroelectric power projects which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may exempt from its license requirements.

[S52] One of the original intentions of PURPA was to try to break the U.S.'s dependence on fossil fuels during the 1970s energy crisis. [S53] To accomplish that, PURPA encouraged creation of small power production facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S54] QFs produce power from sources other than fossil fuels, or they make power using a combination of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. [S55] In the NOPR, FERC asserted that today the country has a high supply of \u201crelatively inexpensive\u201d natural gas due to technological advances and the discovery of new gas reserves. [S56] Therefore, FERC wrote, there is no longer the same need now as there was in 1978 to address natural gas shortages. [S57] When PURPA was originally passed in the late 1970s, many utility companies were \u201cvertically integrated\u201d and did not want to buy power from third-party independent generators. [S58] However, today the system and market is much different: the market has open-access transmission and there is a wholesale market that allows utilities to buy power from independent generators at competitive market prices. [S59] Today, most energy production based on renewable resources does not require reliance on PURPA. [S60] In September 2019, during a FERC hearing, its Chairman Neil Chatterjee voiced his support for making changes to PURPA in light of \u201ctremendous technological advances in renewables\u201d since passage of PURPA in 1978. [S61] One idea for updating PURPA is to give more flexibility to individual states to use more competitive prices when setting QF rates.",
        "[S62] Investor-owned utility companies, represented by their national association the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), supported FERC\u2019s proposed updates to PURPA. [S63] According to the head of the Edison Electric Institute, PURPA requires utilities to buy energy from QFs at prices that are often higher than market prices, resulting in \u201cbillions of dollars in additional consumer costs\". [S64] EEI also stated it more bluntly: PURPA requires its member utilities to buy power it often doesn\u2019t even need at mandatory above-market prices. [S65] The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the American Public Power Association also supported FERC's proposed changes. [S66] A group of opponents, which included eight attorneys general, the FTC, and electric power supply companies, wrote FERC to express their opposition. [S67] They laid out their concerns that FERC would be overstepping its authority in making these changes, something legal and renewables groups had argued as well.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how FERC's 2019 NOPR addressed the original intent of PURPA and what factors influenced their decision to propose changes.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that PURPA's original intent was to reduce dependence on fossil fuels during the 1970s energy crisis by encouraging small power production facilities. The 2019 NOPR by FERC noted that today's energy landscape is different. They mentioned that natural gas is more abundant and cheaper now, so the original need to address gas shortages isn't there anymore. Also, the market has evolved with open-access transmission and competitive wholesale markets, making PURPA's requirements less necessary.\n\nFactors influencing the decision include technological advances in renewables, the current abundance of natural gas, and the changed market structure. Additionally, utility companies like EEI supported the changes, arguing that PURPA's mandatory purchase prices are costly and unnecessary now. Opponents, however, were concerned about overstepping authority and potential harm to renewables.\n\nI need to structure the answer with citations. The original intent is covered in S53-S55. The factors like natural gas availability and market changes are in S56-S59. The influence of utility companies is in S62-S65. The opponents' concerns are in S67-S68. Also, the NARUC report in S51 might be relevant for modernizing PURPA.\n\nWait, the question is about how the NOPR addressed the original intent. The NOPR's reasoning was that the original intent (reducing fossil fuel dependence) is less urgent now due to current energy sources and market conditions. So the answer should connect the NOPR's reasoning to the original intent and the factors like natural gas, market changes, and utility pressures.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with correct citations. Let me check each part again to ensure accuracy."

    "[S1] Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act\n\n\n# Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act\n\n\n\nThe **Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act** (**PURPA**, Pub. [S2] L.Tooltip Public Law (United States)\u00a095\u2013617, 92\u00a0Stat. [S3] 3117, enacted November 9, 1978) is a United States Act passed as part of the National Energy Act. [S4] It was meant to promote energy conservation (reduce demand) and promote greater use of domestic energy and renewable energy (increase supply). [S5] The law was created in response to the 1973 energy crisis, and one year in advance of a second energy crisis. [S6] Upon entering the White House, President Jimmy Carter made energy policy a top priority. [S7] The law started the energy industry on the road to restructuring. [S8] ## Law\n\nPURPA was originally passed with the intention of conserving electric energy, increasing efficiency in facilities and resources used by utility companies, making retail rates for electric consumers more fair, speeding up the creation of hydroelectric energy production at small dams, and conserving natural gas. [S9] The main vehicle that the PURPA law used to try and accomplish these goals was by creating a new class of electric generating facilities called \u201cqualifying facilities\u201d (QFs). [S10] PURPA gave QFs special rate and regulatory treatment. [S11] The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) encouraged:\n\n* creating a market for power from non-utility power producers\n* increased efficiency by making use of cogeneration\n* ending promotional rate structures\n* encouraging the development of hydroelectric power\n* the conservation of electric energy and natural gas\n\n## Non-utility power producers\n\nEnergy companies were classified as natural monopolies, and for this reason, most were established with vertically integrated structures (that is, they undertook all the functions of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to the customer). [S12] Utilities became protected as regulated monopolies because it was thought that a company could produce power more efficiently and economically as one company than as several. [S13] PURPA started the industry on the road to restructuring and is one of the first laws that began the deregulation of energy companies. [S14] The provision which enabled non-utility generators (\"NUGs\") to produce power for use by customers attached to a utility's grid broke the previous monopoly in the generation function. [S15] ## Ending promotional rate structure\n\nUtilities offered customers a \"rate structure\" that decreased the cost per kWh price of electricity with increasing usage, with subsequent increments costing less per unit. [S16] PURPA eliminated promotional rate structures except when they could be justified by the cost structure of utility companies. [S17] ## Cogeneration\n\nOne provision of PURPA is the requirement for increased use of energy cogeneration. [S18] The law forced electric utilities to buy power from other more efficient producers, such as cogeneration plants, if that cost was less than the utility's own \"avoided cost\" rate to the consumer; the avoided cost rate was the additional costs that the electric utility would incur if it generated the required power itself, or if available, could purchase its demand requirements from another source. [S19] At the time generally, where demand was growing, this \"avoided cost\" was considered to be the construction and fossil fuel costs incurred in the operation of another thermal power plant.",
    "[S20] As an effect, the number of cogeneration plants, which produce electric power and steam, increased. [S21] These plants are encouraged by the law, on the basis that they harness thermal energy (in the form of usable steam) that would be otherwise wasted if electricity alone was produced. [S22] PURPA also became the basic legislation that enabled renewable energy providers to gain a toehold in the market, particularly in California, where state authorities were more aggressive in their interpretation of the statute. [S23] The portion of the act dealing with cogeneration and small power production appears in US code in Title 16 \u2013 Conservation, Chapter 12 \u2013 Federal Regulation and Development of Power, Subchapter II \u2013 Regulation of Electric Utility Companies Engaged in Interstate Commerce, Sec 824a-3 \u2013 Cogeneration and Small Power Production. [S24] This led to the establishment of a new class of generating facilities, which would receive special rate and regulatory treatment. [S25] Generating facilities in this group are known as ***qualifying facilities (QFs)***, and fall into two categories: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities. [S26] A *small power production facility* is an electric generation facility that produces 80 MW or less and that uses renewable sources (such as hydro, wind or solar) as its primary energy source. [S27] A *cogeneration facility* is an electric generation facility that creates electricity in a very efficient way, meaning that the facility produces both electricity and \u201canother form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of both forms of energy.\u201d\n\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nPURPA provided favorable terms to companies that produced electricity from renewable (non-fossil-fuel) resources. [S28] California increased wind on the grid from 10 MW in 1981 to 1700 MW in the early 1990s. [S29] ## Implementation\n\nAlthough a Federal law, PURPA's implementation was left to the individual states, because needs varied; a variety of regulatory regimes developed in states where renewable power resources were needed, available for development, or the generated power could be transmitted. [S30] Little was done in many states where such resources were unavailable, where the demand growth was slower or previously accommodated in planning. [S31] ## Legacy\n\nPURPA is becoming less important, as many of the contracts made under it during the 1980s are expiring.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Another reason for PURPA's reduced significance is that electric deregulation and open access to electricity transportation by utilities has created a vast market for the purchase of energy and State regulatory agencies have therefore stopped forcing utilities to give contracts to developers of non-utility power projects. [S32] However, it is still an important piece of legislation promoting renewable energy because it exempts the developers of such projects from numerous State and Federal regulatory regimes. [S33] This free market approach presented investment opportunity and government encouragement for more development of environment-friendly, renewable energy projects and technologies; the law created a market in which non-utility Independent Power Producers developed, and some energy market players failed. [S34] Critics of PURPA cited that power producers signed multi-year cost of electricity contracts at a time when energy prices were high. [S35] When oil prices went down, utilities had to honor the rates of those contracts, leading to high power prices. [S36] PURPA was the only existing federal law that requires competition in the utility industry and the only law that encourages renewables, if it is cost competitive with conventional polluting resources, until the 2009 amendments to the Defense Production Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. [S37] ## Amendment proposals and new legislation\n\nIn February 2005, Senator Jim Jeffords from Vermont introduced an amendment to PURPA calling for a Renewable portfolio standard.",
    "[S38] PURPA was amended in 2005 by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in sections 1251 through 1254. [S39] There is pending legislation\u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f?
