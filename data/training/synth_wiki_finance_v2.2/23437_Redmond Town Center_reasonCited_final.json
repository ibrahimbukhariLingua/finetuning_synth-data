      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Redmond Town Center\n\n\n# Redmond Town Center\n\n\n\n**Redmond Town Center** is a mixed-use development and shopping center located in downtown Redmond, Washington. [S2] Owned and managed by Fairbourne Properties, Redmond Town Center has more than 110 shops, restaurants, lodging, and entertainment venues in an outdoor environment. [S3] It opened in 1997 on the site of a defunct municipal golf course along the north side of State Route 520. [S4] DRA Advisors and JSH acquired the retail component of the Redmond Town Center in 2013, shortly after Shorenstein Properties bought the office portion, which is occupied by Microsoft and AT&T. [S5] In late 2019, the retail portion was sold to Fairbourne Properties. [S6] ## History\n\nThe site was formerly Redmond Golf Links, an 18 hole golf course that opened in 1932. [S7] In 1978, Winmar, a real estate company owned by Safeco Insurance., eventually closed the 120-acre property and planned to develop the site into a mixed-use shopping mall. [S8] The project, named Maingate, was planned to include 1,350,000 square feet (125,000 m\u00b2 ) of retail space, along with office spaces, 160 residential units, and 25-30 acres of open space. [S9] This project was controversial, with some Redmond residents and city council candidates expressing concern about the proposed mall's impacts on the walkable nature of the city. [S10] In 1988, the city conditionally approved the project. [S11] Four department stores\u2014Mervyn's, Frederick & Nelson, The Bon March\u00e9, and JCPenney\u2014were signed to be major tenants of Maingate and planning continued for the project, with a construction date announced. [S12] By 1992, Frederick & Nelson went out of business due to bankruptcy and the owner of Bon March\u00e9, Federated Department Stores, briefly went bankrupt. [S13] These two events made the project go on a downward spiral that led to the demise of the project. [S14] However, also in 1992, the City of Redmond accepted another project on the same site by the same developer, Winmar. [S15] Redmond Town Center, which would've included a mixed-use town center that was similar to Maingate, but it was an outdoor center and it only had one department store. [S16] It included a decreased retail space, a walkable town center, hotels, and offices, and residential spaces This project was received more positively by residents and the City Council. [S17] Groundbreaking for the development in 1995, with historical buildings being kept intact while everything else in the site was demolished. [S18] Redmond Town Center eventually opened. [S19] The complex had two floors on the retail section, both directing to stores and dining. [S20] The development included 674,287 square feet (65,000 m\u00b2 ) of retail space, numerous office buildings, two hotels being owned by Marriott, Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Residence Inn by Marriott, and The Bon March\u00e9, Zany Brainy, REI, Larry's Market, Borders, Todai, and Cineplex Odeon as major anchors. [S21] Office spaces were leased by Microsoft, AT&T Wireless Services, and other tenants. [S22] The development was built in stages, with the town center, offices, and hotels being built before the Bon March\u00e9, as construction was officially finished by 2003. [S23] There were three strip malls connected to the development, Creekside Crossing along Redmond Way, a different center featuring Larry's, Cost Plus World Market, and Big 5 Sporting Goods, and a center including Zany Brainy, Bed Bath & Beyond, and other retail tenants. [S24] After three year of opening, Zany Brainy shuttered from bankruptcy and FAO Schwarz dissolving the company in December 2003. [S25] Months after closing, Petco announced that they were moving into the former space in 2004 from Bear Creek Village, a shopping center nearby, to Redmond Town Center. [S26] It later opened in 2004 in its new space.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S52] The majority of the office space at Redmond Town Center comprises six buildings of three to five stories.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the timeline and major milestones of Redmond Town Center's construction and development. The user wants to know the timeline and the key events.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me parse through each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the opening of the Redmond Town Center. Sentence [S3] says it opened in 1997 on a former golf course. Then, looking at the history section. There's mention of the Maingate project in the 1970s and 1980s. The original plan was for a mall, but it faced issues. The project was conditionally approved in 1988 [S10], but then things fell apart. Frederick & Nelson and Bon March\u00e9 had issues, leading to the project's demise [S13]. However, in 1992, the city accepted a new project by Winmar, which became Redmond Town Center [S14]. Groundbreaking was in 1995 [S17], and it opened in 1997 [S3]. \n\nThen there's the development phases. The construction was in stages, with the town center, offices, and hotels built before the Bon March\u00e9, finishing by 2003 [S22]. There were three strip malls added later. Also, Zany Brainy closed in 2003, and Petco moved in in 2004 [S25-S26]. \n\nOther milestones include the retail portion being sold to Fairbourne in 2019 [S5], and the acquisition of the retail component by DRA and JSH in 2013 [S4]. The office portion was bought by Shorenstein in 2013, occupied by Microsoft and AT&T [S4]. \n\nLooking at the later part, Amazon's new office opening in 2021 [S54]. Also, the office buildings are mentioned, with AT&T and Microsoft occupying them [S53]. \n\nI need to structure the timeline chronologically. Start with the original golf course, then the Maingate project attempts, the shift to Redmond Town Center, groundbreaking in 1995, opening in 1997, construction phases until 2003, then the strip malls, closures and new tenants, the 2013 acquisitions, 2019 sale, and the Amazon office in 2021. \n\nCheck each event's citation. For example, the 1997 opening [S3], 1995 groundbreaking [S17], 1992 new project [S14], 1988 approval [S10], 1978 planning [S7], 1932 golf course [S6]. Also, the office buildings' details [S52-S54], but maybe that's more about current setup than construction timeline. \n\nWait, the question is about construction and development phases. So focus on when each phase happened. The initial development phases: 1995 groundbreaking, 1997 opening. Then the completion of construction by 2003 [S22]. The strip malls connected later. Then the retail sale in 2019, and Amazon's office in 2021. \n\nAlso, the original plan for Maingate in the 70s, but that didn't happen. The shift to the new project in 1992. So the major milestones would include the 1992 decision, 1995 groundbreaking, 1997 opening, 2003 completion, 2013 acquisitions, 2019 sale, and 2021 Amazon office. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with proper citations. For example, the opening in 1997 [S3], the 1995 groundbreaking [S17], the 1992 project [S14], the 1988 approval [S10], the 1978 planning [S7], and so on. Also, the construction phases until 2003 [S22], the strip malls, and the later events. \n\nI should structure each milestone as a separate statement with the relevant citations. Need to check each sentence in the passage to ensure all key points are covered without missing any major milestones."

[S26] It later opened in 2004 in its new space.",
    "[S27] In 2005, as The Bon March\u00e9 was acquired by Macy's, the tenant was converted into Macy's. [S28] In 2008, Larry's Market shuttered as Haggen's bought the tenant, and briefly converted it into a Top Food & Drug in 2008 that closed in 2010. [S29] In 2013, the tenant was converted into a 24 Hour Fitness. [S30] In 2011, as a result of the company going bankrupt, Borders closed all their locations, including the Redmond location. [S31] It was left vacant until 2016, when it was divided into multiple tenants, with one being a Ducati dealership independently owned, a T-Mobile store opening, and an office building on the second floor location.\u1d47\u1d49\u1d57\u1d57\u1d49\u02b3\u02e2\u1d52\u1d58\u02b3\u1d9c\u1d49\u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nDuring 2010, Todai, a Japanese buffet, closed down due to unknown reason. [S32] In August 2011, Haiku, another Japanese buffet. [S33] opened up on its former space. [S34] In 2015, Claim Jumpers, a restaurant that sat outside of Redmond Town Center since it first opened, shuttered. [S35] Plans for a hotel that would be 160 room hotel and 7 stories high were made with Lodgeworks, the owner of Archer Hotels. [S36] Construction started in 2016, and In 2019, the hotel opened on top of the former Claim Jumpers restaurant. [S37] In 2016, REI moved its store from Redmond Town Center to Bellevue, selling its building it was occupied in. [S38] In 2018, it was converted into Restoration Hardware before closing a few months later. [S39] In 2018, Macy's announced that it would be closing around 100 locations, including the one in Redmond Town Center. [S40] In 2019, the store was shuttered. [S41] In 2020, Amazon released plans of converting the former Macy's building into an Amazon office, while a few months later, the former REI was planned to be converted into a Volkswagen automotive cloud office. [S42] As both offices opened in 2021, in 2022, the City of Redmond and Fairbourne Properties released plans of redeveloping the town center by building more mixed-use buildings over current parking lots. [S43] These buildings would include adapting more retail, residential units, and offices into the site. [S44] They plan to turn Redmond Town Center into a walkable urban center. [S45] The town center wasn't affected as much as nearby shopping centers at the time during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but during the pandemic, as part of the 200 other stores, Bed Bath & Beyond closed its doors and Haiku, in turn, shuttered in September of that year. [S46] However, during 2022, numerous tenants would sign with the town center, including H Mart, an Asian Supermarket, that would replace the former Bed Bath & Beyond, and a handful of restaurant spaces. [S47] In 2023, nearby tenant HobbyTown, whose building is about to be demolished due to a redevelopment on their former space and the Downtown Redmond Light Rail under construction near its current building, announced plans to move into the former American Eagle Outfitters space in a unknown date . [S48] In the same year, Daiso, a variety store, announced an opening in the former Victoria's Secret and Pink space in February of that year. [S49] Tous les Jours, a South Korean bakery, would also open their new location in the aforementioned H Mart building. [S50] Local restaurant and entertainment chain, Flatstick Pub, opened in February of the same year.
