      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the 2000 distribution center closure in Homerville, Georgia, and how it related to Dollar General's operational and financial developments at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find any mentions of the Homerville closure. Scanning through the sections, I see in the \"1968\u20132002\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia, was closed in April 2000 and operations were moved to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.\" That's sentence [S33]. \n\nNow, the question is about the significance of this closure. The passage doesn't explicitly state the reasons for the closure, but it does mention that the closure happened around the same time as other developments. For example, in the same section, it notes that in 2000, Dollar General opened a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, and by the end of 2000, sales exceeded $4 billion. These points are in [S30] and [S31]. \n\nSo, the closure of the Homerville center might be part of operational restructuring. Moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida, could indicate efforts to optimize logistics or reduce costs. The timing coincides with the new headquarters and increased sales, suggesting that the closure was part of broader strategic moves to improve efficiency, which contributed to financial growth. However, the passage doesn't explicitly link the closure to these financial developments, so I have to infer based on the timeline and the fact that such moves are common in corporate strategies to enhance efficiency.\n\nThe user also asked how this related to operational and financial developments. The operational aspect would be the relocation of the distribution center, which is a common practice to streamline operations. Financially, the closure might have been part of cost-saving measures, allowing the company to allocate resources elsewhere, which could have contributed to the $4 billion in sales by the end of 2000. However, since the passage doesn't explicitly state these connections, I need to be careful not to assume beyond what's written. The citations would be [S33] for the closure itself, and [S30] and [S31] for the context of the new headquarters and sales figures."

The user is asking how the source contextualizes Dollar General's profitability and the criticisms of its business practices, and what specific financial milestone is highlighted.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. Let me scan the sentences again. \n\nStarting with the profitability: Sentence S7 mentions that Dollar General has become one of the most profitable stores in rural US with $27 billion revenue in 2019. That's a key point. Then, the criticisms are in S8, which talks about creating food deserts, stifling local businesses, and offering fewer, lower-paying jobs. \n\nThe question also asks for a specific financial milestone related to these critiques. The $27 billion revenue in 2019 seems to be the milestone. But I need to check if there's another one. Looking through the rest, S6 mentions reaching #112 on Fortune 500 in 2020, but that's more about ranking than a financial milestone. S25 talks about sales over $40 million in 1968, but that's earlier. The main financial milestone tied to the criticisms would be the $27B in 2019. \n\nSo the answer should connect the profitability (S7) with the criticisms (S8), and the financial milestone is S7. Need to make sure the citations are correctly placed. Each statement should have its own citations. So the first part about profitability and the milestone is S7, and the criticisms are S8. The financial milestone is part of S7. \n\nI need to structure the answer with two statements: one stating the profitability and the milestone, citing S7, and another stating the criticisms, citing S8. Wait, but the question asks how the source contextualizes both profitability and criticisms, and the financial milestone. So maybe combine them into one statement? But according to the response format, each sentence is a separate statement. \n\nSo maybe: \n\nFirst statement: Dollar General's profitability is highlighted with $27B revenue in 2019 (S7). \n\nSecond statement: Criticisms include creating food deserts, etc. (S8). \n\nBut the question is how the source contextualizes both. So perhaps the answer is two statements, each with their own citations. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer would have two statements, each with their respective citations. The financial milestone is in S7, which also mentions profitability. The criticisms are in S8. \n\nI think that's it. Let me check again. The user wants the specific financial milestone related to the critiques. The milestone is the $27B revenue, which is in S7. The criticisms are in S8. So the answer should link those two sentences."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the financial commitments of the Dollar General Literacy Foundation and how they reflect its long-term community impact. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the Dollar General Literacy Foundation in several places. Let me scan through the text again.\n\nStarting with the section on the Dollar General Literacy Foundation: it says that since 1993, Dollar General has provided funding through this subsidiary for literacy and education programs. The key points here are the $182 million in grants awarded, helping over 11 million individuals. Then there's the 2020 award of $8.6 million to 970 organizations, which was the largest one-day grant. Also, in April 2022, there's a mention of a $9.2 million commitment, with $8.2 million for family literacy programs and $1 million for DonorsChoose.\n\nSo the financial commitments include the $182 million total, the $8.6 million in 2020, and the $9.2 million in 2022. The question also asks how these reflect long-term community impact. The numbers show consistent funding over years, with specific examples of large grants. The impact is measured in the number of people helped, like 11 million individuals, which indicates a significant and sustained effort.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. The $182 million is cited as [S127], the 2020 $8.6 million as [S128], and the 2022 $9.2 million as [S130]. The mention of the 25th anniversary in 2018 [S129] might also be relevant to show longevity. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer in the specified format with each sentence in <statement> tags and citations. So I need to structure the answer with each fact as a separate statement, each with their citations. Also, check if all the numbers are correctly attributed. \n\nI should also ensure that the answer connects the financial commitments to the community impact. For example, the $182 million leading to 11 million people helped, and the ongoing grants showing continued commitment. The 2022 commitment of $9.2 million shows recent efforts, indicating long-term dedication.\n\nI need to avoid any markdown and just use the <statement> and <cite> tags. Let me piece this together step by step."

      "answer": "<statement>In 2024, Dollar General shut down self-checkout systems in more than half of its U.S. stores due to losses from theft, as noted in the passage. This decision reflects a shift toward mitigating operational risks and improving profitability. <cite>[S119]</cite></statement> <statement>This operational change aligns with Dollar General\u2019s broader strategies of optimizing store efficiency and managing costs, which were emphasized in earlier expansion plans.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the operational changes Dollar General implemented in 2024 regarding self-checkout systems and how that relates to their broader expansion and store management strategies from earlier years.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage mentions in \"Operations\" section that in the first half of 2024, Dollar General shut down self-checkout in more than half of its stores due to losses from theft. That's a key point for the first part of the question.\n\nNow, the second part is about how this relates to their broader expansion and store management strategies from earlier years. Looking at the earlier parts of the passage, there's mention of expansion plans in 2019 and 2020, like opening new stores, remodeling, and relocating. Also, in 2024, they had plans to remove pOpshelf stores inside DG Market stores. The shutdown of self-checkouts might be part of a strategy to reduce losses and focus on store efficiency, which could tie into their expansion efforts by optimizing existing stores rather than just opening more. \n\nI need to check if there are any direct links between the self-checkout changes and earlier strategies. The passage mentions that in 2024, they shut down self-checkouts because of theft losses, which is an operational change. The broader strategies include expanding stores, remodeling, and managing existing stores. The shutdown could be part of a shift towards more controlled store management, possibly to improve profitability, which aligns with their expansion goals by ensuring existing stores are efficient before expanding further.\n\nCitations: The self-checkout info is in [S119]. The expansion strategies are in [S68] (2020 plans), [S70] (hiring), [S71] (expansion to states), [S73] (pOpshelf), and [S79] (removing pOpshelf in 2024). The 2019 fiscal year expansion is in [S99] and [S100]. \n\nSo, the answer should mention the shutdown of self-checkouts in 2024 due to theft, citing [S119], and link it to earlier expansion and store management strategies like remodeling, opening new stores, and adjusting store formats (pOpshelf removal), citing the relevant sections."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the sustainability initiatives Dollar General undertook by 2024 and how they align with their broader environmental goals. I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the supporting context. In Passage 1, under the \"Environmental Impact\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"Dollar General has implemented several sustainability initiatives as of 2024.\" That's a key point. Then it mentions partnering with the Arbor Day Foundation since 2021 to restore forests and plant trees. Another point is their goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2026 and 30% per square foot by 2031. They also mention recycling efforts avoiding 1.1 million metric tons of GHG emissions through initiatives like cardboard backhauling.\n\nNow, I need to check if these initiatives align with broader environmental goals. The passage doesn't explicitly mention broader goals beyond the specific targets listed. However, the initiatives like tree planting, emission reductions, and recycling programs are typical components of environmental sustainability strategies. The user might be expecting that these initiatives align with common environmental goals like reducing carbon footprint, promoting reforestation, and waste reduction. Since the source doesn't specify other goals, I should stick to the information given.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. The sentences about the Arbor Day Foundation are [S112] and [S113]. The emission targets are [S114], and the recycling efforts are [S115]. The broader environmental goals aren't explicitly detailed, so maybe the answer should note that the initiatives themselves are part of their goals. Wait, the question asks how the initiatives align with the broader goals mentioned. But the passage only lists the specific initiatives and their targets. There's no separate mention of broader goals. So perhaps the answer is that the initiatives like tree planting, emission reductions, and recycling align with general environmental sustainability objectives, even if the source doesn't specify more details. \n\nI should structure the answer with each relevant sentence and their citations. Make sure not to add any information not in the context. Also, check for any other possible sentences. The rest of the passages talk about store expansions, private brands, board of directors, etc., which aren't relevant here. So the key sentences are in the Environmental Impact section of Passage 1."

[S74] In April 2021, the company said it was planning to hire 20,000 employees, less than the number hired in 2020 (50,000). [S75] On 5 March 2022, Dollar General opened its first store in the state of Idaho, located in Athol. [S76] On 12 October 2023, Dollar General announced the return of former CEO Todd Vasos, who replaced Jeff Owen. [S77] Chairman Michael Calbert said in a statement, \u201cAt this time the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward\". [S78] In October 2024, it was announced that there are plans for all p0pshelf stores inside DG Market stores to be removed. [S79] ## Major sponsorships\n\n\n### Auto racing\n\nFor several years, Dollar General has had a connection with motorsports, particularly in NASCAR. [S80] The company has previously been a primary sponsor for Joe Gibbs Racing. [S81] Dollar General sponsored Brian Vickers in the Nationwide Series in 2013. [S82] Dollar General became a primary sponsor for Matt Kenseth in the Sprint Cup Series starting in 2013. [S83] Dollar General and Turner (formerly Braun Racing) have been partnered together since 2008, with the team previously sponsoring cars for Frank Cicci Racing and Kevin Harvick Incorporated. [S84] In 2010, Dollar General sponsored some races in the Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports, with Kyle Busch in the No. [S85] 18 Toyota Tundra, and sponsored Kyle Busch's Motorsports No. [S86] 51 Toyota Tundra for four races in 2014, with Busch driving three and Erik Jones driving one. [S87] Dollar General was the title sponsor for Nationwide Series races held in Charlotte every fall, Chicagoland every summer, and Phoenix in the spring. [S88] On May 23, 2016, Dollar General announced it would withdraw its sponsorship from NASCAR at the end of the 2016 season. [S89] Dollar General has also been active in the IndyCar Series since 2008, serving initially as the primary sponsor for owner/driver Sarah Fisher's Sarah Fisher Racing team. [S90] In 2010, both Fisher and Graham Rahal drove part-time for the team, finishing 9th at the Honda Grand Prix of St. [S91] Petersburg. [S92] Fisher also led the field at the Peak Antifreeze & Motor Oil Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. [S93] In 2011, Dollar General continued to sponsor Sarah Fisher Racing; the team was still part-time, but Ed Carpenter drove for nines races starting at the 2011 Indianapolis 500. [S94] Dollar General ceased its sponsorship of Sarah Fisher Racing in 2012. [S95] ### Sports\n\nDollar General became the sponsor of the Dollar General Bowl, formerly the GoDaddy Bowl, in Mobile, Alabama, on August 17, 2016.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about leadership changes at Dollar General in 2023 and how the board justified it according to the source context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find any mentions of leadership changes in 2023. Let me scan through the text. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a sentence that says: \"On 12 October 2023, Dollar General announced the return of former CEO Todd Vasos, who replaced Jeff Owen.\" That's a key point. So the leadership change was Todd Vasos returning as CEO, replacing Jeff Owen. \n\nNext, the board's justification. The same passage has a quote from Chairman Michael Calbert: \u201cAt this time the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward\". So the justification given by the board is to restore stability and confidence.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. The rest of the passages talk about other things like store expansions, sustainability, etc., but nothing else about 2023 leadership changes. \n\nSo the answer should mention Todd Vasos replacing Jeff Owen and the board's statement about stability and confidence. The citations would be [S77] for the announcement and [S78] for the justification. \n\nI need to structure the response with <statement> tags and cite correctly. Make sure each sentence has its citations. Let me put it all together."

      "answer": "<statement>Dollar General's strategic decisions, such as store closures and distribution center expansions, were part of its operational restructuring and growth strategy. For instance, the closure of over 400 stores under the \"EZ Stores\" evaluation model (S42) aimed to optimize profitability by relocating or closing locations that failed criteria like profitability and infrastructure (S41). These closures coincided with financial challenges, including a $162 million settlement for accounting irregularities in 2001 (S140) and earnings restatements due to financial misreporting (S141).

[S52] In September 2015, the City Council in Janesville, Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. [S53] The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center. [S54] On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017.

[S142] ### OSHA fines\n\nIn November 2014, Dollar General was fined $51,700 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following an inspection of a Brooklyn, Mississippi, branch of the store. [S143] The statement from OSHA noted that Dollar General had had repeated health and safety violations: \"Since 2009, OSHA has conducted 72 inspections of Dollar General nationwide. [S144] Of those inspections, 39 have resulted in citations.\" In April 2016, OSHA reported that further citations had been given to the store for exposing employees to the risk of electrical hazards due to missing face plates on electrical outlets. [S145] The store was fined $107,620. [S146] In December 2016, OSHA noted that some Dollar General stores continued to block fire exits with merchandise in disregard of safety violations, resulting in several fines.

[S148] Specifically, OSHA cited the company for failing to keep receiving areas clean and orderly and for stacking materials in an unsafe manner. [S149] These hazards exposed workers to slips, trips, and being struck by objects. [S150] OSHA also issued citations for exposing workers to fire and entrapment hazards by failing to keep exit routes and electrical panels clear and unobstructed. [S151] Dollar General's pattern of disregarding worker safety was apparent at five other Southeast locations. [S152] In February 2022, OSHA proposed $1,048,309 in penalties after inspections at three locations in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia, found similar hazards. [S153] At another Mobile location, a December 2021 inspection led OSHA to propose $321,827 in penalties for exposing workers to slip and trip hazards and not keeping the main storeroom orderly to allow a safe exit during an emergency. [S154] In March 2023 it was reported that Dollar General was added to OSHA's severe-violator enforcement program.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Dollar General's strategic decisions, like store closures and distribution center expansions, interacted with its financial and safety challenges as per the source.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. There are two passages here. Let me go through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with Passage 1. Sentence S37 mentions the CEO's resignation and stock acquisition. S38 says the stock was bought by private equity. S39 explains the acquisition by an investment group. S40 talks about assessing locations with the \"EZ Stores\" model. S41 details the evaluation criteria, and S42 mentions closing stores that didn't pass. S43 states over 400 stores closed. Then there's the IPO in 2009 (S44), starting to sell cigarettes in 2013 (S45), and distribution centers opening in 2014 (S46), 2016 (S51), and others. There's also the 2017 distribution center in Jackson, Georgia (S60), and the 16th in Amsterdam (S61). The expansion of distribution centers might relate to their strategic decisions.\n\nNow, looking at Passage 2. There's mention of financial irregularities in S140 and S141, where they paid a settlement and restated earnings. Then OSHA fines in several sentences (S143-S154) about safety violations. The financial issues include past accounting problems, and the safety issues involve multiple citations and fines over the years.\n\nSo, the strategic decisions like closing underperforming stores (S42, S43) could be a response to financial challenges, maybe to cut costs or improve profitability. Expanding distribution centers (S46, S51, S60, S61) might be to support growth or improve logistics, but could also relate to financial strategies. However, the financial challenges mentioned include past accounting issues and restatements (S140, S141), which might be separate from the store closures and distribution expansions. The safety challenges are more about OSHA violations, which are separate but could be part of the company's operational challenges. \n\nThe interaction would be that store closures (strategic) might be a financial move to streamline operations, while distribution expansions could be part of growth strategy. However, the financial challenges (accounting issues) and safety issues (OSHA fines) are separate problems that the company faced, possibly affecting their strategic decisions. For example, financial irregularities might have led to a need for restructuring, which could involve closing stores. But the passage doesn't explicitly link the store closures and distribution expansions directly to the financial or safety issues. The OSHA fines are about safety, which is a different aspect. \n\nSo, the answer would need to connect the strategic moves (store closures, distribution centers) with the financial and safety issues mentioned. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that the closures were due to financial issues, but the closures were part of the \"EZ Stores\" assessment (S40-42). The financial challenges include past accounting issues and the IPO in 2009. The OSHA fines are separate but show safety issues. The answer should note that while the strategic decisions (closures, expansions) are part of their growth and operational strategy, the financial challenges (accounting issues) and safety issues (OSHA violations) were separate problems that the company faced, possibly influencing their strategies but not directly linked in the provided context."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Dollar General's expansion into new product lines like cigarettes and produce aligned with its competitive strategies and community impact. I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at Passage 1, there's a mention that in 2013, Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to Family Dollar's move in 2012 (S45). That seems like a competitive strategy to keep up with competitors. Then, in Passage 2, there's info about expanding produce assortments in 2020 (S137). But the user is asking about alignment with competitive strategies and community impact.\n\nFor competitive strategies, the cigarette expansion is directly tied to competing with Family Dollar. That's a clear point. As for community impact, Passage 2 talks about dollar stores being in cash-strapped communities but also contributing to food deserts (S133). However, the expansion into produce might aim to improve community access, but the passage also mentions that dollar stores might stifle local competition (S136). But the question is about how the expansion aligned with their strategies. The produce expansion could be part of their strategy to offer more services, like the DGX stores with coffee stations (S57). However, the exact connection between produce and competitive strategy isn't directly stated. The community impact part might be mixed, as they provide services but also have negative effects. But the answer needs to cite the relevant sentences. So, S45 for cigarettes and S137 for produce. Also, maybe S133 and S136 for community impact. Wait, the question is about how the expansion aligned with their strategies. So the competitive strategy part is covered by S45. The community impact might be addressed in S133 and S136, but the expansion into produce might be part of their strategy to serve communities, but the passages don't explicitly link produce expansion to community impact. Maybe the DGX concept (S57) is part of their strategy to target urban areas, which could be a competitive move. But the user specifically mentioned cigarettes and produce. So I'll focus on those. The answer should mention that expanding into cigarettes was a response to competitors, aligning with competitive strategies. For community impact, the passages mention both providing services and contributing to food deserts. But the exact alignment isn't clear. Maybe the answer should note that while they expanded products to compete, their community impact is debated. But need to stick to the citations provided. So the statements would be: S45 for competitive strategy, and S133 and S136 for community impact. However, the produce expansion in S137 might not directly tie to community impact. Need to check. The user's question is about how the expansion aligned with strategies and community impact. So the answer would need to connect the expansion to both aspects. But the passages might not have explicit links. So perhaps the answer is that expanding into cigarettes was a competitive move (S45), and the produce expansion (S137) might be part of their strategy to offer more services, but community impact is discussed in S133 and S136. However, the user might expect that the expansion into new products is part of their competitive strategy, and the community impact is both positive (serving communities) and negative (food deserts). But the answer needs to be based on the given citations. So the final answer would cite S45 for competitive strategy and S133/S136 for community impact."

[S44] Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009, for an initial public offering of up to $750 million, turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation. [S45] In 2013, Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012. [S46] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014, in Bethel, Pennsylvania, to serve the Northeast and Midwest stores. [S47] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7\u00a0billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. [S48] The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.

[S51] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas, on June 6, 2016, with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs. [S52] In September 2015, the City Council in Janesville, Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. [S53] The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center. [S54] On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. [S55] Dollar General operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016. [S56] In January 2017, Dollar General opened a concept store in Nashville, Tennessee, called DGX. [S57] The DGX store concept focuses on urban shoppers and is geared toward instant-consumption services such as coffee stations and soda fountains. [S58] The following month another DGX store opened in Raleigh, North Carolina, and in September a third DGX opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [S59] As of May 2020, Dollar General operated 12 DGX locations in nine states. [S60] In Jackson, Georgia, Dollar General opened its 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding states. [S61] In 2017, Dollar General began construction for its 16th distribution center, in Amsterdam, New York. [S62] The distribution center was to cost $91 million and was expected to create 400 jobs in Montgomery County, New York. [S63] Dollar General planned to open 900 new stores in 2018. [S64] The distribution center became fully operational in 2019. [S65] Also in 2017, Dollar General acquired stores from Dollar Express, a spinoff from the Family Dollar\u2013Dollar Tree deal, and converted the store. [S66] In September 2019, Dollar General celebrated the grand opening of its 16,000th store, in Panama City, Florida, following damage sustained from Hurricane Michael in October 2018. [S67] To commemorate the opening, Dollar General presented two $16,000 checks in partnership with Kellogg's to two local elementary schools displaced from the hurricane.",

[S133] The rapid growth in dollar stores across the US has created food deserts and a \"dollar store belt\". [S134] After originally granting them local tax incentives, a number of municipalities have been adding zoning bylaws to discourage dollar stores.

[S138] In February 2019, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, published a story which found that the quality of fruits and vegetables at dollar stores is just as good as at regular grocery stores. [S139] ### Financial irregularities\n\nOn April 30, 2001, Dollar General Corp was judged liable for making false statements or failing to disclose adverse facts about the company's financial results, and paid $162 million for settlement. [S140] The company also announced a restatement of its earnings for the previous three fiscal years, due to accounting irregularities including allegations of fraudulent behavior. [S141] On March 3, 2005, Dollar General restated its results for 2000 through 2003, due to a clarification of lease-accounting matters issued by the SEC. [S142] ### OSHA fines\n\nIn November 2014, Dollar General was fined $51,700 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following an inspection of a Brooklyn, Mississippi, branch of the store. [S143] The statement from OSHA noted that Dollar General had had repeated health and safety violations: \"Since 2009, OSHA has conducted 72 inspections of Dollar General nationwide. [S144] Of those inspections, 39 have resulted in citations.\" In April 2016, OSHA reported that further citations had been given to the store for exposing employees to the risk of electrical hazards due to missing face plates on electrical outlets. [S145] The store was fined $107,620. [S146] In December 2016, OSHA noted that some Dollar General stores continued to block fire exits with merchandise in disregard of safety violations, resulting in several fines. [S147] Inspections at Dollar General stores in 2022 in Pembroke in February, and Hogansville and Smyrna\u1d9c\u02e1\u1d43\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 in March, identified four willful and seven repeat violations. [S148] Specifically, OSHA cited the company for failing to keep receiving areas clean and orderly and for stacking materials in an unsafe manner. [S149] These hazards exposed workers to slips, trips, and being struck by objects. [S150] OSHA also issued citations for exposing workers to fire and entrapment hazards by failing to keep exit routes and electrical panels clear and unobstructed. [S151] Dollar General's pattern of disregarding worker safety was apparent at five other Southeast locations. [S152] In February 2022, OSHA proposed $1,048,309 in penalties after inspections at three locations in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia, found similar hazards. [S153] At another Mobile location, a December 2021 inspection led OSHA to propose $321,827 in penalties for exposing workers to slip and trip hazards and not keeping the main storeroom orderly to allow a safe exit during an emergency. [S154] In March 2023 it was reported that Dollar General was added to OSHA's severe-violator enforcement program."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key financial and regulatory challenges faced by Dollar General and how they impacted the company's public perception and operations. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passages for mentions of financial issues. In Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Financial irregularities.\" It mentions that on April 30, 2001, Dollar General was judged liable for false statements or failing to disclose adverse facts, leading to a $162 million settlement. They also restated earnings for three fiscal years due to accounting irregularities and fraudulent behavior. Then, in March 2005, they restated results again because of lease-accounting matters from the SEC. These financial issues likely hurt their public perception, making them look unreliable or unethical.\n\nNext, looking at regulatory challenges. The OSHA fines are mentioned multiple times. For example, in November 2014, they were fined $51,700 for health and safety violations. There were repeated inspections with citations, and in 2022, they had significant fines and were added to OSHA's severe-violator program. These regulatory issues would damage their reputation as a company that doesn't prioritize worker safety, potentially leading to loss of trust and possible legal repercussions.\n\nAnother point is the acquisition by private equity in 2007. While that's more of a corporate move, it might relate to financial challenges. The company went private, which could be a response to financial pressures, and then went public again in 2009. The closure of over 400 stores in 2007 as part of the transition to private ownership might indicate operational challenges, possibly due to financial strain.\n\nAlso, the part about Dollar General being part of creating food deserts and facing zoning bylaws in some municipalities. This is more about public perception and regulatory challenges. The study from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance says they create fewer jobs and hurt local competition, which could affect their public image as a negative force in communities.\n\nThe financial irregularities and OSHA violations are the main points. The citations for these issues would impact both their operations (having to pay fines, improve safety) and public perception (seen as irresponsible or unsafe). The closure of stores and acquisitions might also be part of their operational challenges, but the main financial and regulatory issues are the settlements and OSHA fines.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the financial irregularities are in S140, S141, S142. The OSHA fines are in S143-S154. The part about food deserts is S131-S135. I should structure the answer with each key challenge and the relevant citations."

Closing stores could affect market presence by reducing the number of locations, but maybe they focused on more profitable areas. However, closing stores might also hurt community relations, especially if those stores were in need.\n\nLooking at the distribution centers: there are several mentions of new distribution centers opening, like in Bethel, Pennsylvania [S46], San Antonio [S51], and others. More distribution centers might improve efficiency and market presence by better serving stores. However, the context doesn't directly link these to community relations. \n\nPassage 2 discusses community impact. It mentions that dollar stores, including Dollar General, are sometimes seen as filling a need in cash-strapped communities but are also criticized for perpetuating economic issues [S132]. The growth of dollar stores has created food deserts and a \"dollar store belt\" [S133]. Some municipalities added zoning laws to discourage them [S134]. Also, a study says dollar stores create fewer and lower-wage jobs than independent grocers [S135], which could negatively affect community relations by not providing good jobs. However, the context doesn't directly tie these points to the EZ Stores policy specifically, but maybe the store closures and distribution center expansions are part of the broader strategy.\n\nThe EZ Stores evaluation led to closures, which might have reduced market presence in some areas but could have streamlined operations. However, closing stores in certain communities might harm relations. On the other hand, opening new distribution centers might improve supply chain efficiency, aiding market presence. But the community relations aspect is more about the negative perceptions of dollar stores in general, not just the EZ Stores.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The EZ Stores part is in [S40]-[S43]. The community relations aspects are in Passage 2, so [S132]-[S135]. However, the question specifically asks about the approach including EZ Stores. So the closures from EZ Stores would be part of the market presence (reducing stores) and community relations (closing stores in communities). The distribution centers might be part of market presence but not directly linked to community relations in the context provided.\n\nSo the answer should mention that the EZ Stores evaluation led to store closures, affecting market presence by reducing locations, and possibly harming community relations by closing stores in certain areas. The distribution centers might have helped maintain or expand market presence through better logistics. The community relations part also includes the broader criticisms from Passage 2, but the direct link to EZ Stores is the closures."

    "[S1] Dollar General\n\n\n# Dollar General\n\n\n\n**Dollar General Corporation** is an American chain of discount stores headquartered in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. [S2] As of January 8, 2024, Dollar General operated 19,643 stores in the contiguous United States and Mexico. [S3] The company began in 1939 in Scottsville, Kentucky, as a family-owned business called J.L. [S4] Turner and Son, owned by James Luther Turner and Cal Turner. [S5] In 1955, the name changed to Dollar General Corporation, and in 1968 the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange. [S6] The Fortune 500 recognized Dollar General in 1999, and in 2020 it reached #112 on the list. [S7] Dollar General has grown to become one of the most profitable stores in the rural United States, with revenue reaching around $27 billion in 2019. [S8] The company and its business practices have been subject to criticism, particularly regarding how it may be creating and perpetuating food deserts and stifling local businesses while offering fewer and lower-paying jobs. [S9] ## History\n\n\n### J.L. [S10] Turner and Son: 1939\u20131964\n\nDollar General has its origin in Scottsville, Kentucky, with James Luther \"J.L.\" Turner and his son Cal Turner. [S11] James Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when James was only 11. [S12] James quit school to work on the family farm, helping to provide for his mother and siblings, and subsequently never completed his education. [S13] After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, James became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. [S14] James left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. [S15] During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. [S16] Cal accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills. [S17] In October 1939, James and Cal opened **J.L. [S18] Turner and Son** with an initial investment of $5,000 each (equivalent to $110,000 in 2023). [S19] The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. [S20] By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. [S21] In 1955, Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky, into the first Dollar General Store. [S22] In 1964, J.L. [S23] Turner died, leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him. [S24] ### 1968\u20132002\n\nThe company Cal Turner co-founded went public as **Dollar General Corporation** in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. [S25] In 1977, Cal Turner Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as a third-generation Turner, succeeded his father as CEO of Dollar General. [S26] In 1989, Cal Sr. [S27] retired as chairman and the company headquarters were moved to Tennessee. [S28] Under his son's leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. [S29] In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia. [S30] In 2000, Dollar General opened a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. [S31] By the end of 2000, sales at Dollar General exceeded $4\u00a0billion. [S32] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia, was closed in April 2000 and operations were moved to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida. [S33] Cal Jr. [S34] retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue on April 2, 2003. [S35] ### 2003\u2013present\n\nDollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003. [S36] In 2004, Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.",
    "[S37] On June 21, 2007, CEO David Perdue announced his resignation, leaving David Bere as interim CEO. [S38] One month later, all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. [S39] An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity, and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for $6.9\u00a0billion. [S40] As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as \"EZ Stores\". [S41] This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. [S42] Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. [S43] Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative. [S44] Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009, for an initial public offering of up to $750 million, turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation. [S45] In 2013, Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012. [S46] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014, in Bethel, Pennsylvania, to serve the Northeast and Midwest stores. [S47] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7\u00a0billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. [S48] The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree. [S49] On June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. [S50] Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016. [S51] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas, on June 6, 2016, with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs. [S52] In September 2015, the City Council in Janesville, Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. [S53] The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center. [S54] On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. [S55] Dollar General operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016. [S56] In January 2017, Dollar General opened a concept store in Nashville, Tennessee, called DGX. [S57] The DGX store concept focuses on urban shoppers and is geared toward instant-consumption services such as coffee stations and soda fountains. [S58] The following month another DGX store opened in Raleigh, North Carolina, and in September a third DGX opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [S59] As of May 2020, Dollar General operated 12 DGX locations in nine states. [S60] In Jackson, Georgia, Dollar General opened its 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding states. [S61] In 2017, Dollar General began construction for its 16th distribution center, in Amsterdam, New York. [S62] The distribution center was to cost $91 million and was expected to create 400 jobs in Montgomery County, New York. [S63] Dollar General planned to open 900 new stores in 2018. [S64] The distribution center became fully operational in 2019. [S65] Also in 2017, Dollar General acquired stores from Dollar Express, a spinoff from the Family Dollar\u2013Dollar Tree deal, and converted the store. [S66] In September 2019, Dollar General celebrated the grand opening of its 16,000th store, in Panama City, Florida, following damage sustained from Hurricane Michael in October 2018. [S67] To commemorate the opening, Dollar General presented two $16,000 checks in partnership with Kellogg's to two local elementary schools displaced from the hurricane.",
    "[S68] On December 5, 2019, Dollar General announced plans for fiscal 2020 that included the opening of 1,000 new stores, remodeling of 1,500 mature stores, and relocation of 80 stores. [S69] In February 2020, Dollar General announced plans to create 8,000 net new career opportunities in fiscal year 2020. [S70] Dollar General expanded to 46 states in 2020 with the addition of new stores in Wyoming in March and Washington in April. [S71] In late May 2020, two Dollar General stores were destroyed by arson during the George Floyd riots in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, and three others had property damage. [S72] In October 2020, Dollar General opened its first pOpshelf stores in Hendersonville and Clarksville, Tennessee, selling mostly items costing less than $5. [S73] By the end of 2021, the company planned 50 free-standing pOpshelf locations and 25 store-within-a-store locations inside Dollar General Market stores. [S74] In April 2021, the company said it was planning to hire 20,000 employees, less than the number hired in 2020 (50,000). [S75] On 5 March 2022, Dollar General opened its first store in the state of Idaho, located in Athol. [S76] On 12 October 2023, Dollar General announced the return of former CEO Todd Vasos, who replaced Jeff Owen. [S77] Chairman Michael Calbert said in a statement, \u201cAt this time the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward\". [S78] In October 2024, it was announced that there are plans for all p0pshelf stores inside DG Market stores to be removed. [S79] ## Major sponsorships\n\n\n### Auto racing\n\nFor several years, Dollar General has had a connection with motorsports, particularly in NASCAR. [S80] The company has previously been a primary sponsor for Joe Gibbs Racing. [S81] Dollar General sponsored Brian Vickers in the Nationwide Series in 2013. [S82] Dollar General became a primary sponsor for Matt Kenseth in the Sprint Cup Series starting in 2013. [S83] Dollar General and Turner (formerly Braun Racing) have been partnered together since 2008, with the team previously sponsoring cars for Frank Cicci Racing and Kevin Harvick Incorporated. [S84] In 2010, Dollar General sponsored some races in the Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports, with Kyle Busch in the No. [S85] 18 Toyota Tundra, and sponsored Kyle Busch's Motorsports No. [S86] 51 Toyota Tundra for four races in 2014, with Busch driving three and Erik Jones driving one. [S87] Dollar General was the title sponsor for Nationwide Series races held in Charlotte every fall, Chicagoland every summer, and Phoenix in the spring. [S88] On May 23, 2016, Dollar General announced it would withdraw its sponsorship from NASCAR at the end of the 2016 season. [S89] Dollar General has also been active in the IndyCar Series since 2008, serving initially as the primary sponsor for owner/driver Sarah Fisher's Sarah Fisher Racing team. [S90] In 2010, both Fisher and Graham Rahal drove part-time for the team, finishing 9th at the Honda Grand Prix of St. [S91] Petersburg. [S92] Fisher also led the field at the Peak Antifreeze & Motor Oil Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway. [S93] In 2011, Dollar General continued to sponsor Sarah Fisher Racing; the team was still part-time, but Ed Carpenter drove for nines races starting at the 2011 Indianapolis 500. [S94] Dollar General ceased its sponsorship of Sarah Fisher Racing in 2012. [S95] ### Sports\n\nDollar General became the sponsor of the Dollar General Bowl, formerly the GoDaddy Bowl, in Mobile, Alabama, on August 17, 2016. [S96] In May 2019, Dollar General withdrew its title sponsorship of the Mobile bowl game.

    "[S99] By the end of its 2019 fiscal year, Dollar General offered its produce assortments in more than 650 stores, with plans to expand its produce offerings to an additional 400 stores in fiscal 2020. [S100] ### Private brands\n\nDollar General has used its abbreviation, the letters \"DG\", as a store brand for \"inexpensive\" household products sold through its stores; the brand is in the process of being phased out for most products as of the early 2020s. [S101] DG is also the company's NYSE ticker symbol. [S102] Dollar General private brands include Clover Valley (groceries), Good & Smart (health foods), Smart & Simple (a low-end discount brand), Sweet Smiles (bulk candy), Nature's Menu, Forever Pals and Heartland Farms (pet food and products, formerly EverPet), Gentle Steps (diapers, training pants, and wipes), Studio Selection (beauty and skin care), Believe Beauty (beauty care and makeup), Root to End (hair care), TrueLiving (housewares and laundry), Comfort Bay (towels, blankets, and pillows), Open Trails (men's apparel), Mission Ridge (blue jeans), Zone Pro (sportswear), Rexall (health care, under license from McKesson Corporation), Composure (adult diapers and incontinence pads), Breeze (feminine hygiene), ProEssentials (hardware), DriveMXD (automotive), OfficeHub (office supplies), and Bobbie Brooks (women's apparel, under license).

[S105] Rexall vitamins and supplements began appearing at Dollar General stores in March and by fall 2010 a full line of Rexall products was available at Dollar General. [S106] ## Corporate affairs\n\n\n### Board of directors\n\nDollar General Board of Directors as of June 2024 are: Michael M. [S107] Calbert (Chairman of the Board), Todd Vasos (CEO), Warren Bryant, Patricia Fili-Krushel, Timothy I. [S108] McGuire, Ana Chadwick, David Rowland, Debra A. [S109] Sandler, and Ralph E. [S110] Santana. [S111] ### Environmental Impact\n\nDollar General has implemented several sustainability initiatives as of 2024. [S112] The company has partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation since 2021 to restore over 321 acres of forest and plant more than 96,000 trees near the Mississippi River in Louisiana and Mississippi. [S113] Additionally, Dollar General aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2026 and 30% per square foot by 2031. [S114] They have also made significant progress in recycling, avoiding more than 1.1 million metric tons of GHG emissions through various programs such as the cardboard backhauling initiative. [S115] ## Operations\n\nDollar General has more than 19,400 stores in 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Mexico, and approximately 158,000 employees. [S116] Dollar General also has 17 distribution centers in 16 states. [S117] Since 2017, DG has opened stores in North Dakota, Wyoming, and Washington. [S118] As of early 2025, only two states lacked DG stores: Alaska, and Hawaii. [S119] In the first half of 2024, Dollar General shut down self-checkout in more than half of its stores across the US because of losses from theft.",

[S121] Dollar General brand products are manufactured under the Dolgencorp subsidiary. [S122] ### Dollar General Global Sourcing Ltd. [S123] In 2004, a Dollar General office was opened in Hong Kong to oversee the global sourcing operations through exporting and importing products of Dollar General\u2013related goods. [S124] ### Dollar General Literacy Foundation\n\nSince 1993, Dollar General has provided funding of literacy and education programs through its subsidiary Dollar General Literacy Foundation. [S125] Every year the Foundation awards funds to nonprofit organizations, schools, and libraries within a 15-mile radius of a Dollar General store or distribution center. [S126] It has awarded more than $182 million in grants to literacy organizations, which have helped more than 11 million individuals learn to read, prepare for the high school equivalency test, or learn English. [S127] In 2020, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation awarded $8.6 million to approximately 970 nonprofit organizations, schools, and libraries, its largest one-day grant announcement. [S128] The Foundation celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2018. [S129] In April 2022, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation announced an approximately $9.2 million commitment to support literacy within the surrounding communities.\u1d9c\u02e1\u1d43\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 $8.2 million was earmarked for the spring grants to support family literacy programs across the country, while the remaining $1 million was pledged to the DonorsChoose program. [S130] ## Controversies\n\n\n### Perpetuating economic distress",
    "[S131] Dollar General, along with other dollar store chains, while \"sometimes [filling] a need in cash-strapped communities\" where supermarkets have closed, are regarded not \"merely a byproduct of economic distress. [S132] They're a cause of it.\" Dollar store chains, in \"capitalizing on a series of powerful economic and social forces\u2014white flight, the recent recession, the so-called \"retail apocalypse\"\u2014all of which have opened up gaping holes in food access...might not be causing these inequalities per se, they appear to be perpetuating them\". [S133] The rapid growth in dollar stores across the US has created food deserts and a \"dollar store belt\". [S134] After originally granting them local tax incentives, a number of municipalities have been adding zoning bylaws to discourage dollar stores. [S135] \u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48) According to a study done by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, dollar stores tend to create fewer and lower-wage jobs than independent grocery stores. [S136] The report claims that dollar stores stifle local competition, thereby hurting the communities they are serving. [S137] In March 2020, Dollar General announced plans for its 2020 fiscal year to begin offering produce assortments at approximately 400 stores in addition to the 650 stores that already did so. [S138] In February 2019, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, published a story which found that the quality of fruits and vegetables at dollar stores is just as good as at regular grocery stores. [S139] ### Financial irregularities\n\nOn April 30, 2001, Dollar General Corp was judged liable for making false statements or failing to disclose adverse facts about the company's financial results, and paid $162 million for settlement. [S140] The company also announced a restatement of its earnings for the previous three fiscal years, due to accounting irregularities including allegations of fraudulent behavior. [S141] On March 3, 2005, Dollar General restated its results for 2000 through 2003, due to a clarification of lease-accounting matters issued by the SEC. [S142] ### OSHA fines\n\nIn November 2014, Dollar General was fined $51,700 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following an inspection of a Brooklyn, Mississippi, branch of the store. [S143] The statement from OSHA noted that Dollar General had had repeated health and safety violations: \"Since 2009, OSHA has conducted 72 inspections of Dollar General nationwide. [S144] Of those inspections, 39 have resulted in citations.\" In April 2016, OSHA reported that further citations had been given to the store for exposing employees to the risk of electrical hazards due to missing face plates on electrical outlets. [S145] The store was fined $107,620. [S146] In December 2016, OSHA noted that some Dollar General stores continued to block fire exits with merchandise in disregard of safety violations, resulting in several fines. [S147] Inspections at Dollar General stores in 2022 in Pembroke in February, and Hogansville and Smyrna\u1d9c\u02e1\u1d43\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 in March, identified four willful and seven repeat violations. [S148] Specifically, OSHA cited the company for failing to keep receiving areas clean and orderly and for stacking materials in an unsafe manner. [S149] These hazards exposed workers to slips, trips, and being struck by objects. [S150] OSHA also issued citations for exposing workers to fire and entrapment hazards by failing to keep exit routes and electrical panels clear and unobstructed. [S151] Dollar General's pattern of disregarding worker safety was apparent at five other Southeast locations. [S152] In February 2022, OSHA proposed $1,048,309 in penalties after inspections at three locations in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia, found similar hazards. [S153] At another Mobile location, a December 2021 inspection led OSHA to propose $321,827 in penalties for exposing workers to slip and trip hazards and not keeping the main storeroom orderly to allow a safe exit during an emergency. [S154] In March 2023 it was reported that Dollar General was added to OSHA's severe-violator enforcement program.",
    "[S155] ### *Dollar General Corp. [S156] v. [S157] Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians*\n\n\n### Pricing irregularities\n\nIn March 2023 a Barron's article found that North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arizona together had fined Dollar General more than $1 million for price irregularities during 2021 and 2022, and the company was also facing multiple potential class-action lawsuits relating to the issue. [S158] In 2019, Dollar General was fined $1.75 million by the state of Vermont over pricing irregularities for charging a higher price for products at the register than was advertised at the shelf. [S159] During 2022, the State of Ohio brought a lawsuit for deceptive pricing. [S160] ### Rural and Small Town Resistance\n\nThere has been a trend of citizens in small towns organizing to prevent development of Dollar General in towns with a strong rural identity. [S161] The Institute for Local Self Reliance, ILSR, assists communities in rejecting Dollar Store development. [S162] A report by ILSR, The Dollar Store Invasion details the tactics of the dollar chains and the rising grassroots opposition."
