      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key milestones in Expert360's early development, including founding, initial funding, expansion, and how these show their growth strategy.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences with citations. Let me go through each part.\n\nStarting with the founding. Sentence S1 mentions that Expert360 was co-founded by Bridget Loudon and Emily Yue and is based in Sydney. Then S8 talks about the history, stating the launch date as July 1, 2013. So founding would be S1 and S8.\n\nNext, initial funding. S9 says they raised $1 million in their first funding round at the end of 2013. Then S10 mentions a $4.1 million round in 2015 with specific investors. So those are the funding milestones.\n\nExpansion efforts: S11 mentions the New York office opening in 2016. That's an expansion step.\n\nNow, how these reflect strategic growth. The founding in Sydney, then expanding to the US suggests a strategy to grow internationally. The funding rounds indicate they were able to secure investments, which would support their expansion. The mention of targeting senior consultants and clients like big companies might show they aimed for high-value clients and experts.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each milestone, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S2 and S3 talk about their role as a marketplace and innovation, but maybe those are more about their business model than early milestones. The question is about early development, so founding, funding, expansion. The history section (S8-S11) is key here.\n\nSo the answer should list founding (S1, S8), initial funding (S9), expansion (S11), and maybe the second funding round (S10). Also, mention the strategic growth trajectory based on these steps. Need to make sure each part is correctly cited."

Sentence S9 mentions the company was co-founded by Bridget Loudon and Emily Yue, and they raised $1 million in their first funding round at the end of 2013. So that's the first funding round. Then, in S10, there's a mention of a $4.1 million round in 2015 backed by Frontier Ventures, Rampersand, and some angel investors. Also, S11 says Allan Moss AO is a notable investor. \n\nThe question is about the role of notable investors. The passage doesn't explicitly state their role beyond mentioning their investments. But the funding rounds they participated in would be their role. So the first round had investors who provided $1M, and the second round had Frontier Ventures, Rampersand, and others. Allan Moss is noted as a notable investor. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The first funding round is S9. The second is S10. The investors in the second round are listed there, plus Allan Moss in S11. The user might be looking for the specific funding rounds (2013 and 2015) and the investors mentioned. \n\nSo the answer should mention the two funding rounds, the amounts, the investors involved, and note Allan Moss as a notable investor. Each part needs to be cited properly. Let me structure the statements accordingly."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about a strategic decision Expert360 made in 2016 and how it aligns with their broader objectives.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that in 2016, specifically March 30, Expert360 announced opening an office in New York City to expand their reach in the US. That's probably the strategic decision. \n\nNow, the next part is connecting this to their broader objectives. The context says Expert360 is an online marketplace aiming to match consultants with clients, known for innovative approaches in freelance markets. Their clients include big companies like Woolworths and Telstra, and they have a focus on senior consultants. Expanding to the US would align with growing their market presence and possibly increasing their client base and consultant network. \n\nLooking at the citations, the sentence about the New York office is [S11]. The broader objectives are mentioned in sentences [S1]-[S3], [S7], etc. But the specific alignment isn't directly stated. However, the expansion to the US would support their goal of being a digital network for consultants, as mentioned in [S2] and [S3]. So maybe citing those.\n\nWait, the user wants the answer to have citations. The strategic decision is in [S11]. Then, the alignment with objectives would reference the parts about their mission. The passage says they're an online marketplace (S2), innovative approach (S3), and clients range from small to big companies (S7). So maybe [S2][S3][S7] as citations for the alignment part.\n\nI need to structure the answer into statements. The first statement would state the decision with [S11]. The second statement explains how it aligns, citing the relevant sentences. Let me check again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The history section mentions the 2016 expansion, and the broader objectives are in the description part. Yes, that seems right."
