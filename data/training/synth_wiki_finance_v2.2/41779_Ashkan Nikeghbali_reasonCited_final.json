      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the academic positions Ashkan Nikeghbali has held at the University of Zurich and how they relate to his research areas in financial mathematics and probability theory.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passage again. \n\nIn the \"Academic career\" section, it mentions that he was appointed assistant professor at the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Zurich in March 2007. Then, he was promoted to Extraordinary Professor of Applied Mathematics there in 2009. Also, he holds the chair of Financial Mathematics at the University of Zurich, as stated in [S2]. \n\nNow, the question is about his positions at the University of Zurich. The chair of Financial Mathematics is definitely one. Then the assistant professor and Extraordinary Professor roles. I need to check if those are at the University of Zurich. The passage says \"Institute of Mathematics at the University of Zurich\" for the assistant professor position, and the Extraordinary Professor is also mentioned as being there. \n\nRegarding the research areas, the passage states in [S8] that his research focuses on financial mathematics, probability theory, and analytic number theory. The positions he holds, especially the chair of Financial Mathematics, directly relate to his research in that area. The roles as assistant and extraordinary professor would involve teaching and research in these fields. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is correctly cited. For example, the chair position is [S2], the assistant professor is [S7], and the promotion to Extraordinary Professor is [S7] as well? Wait, the text says \"In March 2007, Nikeghbali was appointed assistant professor... He was promoted to Extraordinary Professor... in 2009.\" So both are under [S7]? Or is the promotion a separate citation? Let me check the original passage again.\n\nLooking at the passage: [S7] says \"In March 2007, Nikeghbali was appointed assistant professor at the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Zurich. He was promoted to Extraordinary Professor of Applied Mathematics there in 2009.\" So both the appointment as assistant professor and the promotion to Extraordinary Professor are in [S7]. Therefore, both positions would cite [S7]. \n\nAdditionally, the chair of Financial Mathematics is [S2]. \n\nSo the answer should list the positions: assistant professor, Extraordinary Professor, and the chair. Each of these should be cited appropriately. The relation to research areas is covered in [S8], which mentions his focus on financial mathematics and probability theory. \n\nI need to structure each sentence with the correct citations. For example, the first sentence about the chair position cites [S2], the assistant professor and promotion cite [S7], and the research areas cite [S8]. \n\nI should also check if there are any other citations that might be relevant. The passage also mentions his research areas in the \"Research\" section, which is [S8]. The other parts about his PhD and other positions are not directly relevant here. \n\nSo the final answer would have statements about each position with their citations and a statement linking his positions to his research areas with [S8]."

[S9] In number theory, he, together with Chhaibi and Najnudel, introduced the concept of stochastic zeta function.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nNikeghbali supervised at least six PhD students during his time at the University of Zurich.
