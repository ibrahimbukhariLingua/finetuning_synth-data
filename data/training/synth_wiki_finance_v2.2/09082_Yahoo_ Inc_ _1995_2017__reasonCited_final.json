      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S136] On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo, an online advertising management platform. [S137] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. [S138] The service was launched in September 2008. [S139] In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft. [S140] But by 2013, this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share. [S141] On September 27, 2023, Yahoo partnered with Good-Loop to offer carbon neutral private marketplace (PMP) media opportunities to help advertisers be more sustainable. [S142] ### GeoPlanet\n\nYahoo offers cartographic and geographic services via GeoPlanet. [S143] ### Yahoo Next\n\nYahoo Next is an incubation ground for future Yahoo technologies currently undergoing testing. [S144] It contains forums for Yahoo users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo technologies. [S145] ### Yahoo BOSS\n\nYahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology. [S146] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol. [S147] In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). [S148] The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information. [S149] ### Yahoo Meme\n\nYahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku. [S150] ### Y!Connect\n\nY!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. [S151] The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. [S152] to help drive traffic to its site. [S153] ### Yahoo Accessibility\n\nYahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab. [S154] ### Yahoo Axis\n\nYahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. [S155] The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012. [S156] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension. [S157] ### Yahoo SearchMonkey\n\nYahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. [S158] The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. [S159] The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. [S160] Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters. [S161] Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008. [S162] ### Defunct services\n\nGeocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. [S163] At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web. [S164] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages. [S165] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive, OOcities.com, and other such databases. [S166] Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010. [S167] Yahoo 360\u00b0 was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009. [S168] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S43] Yahoo!'s initial public offering at the NASDAQ was on April 12, 1996, closing at US$33.00\u2014up 270 percent from the IPO price\u2014after peaking at $43.00 for the day. [S44] Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. [S45] However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001. [S46] Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. [S47] Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. [S48] In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. [S49] The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs. [S50] In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. [S51] Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it \"substantially undervalues\" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. [S52] Three years later, Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion. [S53] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009. [S54] In September 2011, she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company. [S55] In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. [S56] Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left. [S57] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. [S58] The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012. [S59] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. [S60] He also completely reorganized the company. [S61] On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group. [S62] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million. [S63] On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day. [S64] On May 19, 2013, the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. [S65] Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. [S66] The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. [S67] The *Wall Street Journal* stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for \"a thriving social-networking and communications hub.\" On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially. [S68] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013. [S69] On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated. [S70] Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. [S71] visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. [S72] The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr. [S73] In November 2014, Yahoo! [S74] announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million. [S75] On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris. [S76] ### Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase",

      ],
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Yahoo's acquisitions between 2012 and 2014 and how they aligned with their goals in digital advertising and social media.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, but the relevant info is probably in Passage 2 since it mentions acquisitions. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a mention of the acquisition of Tumblr on May 19, 2013, under S65 to S68. The context says that this acquisition was part of Yahoo's strategy to get a social-networking hub. Then, in November 2014, they acquired BrightRoll for $640 million (S75) and Cooliris (S76). \n\nWait, the question is about 2012-2014. So Tumblr is in 2013, which fits. BrightRoll and Cooliris are in 2014. Also, Rockmelt was acquired in August 2013 (S70). \n\nNow, how do these align with their goals? The context mentions that Tumblr was supposed to satisfy Yahoo's need for a social-networking and communications hub. For digital advertising, BrightRoll is a video advertising provider, which would help in that area. Rockmelt's acquisition might be related to enhancing their browser or ad tech, but the context doesn't explicitly state that. Cooliris might be related to media or video, but again, the context doesn't specify. \n\nI need to check the citations. The Tumblr acquisition is cited as [S65][S66][S67][S68]. The BrightRoll acquisition is [S75], and Cooliris [S76]. Rockmelt is [S70]. \n\nSo the answer should list these acquisitions with their respective citations. The alignment with goals is mentioned for Tumblr (social media) and BrightRoll (digital advertising). The other acquisitions might not have explicit mentions, so maybe just list them but note the alignment only where specified."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S107] Yahoo provided social networking services and user-generated content, including products such as My Web, Yahoo Personals, Yahoo 360\u00b0, Delicious, Flickr, and Yahoo Buzz. [S108] Yahoo closed Yahoo Buzz, MyBlogLog, and numerous other products on April 21, 2011. [S109] Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. [S110] On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360\u00b0, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a \"universal profile\" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system. [S111] ### Content\n\nYahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! [S112] Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content. [S113] Yahoo provides a personalization service, My Yahoo, which enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds and information onto a single page. [S114] On March 31, 2008, Yahoo launched Shine, a site tailored for women seeking online information and advice between the ages of 25 and 54. [S115] ### Co-branded Internet services\n\nYahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. [S116] (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC), Verizon Communications, Rogers Communications, and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers. [S117] ### Mobile services\n\nYahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. [S118] Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones. [S119] Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. [S120] The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. [S121] Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. [S122] A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results. [S123] The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories. [S124] As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch. [S125] On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger. [S126] ### Commerce\n\nYahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! [S127] Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. [S128] Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia. [S129] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004. [S130] ### Small business\n\nYahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n### Advertising\n\nYahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network. [S131] Following the closure of a \"beta\" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was re-launched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements. [S132] Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. [S133] It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. [S134] The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. [S135] Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S169] Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. [S170] Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. [S171] Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. [S172] On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section. [S173] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers. [S174] Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com. [S175] Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. [S176] Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. [S177] However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian. [S178] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did \"not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement\". [S179] Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. [S180] Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. [S181] All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service. [S182] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME). [S183] In early July 2013, Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. [S184] Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. [S185] The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz. [S186] #### Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo\n\nOn December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. [S187] The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings. [S188] The following services were in a column under \"Sunset\": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. [S189] Under the \"Merge\" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle. [S190] 11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the \"Sunset\" and \"Merge\" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad. [S191] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. [S192] For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. [S193] Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nThe blog on the *del.icio.us* website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that \"Sunset\" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. [S194] Yeh further explained that other possibilities\u2014including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)\u2014were still being considered: \"We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. [S195] Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press.\" On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of *del.icio.us* to Avos was announced. [S196] Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011, without an official announcement from Yahoo. [S197] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011. [S198] ## Privacy",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the Twitter slide leak in revealing Yahoo's strategic decisions and which services were highlighted as candidates for 'Sunset' or 'Merge'. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Passage 1 talks about various Yahoo services and their closures, but the specific mention of the Twitter slide leak is in Passage 2. \n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo\". The key sentences here are S187 to S193. Specifically, S187 mentions that on December 15, 2010, a slide from a Yahoo employee was posted on Twitter during an employee-only strategy webcast. This slide indicated changes in Yahoo's offerings. \n\nThen, under \"Sunset\" column, there are several services listed: Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog (S189). For \"Merge\", the services are Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle (S190). \n\nThe user also asks about the role of the leak. The slide leak revealed internal strategic decisions about which services would be sunsetted or merged. The leak was significant because it provided insight into Yahoo's plans, even though the company might not have officially announced them yet. \n\nI need to make sure that the citations are correctly referenced. The services under Sunset and Merge are mentioned in S189 and S190. The context about the slide being from a webcast is in S187 and S188. Also, the part about Notepad being de-emphasized is in S192 and S193, but that might not be directly relevant to the question. \n\nSo the answer should state that the Twitter slide leak exposed Yahoo's internal strategy to sunset or merge certain services. The specific services listed under Sunset and Merge are as per the citations. I need to structure the statements with the correct citations."

The broader changes include focusing on more profitable or engaging services, integrating with other platforms like Flickr, and phasing out older or less-used features. \n\nThe user's question also asks how this aligned with broader changes. The passage mentions that Yahoo was closing several services and merging others, as seen in the \"Sunset\" and \"Merge\" columns from the slide. Notepad's de-emphasis fits into this trend of consolidating services and focusing on key areas. \n\nI need to make sure the answer cites the relevant sentences. The key points are from [S191], [S192], [S193], and possibly others about the broader closures. Also, the context about Yahoo's overall strategy of shutting down underperforming services and integrating with others like Flickr would support the alignment with broader changes."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Yahoo's key international ventures and exits between 2005 and 2013, and how these reflected strategic shifts in different regions. I need to go through the provided passage and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for dates between 2005 and 2013. Let's see:\n\n- [S258] mentions joint ventures with SoftBank in Europe, Korea, and Japan. But when? The passage says \"historically,\" but maybe the specific events are in other sentences. \n\nLooking at [S259]: In November 2005, Yahoo bought SoftBank's minority interests in Europe and Korea. That's a key exit, maybe? Or a strategic move. \n\n[S261] and [S262] talk about acquiring Maktoob in 2009 for the MENA region. That's an entry into the Middle East, North Africa. \n\n[S263]-[S266] mention Yahoo Korea shutting down in 2012. That's an exit from South Korea. \n\n[S267]-[S269]: Yahoo's stake in Alibaba. They sold a 20% stake back in 2012. Also, Yahoo China shut down in 2013, redirected to Taobao. So that's an exit from China. \n\n[S260] says Yahoo launched Romania's local service in 2011, which is an entry. \n\nAlso, [S257] mentions Yahoo Japan's stake, but that's a joint venture, not an exit or entry. \n\nSo compiling these points:\n\nInternational Ventures:\n- Acquiring Maktoob in 2009 (MENA)\n- Launching Romania service in 2011\n- Joint ventures with SoftBank in Europe, Korea, Japan (but specific dates? The passage says \"historically\" but [S259] is 2005 for buying out SoftBank's stake in Europe and Korea. Maybe the initial joint ventures were earlier, but the exit of SoftBank's stake in 2005 is a strategic shift.\n\nExits:\n- Yahoo Korea shutting down in 2012\n- Yahoo China shutdown in 2013\n\nStrategic shifts: Entering new regions (Romania, MENA) while exiting others (Korea, China). Also, selling stake in Alibaba might indicate a shift in focus or financial strategy.\n\nNeed to check if there are other points. The passage also mentions Yahoo Japan's joint venture, but that's ongoing. The Alibaba stake sale in 2012 is a key exit of their investment. \n\nSo the answer should list these ventures and exits, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with citations. Also, check for any other possible entries or exits. For example, the Yahoo Japan and New Zealand ventures are mentioned in [S257], but those are joint ventures, not exits. The shutdowns in Korea and China are exits. The acquisition of Maktoob and Romania entry are ventures. The sale of Alibaba stake is an exit of their investment. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each key point as a separate statement, each with their citations. Also, ensure that the strategic shifts are explained in relation to these actions."

However, the exact evolution from 2005 isn't detailed here. The user might be expecting information on how the stake changed over time, but the context only provides specific dates. \n\nI need to check if there's more info. The other sentences talk about Yahoo's other ventures, like Yahoo Japan, but not Alibaba. So the answer should focus on the given data: initial 40% stake, selling 20% in 2012, and the shutdown in 2013. The outcome would be the sale of the stake and the shutdown of Yahoo China. \n\nI should structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences.

[S258] Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. [S259] In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea. [S260] On March 8, 2011, Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis. [S261] Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009. [S262] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region. [S263] On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, \"Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! [S264] Korea has ended.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about significant changes in Yahoo's branding and user interface between 2009 and 2013 and how these reflected the company's evolving identity. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage has several sentences numbered from S257 to S288. Let me scan through them.\n\nStarting with the logos and themes section, which is mentioned in S271. There's a mention of the first logo in 1994, but the key changes would be later. S272 talks about the original logo. Then S273 says that in May 2009, the logo was changed to purple without outline or shadow. That's a significant branding change. Also, S274 mentions this change applied to several international pages. However, S275 notes that some countries like Yahoo!7 in Australia kept the red logo until 2014. So the 2009 change is a key point.\n\nThen there's the new logo announcement in August 2013 (S276-279). The \"30 Days of Change\" campaign and the new logo launch in September 2013. The new logo was described as whimsical, sophisticated, modern, etc., as per Mayer's explanation. This shows a shift in branding towards a more modern and fresh image.\n\nRegarding user interface changes, S286 mentions the new \"My Yahoo\" homepage launched in September 2013. The redesign allows personalized widgets and theme packs. This indicates a move towards a more customizable and user-centric interface.\n\nAlso, the context mentions the rebranding in the MENA region with Maktoob (S261, S262) and the shutdown of Yahoo Korea (S263-S266), but those might be more about market presence than branding or UI. The Alibaba stake changes (S267-S269, S270) are business changes, not directly UI or branding.\n\nSo the main points are the 2009 logo change to purple, the 2013 new logo with the \"30 Days of Change\" campaign, and the My Yahoo redesign in 2013. These changes reflect an evolving identity towards modernity, personalization, and a fresh image. The citations would be S273, S274, S276-S279, S286, S287, S288. Also, S275 about the Australia logo change. Need to check if all these are within 2009-2013. The 2013 logo was unveiled in September 2013, so that's within the timeframe. The My Yahoo redesign is also 2013.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each significant change as a statement, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is concise and the citations are correctly placed."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S199] In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. [S200] Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States. [S201] In October 2013, *The Washington Post* reported that the U.S. [S202] National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular. [S203] In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a \"coordinated effort\" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. [S204] The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation. [S205] ### Storing personal information and tracking usage\n\nWorking with comScore, *The New York Times* found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. [S206] By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. [S207] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. [S208] However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits. [S209] On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a \"Do Not Track\" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements. [S210] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the \"Do Not Track\" browser setting. [S211] According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events. [S212] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes. [S213] In September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014. [S214] In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! [S215] created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI. [S216] ## Criticism\n\nIn 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party. [S217] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine. [S218] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009. [S219] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware. [S220] Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. [S221] In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for \"providing state secrets to foreign entities\" as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo. [S222] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate. [S223] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. [S224] In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. [S225] Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. [S226] Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, D.C., and other purchases. [S227] In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of \"incitement to subvert state power\" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. [S228] Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address. [S229] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S77] By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013. [S78] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling internet business, and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site. [S79] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. [S80] Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told *The Washington Post* that sometimes, \"the single best thing you can do ... [S81] is sell the company.\" The closing price of Yahoo! [S82] Inc. [S83] on December 7, 2015, was $34.68. [S84] *The Wall Street Journal*'s Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016, that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce. [S85] On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core internet business for $4.83 billion. [S86] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella. [S87] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! [S88] Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team. [S89] On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts, one of the largest breaches reported to date. [S90] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack. [S91] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts. [S92] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to \"forge\" cookies. [S93] In response to these breaches, *Bloomberg News* reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million, causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices. [S94] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! [S95] by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches. [S96] On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. [S97] The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017. [S98] ### Chief Executive Officers\n\nEight chief executives and interim leaders have led the Yahoo company from 1995 until 2017. [S99] They are:\n\n* Marissa Mayer (2012\u20132017)\n* Ross Levinsohn Interim (2012)\n* Scott Thompson (2012)\n* Tim Morse Interim (2011\u20132012)\n* Carol Bartz (2009\u20132011)\n* Jerry Yang (2007\u20132009)\n* Terry Semel (2001\u20132007)\n* Timothy Koogle (1995\u20132001)\n\nFor the CEOs of the \"new\" Yahoo, see Yahoo! [S100] Inc. [S101] (2017\u2013present)#Chief Executive Officers. [S102] ## Products and services\n\nYahoo operated a portal that provides the latest news, entertainment, and sports information. [S103] The portal also gave users access to other Yahoo services like Yahoo! [S104] Search, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Maps, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Messenger. [S105] ### Communication\n\nYahoo provided Internet communication services such as Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo Mail. [S106] As of May 2007, its e-mail service would offer unlimited storage.",

        "[S199] In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. [S200] Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States. [S201] In October 2013, *The Washington Post* reported that the U.S. [S202] National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular. [S203] In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a \"coordinated effort\" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. [S204] The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation. [S205] ### Storing personal information and tracking usage\n\nWorking with comScore, *The New York Times* found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. [S206] By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. [S207] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. [S208] However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits. [S209] On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a \"Do Not Track\" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements. [S210] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the \"Do Not Track\" browser setting. [S211] According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events. [S212] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes. [S213] In September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014. [S214] In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! [S215] created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI. [S216] ## Criticism\n\nIn 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party. [S217] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine. [S218] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009. [S219] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware. [S220] Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. [S221] In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for \"providing state secrets to foreign entities\" as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo. [S222] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate. [S223] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. [S224] In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. [S225] Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. [S226] Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, D.C., and other purchases. [S227] In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of \"incitement to subvert state power\" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. [S228] Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address. [S229] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.",
        "[S77] By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013. [S78] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling internet business, and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site. [S79] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. [S80] Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told *The Washington Post* that sometimes, \"the single best thing you can do ... [S81] is sell the company.\" The closing price of Yahoo! [S82] Inc. [S83] on December 7, 2015, was $34.68. [S84] *The Wall Street Journal*'s Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016, that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce. [S85] On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core internet business for $4.83 billion. [S86] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella. [S87] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! [S88] Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team. [S89] On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts, one of the largest breaches reported to date. [S90] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack. [S91] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts. [S92] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to \"forge\" cookies. [S93] In response to these breaches, *Bloomberg News* reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million, causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices. [S94] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! [S95] by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches. [S96] On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. [S97] The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the implications of Yahoo's data collection capabilities and privacy policies and how they compared to other organizations. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passages for mentions of Yahoo's data collection. In Passage 1, there's a section titled \"Storing personal information and tracking usage.\" It mentions that Yahoo worked with comScore and collected more data than competitors. Specifically, it says Yahoo could build a profile of 2,500 records per month per visitor in 2007. Also, they retained search requests for 13 months but obfuscated IP addresses after three months. They had a 2-petabyte data warehouse, which is much larger than the IRS's 150 terabytes. There's also mention of the Do Not Track feature being introduced and then dropped. The 2014 data breach affecting 500 million accounts and the 2015 software to search emails at NSA/FBI request are significant.\n\nComparing to other organizations, the IRS database is much smaller, and the data warehouse size is a key point. Also, the 2014 breach was one of the largest. The privacy policies included some measures like obfuscating IPs but also issues like the Do Not Track reversal. The criticism about cooperating with Chinese censorship and aiding arrests of dissidents adds to the implications.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's more on the data breaches in 2014 and the subsequent legal issues, which show the implications of their data handling. The sale to Verizon and the financial impacts due to breaches also reflect on their policies.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its citations. For example, the data collection comparison to competitors would cite [S206] and [S207]. The data warehouse size compared to IRS is [S212] and [S213]. The breaches and their scale are [S214] and [S215]. The Do Not Track policy changes are [S210] and [S211]. The cooperation with governments and criticism are [S221], [S222], etc.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is concise and the citations are correctly placed. Also, check if all relevant points are covered and that comparisons to other organizations are clear."

[S137] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. [S138] The service was launched in September 2008. [S139] In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft. [S140] But by 2013, this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share. [S141] On September 27, 2023, Yahoo partnered with Good-Loop to offer carbon neutral private marketplace (PMP) media opportunities to help advertisers be more sustainable.

The user is asking about Yahoo's stock performance during the dot-com bubble and its decline, how that reflects broader business strategy challenges, and the market cap in 2011.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. There are two passages. Let me check Passage 2 first because it mentions the dot-com bubble and stock prices. \n\nIn Passage 2, S43-45 talk about Yahoo's IPO in 1996, stock price soaring during the dot-com bubble, reaching a high of $118.75 in 2000. Then after the bubble burst, it dropped to $8.11 in 2001. That's the stock performance part. The question also asks how this reflects broader challenges in business strategy. The context mentions that after the bubble, Yahoo struggled, had layoffs, and faced challenges like developing their own search tech after using Google's. Also, the Microsoft bid in 2008 and subsequent issues. \n\nFor the market cap in 2011, looking at S53 in Passage 2, it says that three years after the 2008 events (so around 2011), Yahoo's market cap was $22.24 billion. \n\nNow, I need to structure the answer. The first part is about the stock performance during the bubble and decline. The citations here would be S43, S44, S45, S46. Then, the broader challenges: maybe S47 (using Google's search), S48 (developing their own tech), S49 (email storage), S50 (struggles in 2008), S51 (Microsoft bid), S52 (rejection of bid). But the user wants how the stock performance reflects business strategy challenges. So maybe the decline after the bubble is linked to their strategies, like reliance on Google, failed partnerships, etc. \n\nThe market cap in 2011 is S53. \n\nI need to make sure each statement has the correct citations. Let me check again. The stock price peak during the bubble is S44, the post-bubble low S45, and S46. Then the market cap in 2011 is S53. The challenges might be mentioned in S47-S52, but I need to see if those directly relate. The user might want the answer to connect the stock decline to strategic issues. For example, after the bubble, Yahoo's struggles like layoffs, failed strategies (like the partnership with Microsoft in 2011, which underperformed as per S139 and S140 in Passage 1). Wait, but S139 and S140 are in Passage 1. However, the user's question is about the broader challenges in business strategy. \n\nBut the supporting context provided includes both passages. So maybe the answer should use both. However, the user's question is about Yahoo's stock performance during the dot-com bubble and subsequent decline, which is covered in Passage 2. The market cap in 2011 is in Passage 2. \n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nYahoo's stock price soared during the dot-com bubble, reaching a high of $118.75 in 2000 (S44), but fell to a low of $8.11 after the bubble burst (S45). This decline reflected challenges in its business strategy, such as reliance on Google for search (S47) and struggles with internal development (S48). In 2011, Yahoo's market capitalization was $22.24 billion (S53).\n\nBut I need to make sure each statement has the correct citations. Also, the user might want more specific connections between the stock performance and strategy. For example, the post-bubble low (S45) and the subsequent challenges. Maybe the answer should mention the post-bubble low and then the strategies that followed. \n\nAnother point: the Microsoft bid in 2008 (S50) and the rejection (S51) might be part of the challenges. Also, the layoffs in 2008 (S49). \n\nBut the user's question is about how the stock performance during the bubble and decline reflects broader challenges. So the answer should link the stock's rise and fall to strategic moves. For example, during the bubble, the stock soared, but after the bubble, the company faced challenges like not keeping up with competitors, reliance on others, etc. \n\nSo the answer would be structured with two sentences: one about the stock performance and citations, another about the challenges with citations, and then the market cap. But the user's question is a single question, so maybe combine it into one statement. \n\nWait, the user's question is: \"How did Yahoo's stock performance during the dot-com bubble and subsequent decline reflect broader challenges in its business strategy, and what was its market capitalization in 2011?\"\n\nSo the answer needs to address both parts. So the first part is explaining the reflection of challenges, and the second part is the market cap. \n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nYahoo's stock performance during the dot-com bubble, peaking at $118.75 in 2000 (S44), and subsequent decline to $8.11 in 2001 (S45) reflected challenges in its business strategy, such as reliance on Google for search (S47) and struggles with internal development (S48). In 2011, Yahoo's market capitalization was $22.24 billion (S53).\n\nBut I need to check if the citations are correctly placed. Also, the user might want more specific citations for the challenges. For example, the post-bubble low (S45) and then the strategies like developing their own search tech (S48). \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be split into two statements. But the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. So maybe:\n\n<statement>Yahoo's stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000.<cite>[S44]</cite></statement>\n<statement>After the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001.<cite>[S45]</cite></statement>\n<statement>This decline reflected broader challenges in its business strategy, such as reliance on Google for search and struggles with internal development.<cite>[S47][S48]</cite></statement>\n<statement>In 2011, Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion.<cite>[S53]</cite></statement>\n\nBut the user's question is a single question, so maybe combine the first two statements into one. However, the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. So the answer should be structured with each relevant sentence. \n\nI think that's the way to go. So the final answer would have four statements as above. But I need to make sure that each sentence is accurate and the citations are correct."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how Yahoo's international operations and partnerships evolved from 2005 to 2012, and the key milestones. I need to go through the provided passage and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the passage for dates between 2005 and 2012. Let's see:\n\n- [S258] mentions joint ventures with SoftBank in Europe, Korea, and Japan. But when exactly? The passage doesn't specify the exact year here, just says \"historically,\" so maybe this is before 2005? Not sure yet.\n\n- [S259] says in November 2005, Yahoo bought SoftBank's minority interests in Europe and Korea. That's a key milestone in 2005. So that's one point.\n\n- [S261] and [S262] talk about acquiring Maktoob in August 2009, entering the MENA region. That's another milestone in 2009.\n\n- [S263]-[S266] mention Yahoo Korea shutting down in 2012. So that's a significant event in 2012.\n\n- [S267]-[S269] discuss the Alibaba stake. Yahoo had a 40% stake, then sold 20% back in 2012. So that's a partnership evolution. The shutdown of Yahoo China in 2013 is after 2012, so maybe not included.\n\n- [S260] is about launching Romania's service in 2011. That's another milestone.\n\nAlso, [S257] mentions Yahoo Japan's stake, but that's more about ownership structure, not evolution over time. Maybe not directly relevant unless there's a change. But the passage doesn't mention changes here, just current stakes.\n\nSo compiling these points:\n\n2005: Bought SoftBank's interests in Europe and Korea (S259).\n\n2009: Acquired Maktoob, entered MENA (S261, S262).\n\n2011: Launched Romania service (S260).\n\n2012: Yahoo Korea shutdown (S263-266), and selling 20% stake in Alibaba (S269).\n\nAlso, the Alibaba stake evolution: initial 40% (S267), then selling 20% in 2012 (S269). But the user is asking about international operations and partnerships. Alibaba is in China, so that's an international partnership. The shutdown of Yahoo Korea is an exit from a market.\n\nAre there other points? The passage also mentions Yahoo Japan's stake with SoftBank and others, but that's more about ownership structure rather than evolution over the period. Unless there's a change, but the passage doesn't mention any changes in those stakes during 2005-2012. The 2012 shutdown of Yahoo Korea is a key exit.\n\nSo the key milestones would be:\n\n- 2005: Acquisition of SoftBank's stakes in Europe and Korea.\n\n- 2009: Acquisition of Maktoob, entering MENA.\n\n- 2011: Romania service launch.\n\n- 2012: Yahoo Korea shutdown and Alibaba stake sale.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, the Yahoo Japan and other regional partnerships in [S257] might be part of their international operations, but since the question is about evolution, unless there's a change, maybe not. The passage doesn't mention changes in those partnerships during the period, just their existence.\n\nSo the answer should list these milestones with their citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the appropriate citations. Let me make sure each statement is correctly cited."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Yahoo! [S2] Inc. [S3] (1995\u20132017)\n\n\n# Yahoo! [S4] Inc. [S5] (1995\u20132017)\n\n\n\n**Yahoo! [S6] Inc.** was an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. [S7] Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. [S8] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early internet era in the 1990s. [S9] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, was CEO and president of Yahoo from July 2012 until June 2017. [S10] It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! [S11] Search, and related services, including Yahoo! [S12] Directory, Yahoo! [S13] Mail, Yahoo! [S14] News, Yahoo! [S15] Finance, Yahoo! [S16] Groups, Yahoo! [S17] Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. [S18] At its height, it was one of the most popular sites in the United States. [S19] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! [S20] was the highest-read news and media website, with over seven billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016 According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month. [S21] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted \"more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages\". [S22] Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s, and on February 21, 2017, Verizon Communications announced its intent to acquire old Yahoo's internet business (excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! [S23] Japan) for $4.48 billion\u2014the company was once valued at over $100 billion. [S24] Before the transaction was completed, the company expected to change its name to **Altaba Inc.** Verizon completed its acquisition of the old iteration of Yahoo! [S25] Inc's internet business on June 13, 2017. [S26] Verizon announced that the old Yahoo! [S27] Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath, which later became known as Verizon Media in 2019 and eventually renamed to the current iteration of Yahoo! [S28] Inc. [S29] in 2021. [S30] ## History\n\n\n### Founding\n\nIn January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named \"Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web\". [S31] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. [S32] In March 1994, \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\" was renamed \"Yahoo!\", the human-edited Yahoo! [S33] Directory, provided for users to surf through the internet, being their first product and original purpose. [S34] The \"yahoo.com\" domain was created on January 18, 1995. [S35] The word \"yahoo\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\" or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\". [S36] The term \"hierarchical\" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. [S37] The term \"oracle\" was intended to mean \"source of truth and wisdom\", and the term \"officious\", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. [S38] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a \"yahoo\" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\" This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from *Gulliver's Travels*. [S39] ### Expansion\n\nYahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. [S40] Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. [S41] By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine. [S42] It also made many high-profile acquisitions.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S230] As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's \"user created\" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. [S231] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active. [S232] Yahoo was\u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S233] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group, which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. [S234] The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. [S235] On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website \"Cryptome\" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers. [S236] After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised, Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident. [S237] ### Allegations of sexism against men\n\nScott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. [S238] Ard, a male employee, stated \"Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees\". [S239] In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received \"fully satisfactory\" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News. [S240] The lawsuit states:\n\"Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. [S241] (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. [S242] Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext.\"\n\nA second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.

        "[S1] Yahoo! [S2] Inc. [S3] (1995\u20132017)\n\n\n# Yahoo! [S4] Inc. [S5] (1995\u20132017)\n\n\n\n**Yahoo! [S6] Inc.** was an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. [S7] Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. [S8] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early internet era in the 1990s. [S9] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, was CEO and president of Yahoo from July 2012 until June 2017. [S10] It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! [S11] Search, and related services, including Yahoo! [S12] Directory, Yahoo! [S13] Mail, Yahoo! [S14] News, Yahoo! [S15] Finance, Yahoo! [S16] Groups, Yahoo! [S17] Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. [S18] At its height, it was one of the most popular sites in the United States. [S19] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! [S20] was the highest-read news and media website, with over seven billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016 According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month. [S21] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted \"more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages\". [S22] Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s, and on February 21, 2017, Verizon Communications announced its intent to acquire old Yahoo's internet business (excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! [S23] Japan) for $4.48 billion\u2014the company was once valued at over $100 billion. [S24] Before the transaction was completed, the company expected to change its name to **Altaba Inc.** Verizon completed its acquisition of the old iteration of Yahoo! [S25] Inc's internet business on June 13, 2017. [S26] Verizon announced that the old Yahoo! [S27] Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath, which later became known as Verizon Media in 2019 and eventually renamed to the current iteration of Yahoo! [S28] Inc. [S29] in 2021. [S30] ## History\n\n\n### Founding\n\nIn January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named \"Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web\". [S31] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. [S32] In March 1994, \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\" was renamed \"Yahoo!\", the human-edited Yahoo! [S33] Directory, provided for users to surf through the internet, being their first product and original purpose. [S34] The \"yahoo.com\" domain was created on January 18, 1995. [S35] The word \"yahoo\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\" or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\". [S36] The term \"hierarchical\" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. [S37] The term \"oracle\" was intended to mean \"source of truth and wisdom\", and the term \"officious\", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. [S38] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a \"yahoo\" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\" This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from *Gulliver's Travels*. [S39] ### Expansion\n\nYahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. [S40] Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. [S41] By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine. [S42] It also made many high-profile acquisitions.",
        "[S230] As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's \"user created\" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. [S231] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active. [S232] Yahoo was\u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S233] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group, which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. [S234] The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. [S235] On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website \"Cryptome\" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers. [S236] After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised, Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident. [S237] ### Allegations of sexism against men\n\nScott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. [S238] Ard, a male employee, stated \"Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees\". [S239] In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received \"fully satisfactory\" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News. [S240] The lawsuit states:\n\"Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. [S241] (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. [S242] Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext.\"\n\nA second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the legal challenges Marissa Mayer faced during her time as CEO of Yahoo! and the specific gender discrimination allegations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions two lawsuits. The first one is from Scott Ard, a male employee who was fired in 2015. He sued, claiming Mayer led a sexist campaign to remove male employees. The passage states that Ard alleged the performance-rating system was used to favor management's biases against men. There's a citation here: [S238], [S239], [S240], [S241], [S242]. \n\nAnother lawsuit is mentioned involving Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014. He filed a case in 2016, saying the performance management system was arbitrary and unfair. This is cited in [S243]. \n\nI need to make sure these are the only instances. The rest of the context talks about Yahoo's history, other issues like the chatrooms and shark products, but not directly about Mayer's legal challenges. The Board of Directors and CEO sections don't mention other lawsuits. \n\nSo the answer should mention both lawsuits, the specific claims about the performance system being biased against men, and cite the relevant sentences. Each sentence in the answer should have the correct citations. Let me structure the statements accordingly."

In Passage 1, there's a lot of history and background about Yahoo, but not much on controversies. The second passage, however, has some specific points. Let me check each sentence in Passage 2.\n\nLooking at [S230], it mentions that Yahoo closed down user-created chatrooms in 2005 due to media scrutiny about internet child predators and low ad revenues. That's a controversy related to their services. Then [S231] talks about image search issues in 2006 where explicit content appeared even with SafeSearch on. That's another service-related problem.\n\nNext, [S232] mentions Yahoo's ownership of Alibaba and the controversy over shark products. They banned shark fins in 2009. That's a policy issue. Then [S235] and [S236] discuss the DMCA notice to Cryptome, which is about censorship concerns. The [S237] part mentions an apology for accidentally censoring Occupy Wall Street related emails.\n\nThen there's the section on sexism allegations. [S238] to [S242] detail Scott Ard's lawsuit against Marissa Mayer for a sexist campaign against male employees. Another lawsuit from Gregory Anderson in [S243] about the performance management system. These are policy-related controversies.\n\nNow, I need to structure these points into statements with proper citations. Each controversy should be a separate statement, citing the relevant sentences. Also, I need to ensure that the impact on public perception is addressed. For example, closing chatrooms might have affected user trust, the image search issue could have damaged their reputation for safety, the DMCA notice might have raised privacy concerns, and the sexism lawsuits would impact their public image regarding workplace policies.\n\nI should make sure each statement is concise and directly answers the question. Let me list each controversy with its citation and then note the impact. Need to check if all citations are correctly numbered and that each statement is properly formatted."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S107] Yahoo provided social networking services and user-generated content, including products such as My Web, Yahoo Personals, Yahoo 360\u00b0, Delicious, Flickr, and Yahoo Buzz. [S108] Yahoo closed Yahoo Buzz, MyBlogLog, and numerous other products on April 21, 2011. [S109] Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. [S110] On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360\u00b0, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a \"universal profile\" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system. [S111] ### Content\n\nYahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! [S112] Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content. [S113] Yahoo provides a personalization service, My Yahoo, which enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds and information onto a single page. [S114] On March 31, 2008, Yahoo launched Shine, a site tailored for women seeking online information and advice between the ages of 25 and 54.

[S116] (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC), Verizon Communications, Rogers Communications, and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers. [S117] ### Mobile services\n\nYahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. [S118] Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones. [S119] Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. [S120] The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. [S121] Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. [S122] A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results. [S123] The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories. [S124] As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch. [S125] On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger.

[S131] Following the closure of a \"beta\" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was re-launched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements. [S132] Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. [S133] It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. [S134] The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. [S135] Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S169] Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. [S170] Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. [S171] Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. [S172] On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section. [S173] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers. [S174] Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com. [S175] Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. [S176] Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. [S177] However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian. [S178] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did \"not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement\". [S179] Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. [S180] Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. [S181] All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service. [S182] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME). [S183] In early July 2013, Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. [S184] Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. [S185] The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz. [S186] #### Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo\n\nOn December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. [S187] The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings. [S188] The following services were in a column under \"Sunset\": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. [S189] Under the \"Merge\" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle. [S190] 11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the \"Sunset\" and \"Merge\" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad. [S191] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. [S192] For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. [S193] Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nThe blog on the *del.icio.us* website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that \"Sunset\" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. [S194] Yeh further explained that other possibilities\u2014including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)\u2014were still being considered: \"We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. [S195] Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press.\" On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of *del.icio.us* to Avos was announced. [S196] Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011, without an official announcement from Yahoo. [S197] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011. [S198] ## Privacy",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how Yahoo's strategy for mobile services evolved between 2007 and 2010, and the specific features introduced to enhance user experience.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has several sections, and I need to focus on the \"Mobile services\" part. Let me check that section again.\n\nIn Passage 1, under \"Mobile services,\" there's a mention of Yahoo Mobile offering services like email, instant messaging, mobile blogging, information services, searches, and alerts. Then, it says Yahoo introduced OneSearch for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. The details about OneSearch include results like news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather, and links. It also mentions that OneSearch provides local theater info for movies, requiring a zip code or city. Additionally, there's a note that as of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's service for OneSearch. Then, on October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile via Yahoo Messenger.\n\nSo, between 2007 and 2010, the key points are the introduction of OneSearch in 2007, which enhanced mobile search with local results and integration with Flickr, and the 2010 plan for video chat via Messenger. Also, the mobile services included email, IM, blogging, etc. Are there other features? The context also mentions services for camera phones like entertainment and ringtones, but that's part of the general mobile services description.\n\nI need to structure the answer with the evolution: starting with the launch of OneSearch in 2007, then the 2010 video chat addition. The specific features would be OneSearch's local search capabilities, integration with Flickr, and the upcoming video chat. Also, the existing services like email, IM, etc., but the question is about evolution, so focusing on changes over time.\n\nCheck if there are other citations. The OneSearch details are in [S118] to [S124], and the video chat in [S126]. The general mobile services description is in [S118] and [S119]. So the answer should cite those.\n\nNow, make sure there's no info outside the given context. The user's question is about 2007-2010, so the 2012 note about Novarra might be out of scope. The 2010 video chat is within the timeframe.\n\nSo the answer would state that Yahoo evolved by introducing OneSearch in 2007 with local search and Flickr integration, and in 2010 added video chat via Messenger. The specific features are OneSearch's local results, Flickr images, and video chat. Citations would be [S118]-[S124] for OneSearch and [S126] for video chat. Also, the general mobile services in [S118] and [S119]."

    "[S1] Yahoo! [S2] Inc. [S3] (1995\u20132017)\n\n\n# Yahoo! [S4] Inc. [S5] (1995\u20132017)\n\n\n\n**Yahoo! [S6] Inc.** was an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. [S7] Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. [S8] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early internet era in the 1990s. [S9] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, was CEO and president of Yahoo from July 2012 until June 2017. [S10] It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! [S11] Search, and related services, including Yahoo! [S12] Directory, Yahoo! [S13] Mail, Yahoo! [S14] News, Yahoo! [S15] Finance, Yahoo! [S16] Groups, Yahoo! [S17] Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. [S18] At its height, it was one of the most popular sites in the United States. [S19] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! [S20] was the highest-read news and media website, with over seven billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016 According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month. [S21] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted \"more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages\". [S22] Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s, and on February 21, 2017, Verizon Communications announced its intent to acquire old Yahoo's internet business (excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! [S23] Japan) for $4.48 billion\u2014the company was once valued at over $100 billion. [S24] Before the transaction was completed, the company expected to change its name to **Altaba Inc.** Verizon completed its acquisition of the old iteration of Yahoo! [S25] Inc's internet business on June 13, 2017. [S26] Verizon announced that the old Yahoo! [S27] Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath, which later became known as Verizon Media in 2019 and eventually renamed to the current iteration of Yahoo! [S28] Inc. [S29] in 2021. [S30] ## History\n\n\n### Founding\n\nIn January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named \"Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web\". [S31] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. [S32] In March 1994, \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\" was renamed \"Yahoo!\", the human-edited Yahoo! [S33] Directory, provided for users to surf through the internet, being their first product and original purpose. [S34] The \"yahoo.com\" domain was created on January 18, 1995. [S35] The word \"yahoo\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\" or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\". [S36] The term \"hierarchical\" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. [S37] The term \"oracle\" was intended to mean \"source of truth and wisdom\", and the term \"officious\", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. [S38] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a \"yahoo\" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\" This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from *Gulliver's Travels*. [S39] ### Expansion\n\nYahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. [S40] Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. [S41] By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine. [S42] It also made many high-profile acquisitions.",
    "[S43] Yahoo!'s initial public offering at the NASDAQ was on April 12, 1996, closing at US$33.00\u2014up 270 percent from the IPO price\u2014after peaking at $43.00 for the day. [S44] Its stock price skyrocketed during the dot-com bubble, closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000. [S45] However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low of $8.11 on September 26, 2001. [S46] Yahoo began using Google for search in 2000. [S47] Over the next four years, it developed its own search technologies, which it began using in 2004. [S48] In response to Google's Gmail, Yahoo began to offer unlimited email storage in 2007. [S49] The company struggled through 2008, with several large layoffs. [S50] In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited bid to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion. [S51] Yahoo formally rejected the bid, claiming that it \"substantially undervalues\" the company and was not in the interest of its shareholders. [S52] Three years later, Yahoo had a market capitalization of $22.24 billion. [S53] Carol Bartz replaced Yang as CEO in January 2009. [S54] In September 2011, she was removed from her position at Yahoo by the company's chairman Roy Bostock, and CFO Tim Morse was named as Interim CEO of the company. [S55] In early 2012, after the appointment of Scott Thompson as CEO, rumors began to spread about looming layoffs. [S56] Several key executives, such as Chief Product Officer Blake Irving, left. [S57] On April 4, 2012, Yahoo announced a cut of 2,000 jobs or about 14 percent of its 14,100 workers. [S58] The cut was expected to save around $375 million annually after the layoffs were completed at end of 2012. [S59] In an email sent to employees in April 2012, Thompson reiterated his view that customers should come first at Yahoo. [S60] He also completely reorganized the company. [S61] On May 13, 2012, Yahoo issued a press release stating that Thompson was no longer with the company, and would immediately be replaced on an interim basis by Ross Levinsohn, recently appointed head of Yahoo's new Media group. [S62] Thompson's total compensation for his 130-day tenure with Yahoo was at least $7.3 million. [S63] On July 16, 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed president and CEO of Yahoo, effective the following day. [S64] On May 19, 2013, the Yahoo board approved a $1.1 billion purchase of blogging site Tumblr. [S65] Tumblr's CEO and founder David Karp would remain a large shareholder. [S66] The announcement reportedly signified a changing trend in the technology industry, as large corporations like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google acquired start-up Internet companies that generated low amounts of revenue as a way in which to connect with sizeable, fast-growing online communities. [S67] The *Wall Street Journal* stated that the purchase of Tumblr would satisfy Yahoo's need for \"a thriving social-networking and communications hub.\" On May 20, the company announced the acquisition of Tumblr officially. [S68] The company also announced plans to open a San Francisco office in July 2013. [S69] On August 2, 2013, Yahoo acquired Rockmelt; its staff was retained, but all of its existing products were terminated. [S70] Data collated by comScore during July 2013, revealed that more people in the U.S. [S71] visited Yahoo websites during the month in comparison to Google; the occasion was the first time that Yahoo outperformed Google since 2011. [S72] The data did not count mobile usage, nor Tumblr. [S73] In November 2014, Yahoo! [S74] announced that it would acquire the video advertising provider BrightRoll for $640 million. [S75] On November 21, 2014, it was announced that Yahoo had acquired Cooliris. [S76] ### Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase",
    "[S77] By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013. [S78] It did go up to $36.04 in the mid afternoon of December 2, 2015, perhaps on news that the board of directors was meeting to decide on the future of Mayer, whether to sell the struggling internet business, and whether to continue with the spinoff of its stake in China's Alibaba e-commerce site. [S79] Not all had gone well during Mayer's tenure, including the $1.1 billion acquisition of Tumblr that had yet to prove beneficial and the forays into original video content that led to a $42 million write-down. [S80] Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, told *The Washington Post* that sometimes, \"the single best thing you can do ... [S81] is sell the company.\" The closing price of Yahoo! [S82] Inc. [S83] on December 7, 2015, was $34.68. [S84] *The Wall Street Journal*'s Douglas MacMillan reported on February 2, 2016, that Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer was expected to cut 15% of its workforce. [S85] On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications announced that it had agreed to purchase Yahoo's core internet business for $4.83 billion. [S86] Following the conclusion of the purchase, these assets will be merged with AOL to form a new entity known as Oath; Yahoo, AOL, and Huffington Post will continue to operate under their own names, under the Oath umbrella. [S87] The deal excludes Yahoo's 15% stake in Alibaba Group and 35.5% stake in Yahoo! [S88] Japan; following the completion of the acquisition, these assets will be retained under the name Altaba, with a new executive team. [S89] On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed a data breach that occurred in late 2014, in which information associated with at least 500 million user accounts, one of the largest breaches reported to date. [S90] The United States have indicted four men, including two employees of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), for their involvement in the hack. [S91] On December 14, 2016, the company revealed that another separate data breach had occurred in 2014, with hackers obtaining sensitive account information, including security questions, to at least one billion accounts. [S92] The company stated that hackers had utilized stolen internal software to \"forge\" cookies. [S93] In response to these breaches, *Bloomberg News* reported that Verizon was attempting to re-negotiate the deal to reduce the purchase price by $250 million, causing a 2% increase in Yahoo stock prices. [S94] On February 21, 2017, Verizon agreed to lower its purchase price for Yahoo! [S95] by $350 million, and share liabilities regarding the investigation into the data breaches. [S96] On June 8, 2017, Yahoo shareholders approved the company's sale of some of its Internet assets to Verizon for $4.48 billion. [S97] The deal officially closed on June 13, 2017. [S98] ### Chief Executive Officers\n\nEight chief executives and interim leaders have led the Yahoo company from 1995 until 2017. [S99] They are:\n\n* Marissa Mayer (2012\u20132017)\n* Ross Levinsohn Interim (2012)\n* Scott Thompson (2012)\n* Tim Morse Interim (2011\u20132012)\n* Carol Bartz (2009\u20132011)\n* Jerry Yang (2007\u20132009)\n* Terry Semel (2001\u20132007)\n* Timothy Koogle (1995\u20132001)\n\nFor the CEOs of the \"new\" Yahoo, see Yahoo! [S100] Inc. [S101] (2017\u2013present)#Chief Executive Officers. [S102] ## Products and services\n\nYahoo operated a portal that provides the latest news, entertainment, and sports information. [S103] The portal also gave users access to other Yahoo services like Yahoo! [S104] Search, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Maps, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Messenger. [S105] ### Communication\n\nYahoo provided Internet communication services such as Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo Mail. [S106] As of May 2007, its e-mail service would offer unlimited storage.",
    "[S107] Yahoo provided social networking services and user-generated content, including products such as My Web, Yahoo Personals, Yahoo 360\u00b0, Delicious, Flickr, and Yahoo Buzz. [S108] Yahoo closed Yahoo Buzz, MyBlogLog, and numerous other products on April 21, 2011. [S109] Yahoo Photos was closed on September 20, 2007, in favor of Flickr. [S110] On October 16, 2007, Yahoo announced that it would discontinue Yahoo 360\u00b0, including bug repairs; the company explained that in 2008 it would instead establish a \"universal profile\" similar to the Yahoo Mash experimental system. [S111] ### Content\n\nYahoo partners with numerous content providers in products such as Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Music, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo! [S112] Answers and Yahoo Games to provide news and related content. [S113] Yahoo provides a personalization service, My Yahoo, which enables users to combine their favorite Yahoo features, content feeds and information onto a single page. [S114] On March 31, 2008, Yahoo launched Shine, a site tailored for women seeking online information and advice between the ages of 25 and 54. [S115] ### Co-branded Internet services\n\nYahoo developed partnerships with broadband providers such as AT&T Inc. [S116] (via Prodigy, BellSouth & SBC), Verizon Communications, Rogers Communications, and British Telecom, offering a range of free and premium Yahoo content and services to subscribers. [S117] ### Mobile services\n\nYahoo Mobile offers services for email, instant messaging, and mobile blogging, as well as information services, searches and alerts. [S118] Services for the camera phone include entertainment and ring tones. [S119] Yahoo introduced its Internet search system, called OneSearch, for mobile phones on March 20, 2007. [S120] The results include news headlines, images from Flickr, business listings, local weather and links to other sites. [S121] Instead of showing only, for example, popular movies or some critical reviews, OneSearch lists local theaters that at the moment are playing the movie, along with user ratings and news headlines regarding the movie. [S122] A zip code or city name is required for OneSearch to start delivering local search results. [S123] The results of a Web search are listed on a single page and are prioritized into categories. [S124] As of 2012, Yahoo used Novarra's mobile content transcoding service for OneSearch. [S125] On October 8, 2010, Yahoo announced plans to bring video chat to mobile phones via Yahoo Messenger. [S126] ### Commerce\n\nYahoo offers shopping services such as Yahoo! [S127] Shopping, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Real Estate and Yahoo Travel, which enables users to gather relevant information and make commercial transactions and purchases online. [S128] Yahoo Auctions were discontinued in 2007 except for Asia. [S129] Yahoo Shopping is a price comparison service which uses the Kelkoo price comparison service it acquired in April 2004. [S130] ### Small business\n\nYahoo provides business services such as Yahoo DomainKeys, Yahoo Web Hosting, Yahoo Merchant Solutions, Yahoo Business Email and Yahoo Store to small business owners and professionals allowing them to build their own online stores using Yahoo's tools.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n### Advertising\n\nYahoo Search Marketing provides services such as Sponsored Search, Local Advertising and Product/Travel/Directory Submit that let different businesses advertise their products and services on the Yahoo network. [S131] Following the closure of a \"beta\" version on April 30, 2010, the Yahoo Publisher Network was re-launched as an advertising tool that allows online publishers to monetize their websites through the use of site-relevant advertisements. [S132] Yahoo launched its new Internet advertisement sales system on February 5, 2007, called Panama. [S133] It allows advertisers to bid for search terms to trigger their ads on search results pages. [S134] The system considers bids, ad quality, clickthrough rates and other factors in ranking ads. [S135] Through Panama, Yahoo aims to provide more relevant search results to users, a better overall experience, and to increase monetization.",
    "[S136] On April 7, 2008, Yahoo announced APT from Yahoo, which was originally called AMP from Yahoo, an online advertising management platform. [S137] The platform simplifies advertising sales by unifying buyer and seller markets. [S138] The service was launched in September 2008. [S139] In September 2011, Yahoo formed an ad selling strategic partnership with 2 of its top competitors, AOL and Microsoft. [S140] But by 2013, this was found to be underperforming in market share and revenue, as Microsoft simply skimmed off four percent of the search market from Yahoo, without growing their combined share. [S141] On September 27, 2023, Yahoo partnered with Good-Loop to offer carbon neutral private marketplace (PMP) media opportunities to help advertisers be more sustainable. [S142] ### GeoPlanet\n\nYahoo offers cartographic and geographic services via GeoPlanet. [S143] ### Yahoo Next\n\nYahoo Next is an incubation ground for future Yahoo technologies currently undergoing testing. [S144] It contains forums for Yahoo users to give feedback to assist in the development of these future Yahoo technologies. [S145] ### Yahoo BOSS\n\nYahoo Search BOSS is a service that allows developers to build search applications based on Yahoo's search technology. [S146] Early Partners in the program include Hakia, Me.dium, Delver, Daylife and Yebol. [S147] In early 2011, the program switched to a paid model using a cost-per-query model from $0.40 to $0.75 CPM (cost per 1000 BOSS queries). [S148] The price, as Yahoo explained, depends on whether the query is of web, image, news or other information. [S149] ### Yahoo Meme\n\nYahoo Meme is a beta social service, similar to the popular social networking sites Twitter and Jaiku. [S150] ### Y!Connect\n\nY!Connect enables individuals to leave comments in online publication boards by using their Yahoo ID, instead of having to register with individual publications. [S151] The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo plans to mimic this strategy used by rival Facebook Inc. [S152] to help drive traffic to its site. [S153] ### Yahoo Accessibility\n\nYahoo has invested resources to increase and improve access to the Internet for the disabled community through the Yahoo Accessibility Lab. [S154] ### Yahoo Axis\n\nYahoo Axis is a desktop web browser extension and mobile browser for iOS devices created and developed by Yahoo. [S155] The browser made its public debut on May 23, 2012. [S156] A copy of the private key used to sign official Yahoo browser extensions for Google Chrome was accidentally leaked in the first public release of the Chrome extension. [S157] ### Yahoo SearchMonkey\n\nYahoo SearchMonkey (often misspelled Search Monkey) was a Yahoo service which allowed developers and site owners to use structured data to make Yahoo Search results more useful and visually appealing, and drive more relevant traffic to their sites. [S158] The service was shut down in October 2010 along with other Yahoo services as part of the Microsoft and Yahoo search deal. [S159] The name SearchMonkey is an homage to Greasemonkey. [S160] Officially the product name has no space and two capital letters. [S161] Yahoo SearchMonkey was selected as one of the top 10 Semantic Web Products of 2008. [S162] ### Defunct services\n\nGeocities was a popular web hosting service founded in 1995 and was one of the first services to offer web pages to the public. [S163] At one point it was the third-most-browsed site on the World Wide Web. [S164] Yahoo purchased GeoCities in 1999 and ten years later the web host was closed, deleting some seven million web pages. [S165] A great deal of information was lost but many of those sites and pages were mirrored at the Internet Archive, OOcities.com, and other such databases. [S166] Yahoo Go, a Java-based phone application with access to most of Yahoo services, was closed on January 12, 2010. [S167] Yahoo 360\u00b0 was a blogging/social networking beta service launched in March 2005 by Yahoo and closed on July 13, 2009. [S168] Yahoo Mash beta was another social service closed after one year of operation prior to leaving beta status.",
    "[S169] Yahoo Photos was shut down on September 20, 2007, in favor of integration with Flickr. [S170] Yahoo Tech was a website that provided product information and setup advice to users. [S171] Yahoo launched the website in May 2006. [S172] On March 11, 2010, Yahoo closed down the service and redirected users to Yahoo's technology news section. [S173] Other discontinued services include Farechase, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase, and Yahoo for Teachers. [S174] Hotjobs was acquired by and merged with Monster.com. [S175] Yahoo Koprol was an Indonesian geo-tagging website that allowed users to share information about locations without the use of a GPS device. [S176] Koprol was acquired by Yahoo a year following its inception and, in 2011, 1.5 million people were utilizing the website, with users also based in Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam. [S177] However, eighty percent of users were Indonesian. [S178] Yahoo officially discontinued Koprol on August 28, 2012, because it did \"not meaningfully drive revenue or engagement\". [S179] Yahoo Mail Classic was announced as to be shut down in April 2013. [S180] Yahoo made a notice that, starting in June 2013, Mail Classic and other old versions of Yahoo Mail will be shut down. [S181] All users of Mail Classic are expected to switch to the new Yahoo Mail, use IMAP, or switch to another email service. [S182] In addition, April 2013 brought the closure of Upcoming, Yahoo Deals, Yahoo SMS Alerts, Yahoo Kids, Yahoo Mail and Messenger feature phone (J2ME). [S183] In early July 2013, Yahoo announced the scheduled closure of the task management service Astrid. [S184] Yahoo had acquired the company in May 2013 and was to discontinue the service on August 5, 2013. [S185] The team at Astrid has supplied its customers with a data export tool and recommended former competitors such as Wunderlist and Sandglaz. [S186] #### Twitter slide leak on changes to Yahoo\n\nOn December 15, 2010, one day after Yahoo announced layoffs of 4% of its workers across their portfolio, MyBlogLog founder Eric Marcoullier posted a slide from a Yahoo employee on Twitter. [S187] The slide was visible during an employee-only strategy webcast indicating changes in Yahoo's offerings. [S188] The following services were in a column under \"Sunset\": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. [S189] Under the \"Merge\" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle. [S190] 11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the \"Sunset\" and \"Merge\" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad. [S191] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. [S192] For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. [S193] Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nThe blog on the *del.icio.us* website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that \"Sunset\" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. [S194] Yeh further explained that other possibilities\u2014including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)\u2014were still being considered: \"We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you. [S195] Speaking for our team, we were very disappointed by the way that this appeared in the press.\" On April 27, 2011, Yahoo's sale of *del.icio.us* to Avos was announced. [S196] Yahoo Buzz was closed down on April 21, 2011, without an official announcement from Yahoo. [S197] MyBlogLog was then discontinued by Yahoo on May 24, 2011. [S198] ## Privacy",
    "[S199] In September 2013, Yahoo's transparency report said the company received 29 thousand requests for information about users from governments in the first six months of 2013. [S200] Over 12 thousand of the requests came from the United States. [S201] In October 2013, *The Washington Post* reported that the U.S. [S202] National Security Agency intercepted communications between Yahoo's data centers, as part of a program named Muscular. [S203] In late January 2014, Yahoo announced on its company blog that it had detected a \"coordinated effort\" to hack into possibly millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. [S204] The company prompted users to reset their passwords, but did not elaborate on the scope of the possible breach, citing an ongoing federal investigation. [S205] ### Storing personal information and tracking usage\n\nWorking with comScore, *The New York Times* found that Yahoo was able to collect far more data about users than its competitors from its Web sites and advertising network. [S206] By one measure, on average Yahoo had the potential in December 2007 to build a profile of 2,500 records per month about each of its visitors. [S207] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. [S208] However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits. [S209] On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a \"Do Not Track\" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements. [S210] However, on April 30, 2014, Yahoo announced that it would no longer support the \"Do Not Track\" browser setting. [S211] According to a 2008 article in Computerworld, Yahoo has a 2-petabyte, specially built data warehouse that it uses to analyze the behavior of its half-billion Web visitors per month, processing 24 billion daily events. [S212] In contrast, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) database of all United States taxpayers weighs in at only 150 terabytes. [S213] In September 2016, it was reported that data from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts was stolen in 2014. [S214] In October 2016, Reuters reported that in 2015, Yahoo! [S215] created a software to search their customers e-mail at the request of NSA or FBI. [S216] ## Criticism\n\nIn 2000, Yahoo was taken to court in France by parties seeking to prevent French citizens from purchasing memorabilia relating to the Nazi Party. [S217] In March 2004, Yahoo launched a paid inclusion program whereby commercial websites were guaranteed listings on the Yahoo search engine. [S218] Yahoo discontinued the program at the end of 2009. [S219] Yahoo was criticized for providing ads via the Yahoo ad network to companies who display them through spyware and adware. [S220] Yahoo, as well as other search engines, cooperated with the Chinese government in censoring search results. [S221] In April 2005, dissident Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years in prison for \"providing state secrets to foreign entities\" as a result of being identified by IP address by Yahoo. [S222] Human rights organizations and the company's general counsel disputed the extent of Yahoo's foreknowledge of Shi's fate. [S223] Human rights groups also accuse Yahoo of aiding authorities in the arrest of dissidents Li Zhi and Jiang Lijun. [S224] In April 2017, Yahoo was sued for failing to uphold settlement agreements in this case. [S225] Yahoo pledged to give support to the families of those arrested and create a relief fund for those persecuted for expressing their views online with Yahoo Human Rights Trust. [S226] Of the $17.3 million allotted to this fund, $13 million had been used for a townhouse in Washington, D.C., and other purchases. [S227] In September 2003, dissident Wang Xiaoning was convicted of charges of \"incitement to subvert state power\" and was sentenced to ten years in prison. [S228] Yahoo Hong Kong connected Wang's group to a specific Yahoo e-mail address. [S229] Both Xiaoning's wife and the World Organization for Human Rights sued Yahoo under human rights laws on behalf of Wang and Shi.",
    "[S230] As a result of media scrutiny relating to Internet child predators and a lack of significant ad revenues, Yahoo's \"user created\" chatrooms were closed down in June 2005. [S231] On May 25, 2006, Yahoo's image search was criticized for bringing up sexually explicit images even when SafeSearch was active. [S232] Yahoo was\u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S233] a 40% (24% in September 2013) owner of Alibaba Group, which was a subject of controversy for allowing the sale of shark-derived products. [S234] The company banned the sale of shark fin products on all its e-commerce platforms effective January 1, 2009. [S235] On November 30, 2009, Yahoo was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for sending a DMCA notice to whistle-blower website \"Cryptome\" for publicly posting details, prices, and procedures on obtaining private information pertaining to Yahoo's subscribers. [S236] After some concerns over censorship of private emails regarding a website affiliated with Occupy Wall Street protests were raised, Yahoo responded with an apology and explained it as an accident. [S237] ### Allegations of sexism against men\n\nScott Ard, a prominent editorial director, fired from Yahoo in 2015 has filed a lawsuit accusing Mayer of leading a sexist campaign to purge male employees. [S238] Ard, a male employee, stated \"Mayer encouraged and fostered the use of (an employee performance-rating system) to accommodate management's subjective biases and personal opinions, to the detriment of Yahoo's male employees\". [S239] In the suit Ard claimed prior to his firing, he had received \"fully satisfactory\" performance reviews since starting at the company in 2011 as head of editorial programming for Yahoo's home page, however, he was relieved of his role that was given to a woman who had been recently hired by Megan Lieberman, the editor-in-chief of Yahoo News. [S240] The lawsuit states:\n\"Liberman stated that she was terminating (Ard) because she had not received a requested breakdown of (his) duties. [S241] (Ard) had already provided that very information as requested, however, and reminded Liberman that he had done so. [S242] Liberman's excuse for terminating (Ard) was a pretext.\"\n\nA second sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed separately by Gregory Anderson, who was fired in 2014, alleging the company's performance management system was arbitrary and unfair, making it the second sexism lawsuit Yahoo and Meyer has faced in 2016. [S243] ## Management\n\n\n### Board of Directors\n\n* David Filo (2014) Co-founder, Chief Yahoo and Director, Yahoo Inc.! [S244] * Sue James (2010) Retired Partner, Ernst & Young LLP\n* Max Levchin (2012) Chairman and CEO, HVF, LLC\n* Marissa Mayer (2012) \u2013 CEO, Yahoo! [S245] Inc. [S246] * Thomas J.

[S253] De Castro, who previously worked for Google and McKinsey & Company, was employed to revive Yahoo's advertising business. [S254] ## Yahoo International\n\nYahoo offers a multi-lingual interface. [S255] The site is available in over 20 languages. [S256] The company's international sites are wholly owned by Yahoo, with the exception of its Japan and China sites.",
    "[S257] Yahoo holds a 34.75% minority stake in Yahoo Japan, while SoftBank holds 35.45%, Yahoo!Xtra in New Zealand, which Yahoo!7 have 51% of and 49% belongs to Telecom New Zealand, and Yahoo!7 in Australia, which is a 50\u201350 agreement between Yahoo and the Seven Network. [S258] Historically, Yahoo entered into joint venture agreements with SoftBank for the major European sites (UK, France and Germany) and well as South Korea and Japan. [S259] In November 2005, Yahoo purchased the minority interests that SoftBank owned in Europe and Korea. [S260] On March 8, 2011, Yahoo launched its Romania local service after years of delay due to the financial crisis. [S261] Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009. [S262] Since the service is pan-regional, Yahoo officially became Yahoo Maktoob in the region. [S263] On December 31, 2012, Yahoo Korea shut down all its services and left the country, with its previous domain saying in Korean, \"Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! [S264] Korea has ended. [S265] You can go to the original Yahoo! [S266] for more Yahoo's information.\" Sooner did that message also disappear, leaving with just an abandoned, empty search bar powered by Bing. [S267] Yahoo used to hold a 40% stake in Alibaba, which manages a web portal in China using the Yahoo brand name. [S268] Yahoo in the USA does not have direct control over Alibaba, which operates as a completely independent company. [S269] On September 18, 2012, following years of negotiations, Yahoo agreed to sell a 20% stake back to Alibaba for $7.6 billion. [S270] On September 2, 2013, Yahoo China shut down and was redirected to taobao.com, and has been being redirected to Yahoo Singapore's search page. [S271] ## Logos and themes\n\nThe first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994\u2014it was red with three icons on each side. [S272] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. [S273] This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. [S274] In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014. [S275] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: \"Y!\"\n\nOn August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013, at 4:00\u00a0a.m. [S276] UTC. [S277] In the period leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, the \"30 Days of Change\" campaign was introduced, whereby a variation of the logo was published every day for the 30 days following the announcement. [S278] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page. [S279] Mayer explains:\n\n> So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... [S280] We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. [S281] We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo \u2013 whimsical, yet sophisticated. [S282] Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. [S283] Having a human touch, personal. [S284] Proud. [S285] On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the \"My Yahoo\" personalized homepage. [S286] The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. [S287] Users can also select \"theme packs\" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun. [S288] Mayer then explained at a conference in late September 2013 that the logo change was the result of feedback from both external parties and employees."
