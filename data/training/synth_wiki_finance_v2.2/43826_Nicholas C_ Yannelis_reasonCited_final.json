      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the academic positions Nicholas C. Yannelis has held and the institutions associated with those roles, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the passage and identify all the sentences that mention his academic positions. Let me scan through each sentence.\n\nLooking at the passage:\n\n[S1] Nicholas C. [S2] Yannelis \u2013 This seems like a name split, maybe a formatting issue. Not sure if relevant.\n\n[S3] Yannelis \u2013 Again, just the name. Maybe part of a heading?\n\n[S4] **Nicholas C. [S5] Yannelis** \u2013 This is the start of the main entry. The bold text here mentions he is the Henry B. Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa. So that's one position and institution.\n\n[S6] He is an emeritus Commerce Distinguished Alumni Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u2013 Another position and institution.\n\n[S7] Also he was the Sir Johns Hicks Professor of Economics at the University of Manchester. \u2013 Third position and institution.\n\n[S8] His research includes... \u2013 This is about his research, not positions.\n\n[S9] He has also done works in pure mathematics. \u2013 Not relevant here.\n\n[S10] ## Biography \u2013 Heading, not a sentence.\n\n[S11] Yannelis studied undergraduate economics at the Athens University of Economics, and pursued graduate studies at the London School of Economics and the University of Rochester. \u2013 This is about his education, not academic positions.\n\n[S12] He was awarded a Ph.D. \u2013 Again, education, not positions.\n\n[S13] in Economics at the University of Rochester under the direction of Lionel W. [S14] McKenzie. \u2013 Still education.\n\n[S15] Yannelis is the editor of *Economic Theory* since 2009, *Economic Theory Bulletin* since 2013, *Studies in Economic Theory* since 1991, and the associate editor of the *Journal of Mathematical Economics* since 1993. \u2013 These are editorial positions, not academic appointments. The question is about academic positions, so maybe this is relevant? The user might consider editorial roles as academic positions. But the original question says \"academic positions\", which could be teaching or research roles. Need to check if the user considers editorial roles as part of it. The passage mentions \"Research\" section, but the question is about positions held. The answer might need to include these if they are considered academic. But the original examples in the context might not have included them. Let me check the question again. The user says \"academic positions has Nicholas C. Yannelis held, and which institutions are associated with these roles\". So positions like professor, emeritus professor, etc. The editorial roles are different. So maybe not include them unless specified. But the user might want all roles. However, the passage's sentences [S15] are about editorial positions. The user's question might not include those, but I need to stick strictly to the context. The answer should only include the positions mentioned in the context. So the main positions are the ones in [S4], [S6], [S7]. \n\nOther sentences: [S16] He became an Economic Theory Fellow in 2011. \u2013 Fellowship could be a position. But the question is about academic positions. Fellow might be a title, but not sure. The passage doesn't specify the institution for the fellowship. So maybe not include unless the institution is mentioned. \n\n[S17]-[S20] About founding a society, not academic positions. \n\nThe rest are about research and biography. \n\nSo the answer should list the three positions: Henry B. Tippie Research Professor at University of Iowa, emeritus Commerce Distinguished Alumni Professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Sir Johns Hicks Professor at University of Manchester. \n\nNow, check the citations for each sentence. \n\nThe first position is in [S4], which is part of the sentence starting with **Nicholas C. [S5] Yannelis**. The sentence is: \"Nicholas C. [S5] Yannelis is the Henry B. [S6] Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa.\" Wait, the sentence numbers here are S4, S5, S6? Wait, looking at the passage:\n\nThe actual text is:\n\n**Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis** (Greek: \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1o\u03c2 \u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03bdv\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2; born 1953) is the Henry B. [S5] Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa. [S6] He is an emeritus Commerce Distinguished Alumni Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. [S7] Also he was the Sir Johns Hicks Professor of Economics at the University of Manchester. [S8] His research includes...\n\nSo the sentence about the Henry B. Tippie Research Professor is in [S5], but the sentence starts with [S4] which is the name. Wait, the way the passage is structured, each [S#] is a sentence. So the actual sentences are:\n\n[S1] Nicholas C. [S2] Yannelis\n\n[S3] # Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis\n\n[S5] **Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis** (Greek: \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1o\u03c2 \u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03bdv\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2; born 1953) is the Henry B. [S5] Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The passage seems to have some formatting issues. Let me parse it again.\n\nLooking at the original passage:\n\nThe passage starts with:\n\n[S1] Nicholas C. [S2] Yannelis\n\n# Nicholas C. [S3] Yannelis\n\n**Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis** (Greek: \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1o\u03c2 \u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03bdv\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2; born 1953) is the Henry B. [S5] Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa. [S6] He is an emeritus Commerce Distinguished Alumni Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. [S7] Also he was the Sir Johns Hicks Professor of Economics at the University of Manchester. [S8] His research includes the study of equilibrium concepts...\n\nSo each [S#] is a sentence. So:\n\n[S1] Nicholas C. [S2] Yannelis \u2013 this is sentence 1, but it's split. Maybe a formatting error.\n\n[S3] # Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis \u2013 sentence 3, which is a heading? Not sure.\n\nThen the next sentence is [S5]: \"Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis (Greek: ...)\" \u2013 but this seems like a continuation. However, according to the given passage, each [S#] is a separate sentence. So the actual sentences that mention the positions are:\n\n[S5]: \"Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis is the Henry B. [S5] Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa.\"\n\nWait, but the [S5] is part of the sentence. So the sentence is: \"Nicholas C. [S4] Yannelis is the Henry B. [S5] Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa.\" So the citation for this sentence is [S5], but the sentence itself includes [S4] and [S5]. However, according to the user's instructions, each sentence is inside <statement> tags, and the citations are the [S#] in the passage. So the sentence that mentions the Henry B. Tippie Research Professor is [S5], and the sentence that mentions the emeritus professor is [S6], and the Sir Johns Hicks Professor is [S7].\n\nTherefore, the answer should list each position with their respective citations. So:\n\n- Henry B. Tippie Research Professor of Economics and Applied Mathematics and Computation at the University of Iowa [S5]\n- Emeritus Commerce Distinguished Alumni Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [S6]\n- Sir Johns Hicks Professor of Economics at the University of Manchester [S7]\n\nI need to make sure that each of these sentences is correctly cited. The user's example shows that each sentence in the passage is numbered, so the answer should reference those numbers."

[S21] Yannelis's early work was focused on infinite dimensional general equilibrium theory and the Aumann-Shapley value allocation. [S22] To study new problems in general equilibrium theory, Yannelis proved new mathematical results, including continuous selection theorems, Caratheodory-Type Selection Theorems, the Fatou\u2019s Lemma in infinite dimensional spaces, fixed points for discontinuous correspondences, and the upper and lower semicontinuity of set-valued functions in Banach spaces. [S23] He subsequently focused on general equilibrium theory with asymmetric information. [S24] He proposed the notion of private core and an incentive compatible notion, and further contributed to the Aumann-Shapley values by introducing differential information. [S25] Yannelis was the first to model perfect competition in an asymmetric information economy. [S26] Yannelis has worked on games and economies with discontinuous preferences. [S27] His analysis of payoff discontinuity extends the classical results in abstract economies with non-ordered preferences. [S28] Another line of his current research focuses on the ambiguity aversion in economies and games. [S29] He has shown that there is no conflict between efficiency and incentive compatibility in the presence of maximin expected utilities, which is generally false in a model with Bayesian decision making agents."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Yannelis's early work on infinite dimensional general equilibrium theory influenced his later contributions to asymmetric information economies. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. The key sections here would be the \"Research\" part. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nLooking at [S21], it mentions that Yannelis's early work was focused on infinite dimensional general equilibrium theory and the Aumann-Shapley value allocation. Then, [S22] talks about him proving new mathematical results, like continuous selection theorems, Caratheodory-Type Selection Theorems, Fatou\u2019s Lemma in infinite dimensional spaces, fixed points for discontinuous correspondences, and semicontinuity of set-valued functions in Banach spaces. \n\nLater, in [S24], it says he shifted focus to general equilibrium theory with asymmetric information. [S25] mentions he proposed the private core and incentive-compatible notions, and introduced differential information into Aumann-Shapley values. Also, [S26] states he was the first to model perfect competition in asymmetric info economies.\n\nSo, the early work involved developing mathematical tools (like those theorems and lemmas) which likely provided the foundation for his later work. The transition from infinite dimensional spaces to asymmetric information might have used these mathematical results. The citation for the early work is [S21], and the later contributions are in [S24]-[S26]. But I need to check if there's a direct link mentioned. The passage says \"To study new problems in general equilibrium theory, Yannelis proved new mathematical results...\" which led to his later focus. So the influence is through the mathematical tools developed early on enabling his later work. \n\nTherefore, the answer should connect his early mathematical contributions (from [S21] and [S22]) to his later work on asymmetric information ( [S24]-[S26]). The citations would be [S21][S22] for the early work and [S24][S25][S26] for the later contributions. But the question is about the influence, so the statement should link the two. The passage doesn't explicitly state the influence, but implies that the early work provided the necessary tools. So the answer would be that his early mathematical results enabled his later studies on asymmetric information."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the extension Yannelis's analysis of games and economies with discontinuous preferences provided to classical results and how that relates to his broader research.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Yannelis's work on games and economies with discontinuous preferences. Specifically, sentence [S27] states that he has worked on this area, and [S28] says his analysis of payoff discontinuity extends classical results in abstract economies with non-ordered preferences. That seems to directly answer the first part of the question.\n\nNow, the second part asks how this relates to his broader research. Looking at the passage, his broader research areas include equilibrium concepts with asymmetric information, infinite dimensional commodity spaces, and ambiguity. The mention of extending classical results with discontinuous preferences might tie into his work on equilibrium theory and implementation under ambiguity, as mentioned in [S8] and [S29]. Also, his work on discontinuous preferences could be part of his overall contributions to general equilibrium theory, as noted in [S22] and [S23], where he developed mathematical results that might be foundational for such extensions.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly linked. The sentence about extending classical results is [S28], and the broader research is covered in [S8] and [S29]. Also, [S27] mentions his work on discontinuous preferences, so that's relevant. However, the question is about the extension to classical results and the relation to broader research. So the main citations would be [S28] for the extension and [S8] and [S29] for the broader context. Also, maybe [S22] and [S23] as part of his mathematical contributions that support his research.\n\nWait, the user wants the answer to cite the sentences from the passage. So the first part is covered by [S28], and the relation to broader research would be in [S8] (equilibrium in games and economies with discontinuous preferences is part of his research areas) and [S29] (ambiguity aversion). Also, [S27] mentions his work on games and economies with discontinuous preferences, which is part of his broader research.\n\nSo the answer should state that Yannelis extended classical results by analyzing payoff discontinuity in abstract economies with non-ordered preferences (cite [S28]), and this relates to his broader research in equilibrium theory, asymmetric information, and ambiguity (cites [S8], [S27], [S29]). But need to check the exact sentences.\n\nThe passage says in [S8]: \"His research includes the study of equilibrium concepts in games and economies with asymmetric information; equilibrium in infinite dimensional commodity spaces; equilibrium in games and economies with discontinuous preferences; and equilibrium theory and implementation under ambiguity.\" So [S8] directly mentions discontinuous preferences as part of his research, which connects to the extension in [S28]. Also, [S29] talks about ambiguity aversion, which is another part of his broader research.\n\nTherefore, the answer should link [S28] for the extension and [S8] and [S29] for the broader context. Also, [S27] is about his work on discontinuous preferences, so that's part of the broader research. But the question is how the extension relates to his broader research. So the relation is that his analysis of discontinuous preferences (which extends classical results) is part of his broader work in equilibrium theory and related areas.\n\nSo the final answer would have two statements: one stating the extension with [S28], and another linking it to his broader research with [S8] and [S29]. Also, maybe [S27] as part of the broader research."
