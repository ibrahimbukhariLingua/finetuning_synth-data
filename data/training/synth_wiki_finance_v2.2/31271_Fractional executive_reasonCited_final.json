      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Fractional executive\n\n\n# Fractional executive\n\n\n\n**Fractional executives** are professionals who offer their management services to organizations on a for-hire, part-time basis, also known as fractional work. [S2] These executives typically have extensive experience in a business environment in roles such as chairperson, owner, CxO, senior vice president, vice president, or director. [S3] Their skills can be focused in one discipline or be more broad-based, depending on their experience. [S4] ## Overview\n\nFractional executives may work as independent contractors or as part of a fractional firm. [S5] However, they are not consultants because they take an active leadership or management role in the company that hires them, implementing changes and leading the organization just as their permanent counterpart would. [S6] They are usually hired on a long-term basis, and usually with some type of retainer, but they do not work full-time for any particular organization. [S7] They differ from consultants, interim executives, advisors, coaches, or other part-time workers. [S8] The advantage of hiring such leaders is the ability to have access to highly skilled experts while removing the cost burden of a full-time headcount. [S9] Fractional management is in the end a particular declination of interim and temporary management originated by the demand coming from small entrepreneurial companies (less than US$10 million), for which a classical temporary manager may be redundant. [S10] Specific definitions and application cases have been discussed in a congress organized by the Italian HR Directors Association (AIDP) and the Italian Chief Financial Officers Association (ANDAF). [S11] A couple of examples of specifically named Fractional Executives are Fractional CIO, Fractional CMO, Fractional COO, Fractional CEO, Fractional Sales Manager, VP of Sales, or CSO, Fractional CFO.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nThe concept has gained increasing popularity as companies seek to optimize their use of resources and bring in highly skilled leaders as needed. [S12] One notable example of the success of the fractional executive model is A-team, a fractional executive platform. [S13] In 2022, A-team announced that it had raised $60 million in funding from a group of investors led by Tiger Global and including Jay-Z's Marcy Venture Partners, indicating that the fractional executive model is gaining recognition as a legitimate and valuable approach to business leadership. [S14] The Fractional Executive model has also spread towards Europe with 10x.Team being a notable example. [S15] Furthermore, an emerging global community of fractional executives has developed, with communities like The Fractional Executive, Fractional Connections, and Fractionals United providing resources and networking opportunities for fractional executives from around the world. [S16] These communities also offer access to job listings, industry events, and educational opportunities. [S17] The fractional executive model is expected to continue growing in popularity as companies seek to optimize their resources and bring in specialized expertise on a flexible basis. [S18] With the support of major investors and the emergence of global communities, fractional executives are set to play an increasingly important role in the business world in the years to come.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for specific examples of fractional executive roles mentioned in the source and what that indicates about their versatility.\n\nFirst, I need to scan the passage for any listed examples. Looking through the text, I see a section that starts with \"A couple of examples of specifically named Fractional Executives...\" which lists several roles. Let me check the sentences here. \n\nThe relevant part is in [S11], where it mentions \"Fractional CIO, Fractional CMO, Fractional COO, Fractional CEO, Fractional Sales Manager, VP of Sales, or CSO.\" These are all specific roles. So those are the examples. \n\nNow, the second part of the question is about what this indicates regarding versatility. The passage earlier mentions that fractional executives can have skills focused in one discipline or broad-based (S3). Also, the fact that they take on various high-level roles like CIO, CMO, etc., shows they can handle different areas. Additionally, the overview states they take active leadership roles, implying they can adapt to different needs. \n\nSo the examples given (different C-suite roles) indicate that fractional executives are versatile because they can fill various critical positions, which aligns with their ability to have either specialized or broad skills. The citations would be [S11] for the examples and [S3] for the versatility aspect. \n\nWait, the user wants each sentence in the answer to have citations. So the first part stating the examples would cite [S11], and the part about versatility would cite [S3]. Also, maybe [S2] since it mentions they have experience in various roles. But the question is about the examples and what it indicates. So the answer should have two statements: one listing the examples with [S11], and another explaining versatility with [S3]. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. Let me structure that."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the fractional executive model has gained recognition and support, and what evidence from the source shows its growing legitimacy.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and identify the relevant sentences.

Then it mentions the growth in popularity due to resource optimization. \n\nLooking at the sentences, S12 says the concept has gained increasing popularity as companies seek to optimize resources. That's a key point. Then S13 mentions A-team as a notable example. S14 talks about the $60 million funding from investors like Tiger Global and Jay-Z's partner, which shows investor confidence. \n\nS15 mentions the spread to Europe with 10x.Team, indicating geographical growth. S16 and S17 discuss the emergence of global communities providing resources and networking, which adds to the legitimacy. S18 states the model is expected to grow further with investor support and communities. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the mention of A-team and the funding is S13 and S14. The communities are S16 and S17. The overall growth and investor support are in S12 and S18. Also, the spread to Europe is S15. \n\nI should structure the answer by first explaining the recognition through popularity and examples, then the evidence like funding, communities, and expansion. Each part needs the correct citations. Let me check again to ensure all citations are accurate and each statement is properly tagged."
