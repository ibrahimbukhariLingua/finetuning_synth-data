      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of embezzlement by Abdul Mannan and Proshanta Kumar Halder, along with loan defaults, on the financial stability of Bangladesh Industrial Finance Company Limited between 2012 and 2017.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the sentences to find relevant information. \n\nStarting with the embezzlement by Abdul Mannan. Sentence S2 mentions that in 2021, the company had financial trouble due to his embezzlement. S3 says the company gave large non-performing loans to Sunman Group subsidiaries, which he owned. S14 and S16 talk about him embezzling money and being a politician. S16 mentions he took 8.6 billion taka. Then S18 says he blamed a conspiracy, but that might not be directly relevant. \n\nNext, Proshanta Kumar Halder is mentioned in S5, which states he targeted BIFCL along with others. S19 mentions that in December 2017, the default rate was 96%, and the company was near liquidation. S19 also says that Proshanta Kumar Halder embezzled 5 billion taka (S19). Wait, actually, S19 says \"Proshanta Kumar Halder had also embezzled five billion taka from BIFCL.\" So that's a direct link. \n\nNow, the loan defaults. S11 mentions that in 2015, Bangladesh Bank appointed an observer. S12 states that from Dec 2012 to Dec 2016, defaulted loans jumped from 12% to 90%. S12 and S13 give the loan amounts: 840 million in 2012 and 7.8 billion in 2016. S18 mentions the default rate was 96% in Dec 2017. Also, S13 says in 2012 it was 840 million and 2016 7.8 billion. \n\nSo putting this together, the embezzlement by both individuals and the loan defaults led to a significant increase in non-performing loans, leading to the company's near collapse. The financial stability was severely impacted as the default rates skyrocketed, and the company was on the verge of collapse in 2017. The embezzlement cases would have contributed to the financial troubles, along with the loan defaults. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. For the embezzlement by Abdul Mannan, S2, S3, S14, S16, S18, S19 (wait, S19 is about Proshanta Kumar Halder). Wait, S19 says Proshanta Kumar Halder embezzled 5 billion, so that's separate. So for Abdul Mannan's embezzlement, S2, S3, S14, S16, S18. For Proshanta Kumar Halder, S5 and S19. The loan defaults are covered in S11, S12, S13, S18, S19. \n\nThe question is about the impact between 2012 and 2017. The default loans increased from 12% to 90% by 2016, then 96% in 2017. The embezzlement by both individuals would have contributed to this. So the answer should link their actions to the financial instability, citing the relevant sentences. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence in the answer should have the appropriate citations. For example, the increase in default loans from 2012-2016 is S12, the 96% in 2017 is S18. The embezzlement by Abdul Mannan is S2, S3, S14, S16. Proshanta Kumar Halder's embezzlement is S5 and S19. Also, the company being on the verge of collapse in 2017 is S13 and S18. \n\nWait, S13 says in 2012 it had 840 million loan and 2016 7.8 billion. So that's the increase in loan amounts, but the default percentage is in S12 and S18. \n\nSo the answer would be something like: The embezzlement by Abdul Mannan and Proshanta Kumar Halder, along with loan defaults, led to a surge in non-performing loans. From 2012 to 2016, defaulted loans increased from 12% to 90% (S12), and by 2017, it reached 96% (S18), causing the company to be on the verge of collapse. Abdul Mannan embezzled 8.6 billion taka (S16), and Proshanta Kumar Halder embezzled 5 billion (S19). The company's financial stability was severely impacted, leading to its near collapse. \n\nI need to split this into statements with proper citations. Each statement should be a separate <statement> with citations. For example:\n\n- The company's defaulted loans increased from 12% to 90% between 2012 and 2016 (S12).\n- By 2017, the default rate reached 96%, putting the company on the verge of collapse (S18).\n- Abdul Mannan embezzled 8.6 billion taka (S16).\n- Proshanta Kumar Halder embezzled 5 billion taka (S19).\n- The embezzlement and loan defaults contributed to the financial instability (S2, S3, S5, S12, S18, S19).\n\nBut need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence. Also, check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S11 mentions Bangladesh Bank appointing an observer in 2015, which might indicate regulatory intervention due to the issues. But the question is about the impact, so maybe that's not directly relevant unless it's part of the financial stability. \n\nAlso, S13 mentions the loan amounts increasing from 840 million to 7.8 billion, which could be part of the problem. So maybe another statement about the increase in loan amounts. \n\nSo the final answer would have multiple statements, each with their citations. Let me structure that."
