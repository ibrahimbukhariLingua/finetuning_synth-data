      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking why criticisms have emerged about using search engines like Google for e-commerce and what the current trend is to address these limitations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant sentences. The question has two parts: the reasons for criticisms and the current trends. \n\nStarting with the criticisms. The passage mentions in [S18] that \"Recently, criticisms have emerged over the limits of using search engines such as Google and Bing for use in the ecommerce cycle.\" Then, [S19] states that \"The dominance of the SEO structure in search makes competition fierce among merchants as they struggle for positioning on the Google search results pages.\" So these two sentences explain the criticisms. The main points are the fierce competition due to SEO dominance.\n\nNow, for the current trends. The passage says in [S20] \"New methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search.\" And [S21] mentions that \"As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers.\" So the trend is startups developing new methods and reinventing shopping directories.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the correct sentences. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with the citations in <cite>. Make sure each sentence is separate and the citations are correctly placed."

That's a key point about their role. Then [S11] says coupon sites provide a niche web directory centered on deal aggregation by listing only ecommerce sites that offer additional savings. So their role is to aggregate deals and coupons.\n\nNext, the perception by merchants. [S12] states that coupon sites are very popular with users but often viewed negatively by merchants. That's the direct answer here. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that add more context. [S13] lists examples like Retailmenot, Coupons.com, Groupon, but the question isn't asking for examples. The main points are in [S10], [S11], and [S12]. \n\nSo the answer should combine the role from [S10] and [S11], and the merchant perception from [S12]. Make sure to cite those sentences correctly."
