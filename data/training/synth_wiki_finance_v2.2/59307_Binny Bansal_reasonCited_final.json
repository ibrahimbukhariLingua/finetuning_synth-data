[S29] He resigned from Flipkart in November 2018 on allegations of personal misconduct. [S30] According to the *Wall Street Journal,* a Walmart investigation failed to find evidence to corroborate sexual assault claims against him but revealed \"other poor judgement calls\" in how he had handled what he termed a consensual affair with a former Flipkart employee in 2016. [S31] Binny Bansal resigned from the executive team on 28 January 2024, and has completely divested his stake.

The user wants to know how Binny Bansal's role at Flipkart evolved from co-founding the company to the Walmart acquisition and his position post-acquisition.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections. Let me scan through each part to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with the early sections: [S3] mentions he co-founded Flipkart in 2007. Then [S4] says he was COO until January 2016, then became CEO. [S5] states he was promoted to group CEO in 2017 and resigned in November 2018 due to misconduct allegations. \n\nNext, under the \"CEO of Flipkart\" section: [S24] repeats the COO to CEO promotion in 2016. [S25] and [S26] talk about his roles. Then [S27] mentions Walmart's 77% stake in 2018. [S28] says after the acquisition, he became chairman and continued as Group CEO. [S29] notes his stake value. [S30] mentions his resignation in 2018. [S32] says he resigned from the executive team in 2024 and divested his stake. [S33] mentions selling stakes to Walmart for $1.5B. [S34] gives the Walmart acquisition details.\n\nSo, putting this together: He co-founded Flipkart, became COO, then CEO, then Group CEO. After Walmart's acquisition, he was chairman and Group CEO. Then he resigned in 2018, and later fully divested his stake in 2024.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each step and cite the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Check for any other mentions, like his role post-acquisition. Also, note that after the acquisition, he was chairman and Group CEO until his resignation. The user also asks about post-acquisition position, which would be chairman and Group CEO until he left."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the sectors and initiatives Binny Bansal has invested in after leaving Flipkart and how his investment in IIT Delhi aligns with those areas.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. Let me scan through the passage to find relevant information. \n\nLooking at the sections about his investments, there's a mention under \"Investing\" that he's an anchor investor in 021 Capital, which focuses on biotechnology, agritech, and the internet. Also, he's an angel investor in several startups like BrightCHAMPS, Virgio, Flash, Hire Quotient, and Glints. Then there's the part where he invested 125 crores in IIT Delhi's endowment fund in 2019.\n\nSo the sectors he's invested in post-Flipkart include biotechnology, agritech, internet, and various startups. The initiatives would be his role in 021 Capital and his angel investments. Now, how does the IIT Delhi investment align with these? The passage doesn't explicitly state the connection, but since IIT Delhi is an educational institution, maybe it's related to tech or innovation. However, the context provided doesn't have a direct link. The user might infer that investing in IIT Delhi's endowment could be part of his broader tech and innovation interests, but since there's no explicit citation, I should only use the given info.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The investment in 021 Capital is cited as [S35], the angel investments as [S36], and the IIT Delhi investment as [S37] and [S7]. Wait, in the passage, the IIT Delhi investment is mentioned in [S7] and [S37]? Let me check again. \n\nLooking back, in Passage 1, [S7] says \"In 2019, Bansal invested in the endowment fund of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.\" Then in Passage 2, [S37] mentions the 47 companies and funding rounds. But the IIT Delhi investment is only in [S7]. Wait, the user's passage might have a typo, but according to the given text, [S7] is the correct citation for the IIT Delhi investment. Also, in the last sentence of Passage 1, it says \"In 2019, he invested 125 crores in the endowment fund of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi.\" So that's [S7] and maybe another citation? Let me check the numbers again. \n\nThe passage has [S7] and then in Passage 2, [S37] is about the 47 companies. So the IIT Delhi investment is only cited as [S7]. Therefore, the statement about IIT Delhi should have [S7]. \n\nNow, the alignment part: the question asks how his IIT Delhi investment aligns with his other sectors. Since the context doesn't explicitly state this, I can't assume. So the answer should mention the sectors and initiatives with their citations, and note that the alignment isn't explicitly explained in the provided context. But the user might expect that investing in an IIT could relate to tech or education, but without explicit info, I can't cite that. So the answer should be based strictly on the given citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about Binny Bansal's early career milestones, including his education and initial job experiences before co-founding Flipkart. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections: Early life, Career, Amazon, Founding Flipkart, CEO of Flipkart, Investing, Awards, and Personal life. The key sections here would be Early life and Career, especially the parts about education and his initial jobs.\n\nLooking at the sentences:\n\n- [S1] introduces Binny Bansal as an entrepreneur. Not directly relevant here.\n- [S8] mentions \"Early life\" section. Then [S9] states he was born around 1982/1983. [S10] talks about his parents' professions. [S11] says he's from Chandigarh. [S12] and [S13] mention his education at St. Anne's Convent School. [S14] and [S15] say he studied software programming and graduated from IIT Delhi with a computer science degree. These are his education milestones.\n\nFor initial job experiences: \n- [S16] mentions he worked at Sarnoff Corporation after college, then joined Amazon in 2007 as a software engineer. [S17] adds he was at Amazon for nine months and was rejected by Google twice. [S18] says he quit Amazon to co-found Flipkart. Also, [S22] mentions they initially thought of a comparison search engine but shifted to e-commerce. \n\nSo the key points are education at IIT Delhi, working at Sarnoff, Amazon, and then co-founding Flipkart. Need to make sure each sentence in the answer cites the correct numbers. Also, check if there are other relevant sentences. For example, [S20] mentions his co-founder Sachin Bansal from IIT, but that's more about co-founding. The question is about Binny's own education and jobs, so the IIT Delhi education is key. Also, the time at Sarnoff and Amazon before Flipkart.\n\nNeed to structure the answer with each milestone as a separate statement, each with their citations. Make sure not to include information after co-founding Flipkart, as the question is about before that. So the sentences about his role at Flipkart or later investments aren't needed here."
