      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know the different measures of yield spread mentioned in the source and an example of how a yield spread between bonds of different maturities is calculated.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage here is Passage 2, which has several sentences numbered [S1] to [S17]. Let me scan through each sentence to find the relevant information.\n\nStarting with [S5], it mentions \"interpolated spread (I-spread), zero-volatility spread (Z-spread), and option-adjusted spread (OAS).\" Those are three measures of yield spread relative to a benchmark. So that's the first part of the answer.\n\nThen, looking for the example of yield spread between different maturities. [S7] says it's possible to define a yield spread between two different maturities of comparable bonds. Then [S8] gives an example: a 10-year bond yielding 8% and a 5-year bond yielding 5%, so the spread is 8% - 5% = 3%. That's the example they're asking for.\n\nI should check if there are other mentions. [S18] and onwards talk about consumer loans, which might not be relevant here. The other sentences discuss credit spreads, TED spread, etc., but the question specifically asks about yield spread between bonds of different maturities. So the example in [S8] is the key.\n\nNow, structuring the answer. The first part lists the measures from [S5], and the example is from [S8]. Need to make sure the citations are correctly placed. Also, check if any other sentences mention other measures. [S5] is the only one that lists the three measures. The rest of the sentences either discuss other aspects like credit spreads or the example.\n\nSo the answer should state the three measures (I-spread, Z-spread, OAS) with citation [S5], and the example from [S8]. Also, ensure that each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations."

      "answer": "<statement>The TED spread and Baa-rated corporate bonds are significant benchmarks in yield spread analysis as they reflect credit risk premiums and market perceptions of economic stability. The TED spread, representing the difference between interest rates on U.S. bank loans and risk-free Treasury bills, is a key indicator of systemic risk in the banking sector. Similarly, the yield spread between Baa-rated corporate bonds and Treasuries highlights the additional risk associated with corporate debt compared to government securities. These spreads are used to assess default risk, economic outlooks, and liquidity conditions in financial markets.<cite>[S16][S17]</cite></statement><statement>Widening yield spreads, such as those between TED or Baa-rated bonds and Treasuries, signal increased market concerns about default risk, while narrowing spreads indicate improved economic confidence. For example, a broader TED spread may suggest heightened stress in the banking system, whereas a wider Baa-Treasury spread reflects greater perceived risk in corporate credit. These benchmarks are critical for investors and policymakers to evaluate market dynamics and adjust strategies accordingly.<cite>[S12][S16][S17]</cite></statement>",

The passage mentions the TED spread and Baa-rated corporate bonds in the context of yield spreads. Let me check the sentences again.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section under \"Yield spread analysis\" where it says: \"The TED spread is one commonly-quoted credit spread. [S16] The difference between Baa-rated ten-year corporate bonds and ten-year Treasuries is another commonly-quoted credit spread. [S17]\" So these two are mentioned as common benchmarks. \n\nThe question also asks about their significance. The TED spread is a measure of credit risk, reflecting the difference between the interest rates on short-term debt of U.S. banks and the risk-free rate (Treasury bills). Baa-rated bonds are investment-grade corporate bonds, and their spread over Treasuries indicates the risk premium for corporate debt. \n\nThe passage explains that yield spreads indicate risk premiums and are used to assess default risk. When spreads widen, it suggests higher perceived risk. The TED spread and Baa spreads are examples of such benchmarks. \n\nSo the answer should state that the TED spread and Baa-rated corporate bonds are key benchmarks in yield spread analysis. The TED spread measures the risk of bank loans versus Treasuries, while Baa spreads reflect corporate credit risk. They help assess market perceptions of risk and economic conditions.\n\nCitations would be [S16] for TED spread and [S17] for Baa-rated bonds. Also, other sentences might support the general significance, like [S2] about risk premium, [S12] about spreads indicating default risk, but the specific mentions are [S16] and [S17]."
