      "question": "How does the source explain the complexity of defining 'income occurrence' in a flat tax system, and what specific examples are used to highlight this challenge?",
      "answer": "<statement>The source explains that defining 'income occurrence' in a flat tax system is complex because it requires determining when income is recognized, particularly in cases involving pass-through or already-taxed earnings. This challenge arises from debates over whether certain incomes, like dividends or interest, should be taxed again after initial taxation. <cite>[S41][S42]</cite></statement> <statement>Specific examples include the taxation of stock dividends and interest income. For instance, company profits are taxed at the corporate level, and when distributed as dividends, there is debate over whether they should be taxed again as shareholder income. Similarly, interest paid on loans is deductible for the borrower but taxed as income for the lender, creating complications. <cite>[S42][S43][S45][S46]</cite></statement> <statement>The passage highlights that U.S. tax practices illustrate this complexity: dividends are not deductible, while mortgage interest is, underscoring the lack of a universal standard for fairness. It concludes that a flat tax proposal remains incomplete without clear distinctions between new untaxed income and income that has already been taxed. <cite>[S48][S49]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S24] The negative income tax (NIT), which Milton Friedman proposed in his 1962 book *Capitalism and Freedom*, is a type of flat tax. [S25] The basic idea is the same as a flat tax with personal deductions, except that when deductions exceed income, the taxable income is allowed to become negative rather than being set to zero. [S26] The flat tax rate is then applied to the resulting \"negative income,\" resulting in a \"negative income tax\" that the government would owe to the household\u2014unlike the usual \"positive\" income tax, which the household owes the government. [S27] For example, let the flat rate be 20%, and let the deductions be $20,000 per adult and $7,000 per dependent. [S28] Under such a system, a family of four making $54,000 a year would owe no tax. [S29] A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 \u00d7 (74,000 \u2212 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions. [S30] Families of four earning less than $54,000 per year, however, would experience a \"negative\" amount of tax (that is, the family would receive money from the government instead of paying to the government). [S31] For example, if the family earned $34,000 a year, it would receive a check for $4,000. [S32] The NIT is intended to replace not just the USA's income tax, but also many benefits low income American households receive, such as food stamps and Medicaid. [S33] The NIT is designed to avoid the welfare trap\u2014effective high marginal tax rates arising from the rules reducing benefits as market income rises. [S34] An objection to the NIT is that it is welfare without a work requirement. [S35] Those who would owe negative tax would be receiving a form of welfare without having to make an effort to obtain employment. [S36] Another objection is that the NIT subsidizes industries employing low-cost labor, but this objection can also be made against current systems of benefits for the working poor.\u1d43\u1d9c\u1d9c\u1d52\u02b3\u1d48\u2071\u207f\u1d4d \u1d57\u1d52 \u02b7\u02b0\u1d52\u1d50? [S37] ### Capped flat tax\n\nA **capped** flat tax is one in which income is taxed at a flat rate until a specified cap amount is reached. [S38] For example, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit (in 2025, up to $176,100 of earnings, for a maximum tax of $10,918.20). [S39] This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax. [S40] ## Requirements for a fully defined schema\n\nIn devising a flat tax system, several recurring issues must be enumerated, principally with deductions and the identification of when money is earned. [S41] ### Defining when income occurs\n\nSince a central tenet of the flat tax is to minimize the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. [S42] This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. [S43] The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits belong to them. [S44] If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed. [S45] It's a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. [S46] A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. [S47] There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. [S48] For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the source explains the complexity of defining 'income occurrence' in a flat tax system and what specific examples are used. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The relevant sections are under \"Defining when income occurs\" in Passage 1. Let me check those sentences.\n\nSentence S41 mentions that devising a flat tax system requires enumerating issues with deductions and identifying when money is earned. Then S42 says the problem is deciding when income occurs, using interest income and stock dividends as examples. \n\nS43-45 talk about shareholders and company profits. If a company is taxed, then dividends are already taxed, leading to the question of whether they should be taxed again. S46 mentions interest on loans being deductible, which is taxed as income for the lender. \n\nThe example given in S48 is that in the US, dividends aren't deductible but mortgage interest is. The key quote is in S49: \"Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.\"\n\nSo the complexity comes from determining when income is recognized, especially with things like dividends and interest. The examples are dividends (already taxed at the corporate level) and mortgage interest (deductible). The source explains that without clear rules, the tax system can't properly categorize income, leading to potential double taxation or unfairness.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check if all examples are covered and the explanation of complexity is addressed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what a fully defined flat tax proposal must explicitly address and why that distinction is critical, according to the source.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions \"Requirements for a fully defined schema\" in S40. Then, in S41, it says that several issues must be enumerated, mainly deductions and identifying when money is earned. \n\nFurther down, in S49, there's a key sentence: \"Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.\" This seems to directly answer the first part of the question. The distinction here is between new untaxed income and income that's already been taxed, like dividends or interest. \n\nThe reason this distinction is critical is because without it, the tax system might end up taxing the same income multiple times (double taxation) or not taxing it at all. The example given in the passage about dividends and interest shows that there's no universal agreement on what's fair, so explicitly addressing this ensures the tax system is equitable and avoids loopholes. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The main citation would be S49, but also S41 and S40 since they mention the requirements. However, the exact sentence about the distinction is in S49. The reason part is implied in the discussion around S41-S49, but the critical reason is because of avoiding double taxation and ensuring fairness, which is covered in the context provided."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about examples of how flat tax policies have evolved in jurisdictions that transitioned to progressive tax systems, along with the key changes. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant examples.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through Passage 1, which has several entries about different countries. Let me go one by one.\n\nStarting with Albania: They had a flat tax of 10% in 2008 and switched to two rates (13% and 23%) in 2014. That's a clear example of moving from flat to progressive. The citation would be [S143].\n\nNext, Artsakh: They had a flat tax that was reduced over the years, but then the country dissolved. However, the question is about transitioning to progressive, so maybe this isn't the best example. Maybe mention it if there's a change, but since it dissolved, perhaps not. Wait, the question is about jurisdictions that transitioned to progressive. Artsakh's example might not fit because it's more about rate reductions rather than introducing progressive rates. Maybe skip this one.\n\nBelarus: Introduced a flat tax in 2009, then increased the rate and added a second higher rate in 2024. So they moved from a single flat rate to a two-tier system. That's a progression. Citations [S146] and [S147].\n\nCzech Republic: Started with a flat 15% in 2008, but then added a 7% tax on higher incomes, leading to a second rate of 22%. Later, in 2021, they had 15% and 23%. So they evolved from a flat tax to a progressive system. Citations [S148] to [S151].\n\nGrenada: Had a flat 30% until 2014, then introduced a lower rate of 15%. That's moving to a progressive system. Citation [S152].\n\nGuyana: Flat tax of 30% until 2017, replaced with progressive rates of 28% and 40%. Citation [S153].\n\nHong Kong: Initially had a standard tax rate that was increased over time, but in 2024 introduced a second higher rate. However, the context says it was a standard tax (which might be flat) but then added a second rate. So maybe moving towards progressive. Citation [S154] to [S156].\n\nIceland: Replaced a national flat tax with progressive rates in 2010. Citation [S157] to [S159].\n\nJamaica: Had a flat tax but introduced higher rates and then went back to flat, then added another rate. The key change here is when they introduced the second rate.

      "question": "How do subnational tax rates in countries like Japan and the United States compare to their national tax systems, and what specific examples are provided in the source?",
      "answer": "<statement>Subnational tax rates in Japan and the United States are generally lower than their national tax systems, as outlined in the table within the passage. For Japan, the national tax rate is progressive, while subnational jurisdictions (prefectures) impose a flat 4% tax rate, and municipalities add a 6% tax rate [S129]. In the United States, the national tax system is progressive, but subnational jurisdictions vary: states like Arizona levy a flat 2.5% tax rate, while municipalities such as Macon County, Alabama, impose an additional 1% tax rate. Similarly, Indiana counties charge 0.5 to 3% on top of federal taxes [S129]. These examples illustrate that subnational taxes in both countries often complement or supplement the national progressive systems with lower or flat rates, depending on the jurisdiction [S129].<cite>[S129]</cite></statement>",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how subnational tax rates in countries like Japan and the United States compare to their national tax systems, and they want specific examples from the source.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages. The main information about subnational taxes is in Passage 2, which has a table. Let me check that table for Japan and the US.\n\nFor Japan, the table says the national tax rate is progressive. Then under subnational jurisdictions, all prefectures have a 4% tax rate, and all municipalities have 6%. So the subnational rates in Japan are lower than the national progressive rates. But wait, the national is progressive, which means it varies, but the subnational are fixed percentages. So maybe the subnational rates are lower for certain brackets?\n\nFor the United States, the national tax is progressive. The table shows that states like Alabama have a progressive system, while others like Arizona have a 2.5% rate. Then, municipalities like Macon County in Alabama have 1%, and some counties in Indiana have 0.5 to 3%. So the subnational rates here are lower than the national rates. For example, the federal income tax is progressive, but state and local taxes might be lower or flat.\n\nNow, the question is comparing subnational to national. The source mentions that in Japan, the national is progressive, and subnational (prefectures and municipalities) have fixed rates of 4% and 6%. In the US, the national is progressive, and subnational rates vary, with some states having lower rates and municipalities adding more. The examples given in the table for Japan and the US would be the specific numbers from the table.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The table in Passage 2 has the data. For Japan, the relevant sentence is [S129], and for the US, also [S129]. The user wants specific examples, so I should mention the exact numbers from the table. Also, check if there are other mentions in the passage. The first passage talks about other countries but not Japan and the US's subnational taxes. So the answer is based on Passage 2's table.\n\nSo the answer would state that in Japan, subnational taxes (4% for prefectures, 6% for municipalities) are lower than the national progressive rates. In the US, subnational rates like state taxes (e.g., Arizona's 2.5%) and local taxes (e.g., Macon County's 1%) are lower than the federal progressive rates. Cite [S129] for both countries."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which jurisdictions have implemented significant changes to their flat tax rates over time and the specific rate adjustments as per the source.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts. Passage 1 seems to be the main source of information about jurisdictions with flat tax changes. Let me focus on that.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a section titled \"Jurisdictions that had a flat tax\" which lists several countries and their tax rate changes. Each entry has a citation. For example, Albania introduced a flat tax in 2008 and changed it in 2014. Similarly, Artsakh, Belarus, Czech Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, Iceland, Jamaica, Latvia, and Lithuania are mentioned with their respective rate changes.\n\nI need to list each jurisdiction and their specific adjustments. Let me go through each one:\n\n- **Albania**: 10% in 2008, replaced with 13% and 23% in 2014. [S143]\n- **Artsakh**: 21% in 2014, reduced to 20% in 2019, 15% in 2021, 14% in 2022, 13% in 2023. [S144] Note that Artsakh was dissolved in 2024. [S145]\n- **Belarus**: 12% in 2009, increased to 13% in 2015, then a 25% rate in 2024. [S146][S147]\n- **Czech Republic**: 15% in 2008, then changes in 2013 and 2021. [S148][S149][S150][S151]\n- **Grenada**: 30% until 2014, then 15%. [S152]\n- **Guyana**: 30% until 2017, replaced with 28% and 40%. [S153]\n- **Hong Kong**: 10% since 1947, with increases to 12.5% in 1950, 15% in 1966, temporary increases up to 17% in 80s, 16% in 2003-08, and 16% in 2024. [S154][S155][S156]\n- **Iceland**: 22.75% in 2007, replaced with progressive rates in 2010. [S157][S158][S159][S160]\n- **Jamaica**: 25% until 2010, then higher rates, restored to 25% in 2011, then 30% in 2016. [S161][S162]\n- **Latvia**: 25% since 1997, changes in 2009-2015, replaced with progressive rates in 2018. [S163][S164][S165]\n- **Lithuania**: 33% since 1995, changes to 27%, 24%, 15%, then progressive rates in 2019. [S166][S167][S168]\n\nWait, the last citation for Lithuania is [S167] and then [S168] might be a typo? The original passage says \"In 2019, Lithuania replaced its flat tax with progressive rates of 20% and 27%.\" But the citation for that is [S167] or [S168]? Let me check again. The original text says:\n\n[S166] Lithuania introduced a flat tax of 33% on personal income in 1995. [S167] The rate was changed to 27% in 2006, 24% in 2008, and 15% in 2009. [S168] In 2019, Lithuania replaced its flat tax with progressive rates of 20% and 27%.\n\nSo [S168] is the citation for the 2019 change. But in the original passage, the user's text shows [S167] and [S168]. However, in the user's provided passage, the last line for Lithuania is [S167] and then [S168] is mentioned? Wait, looking at the original passage:\n\nThe user's Passage 1 ends with:\n\n* Lithuania introduced a flat tax of 33% on personal income in 1995. [S166] The rate was changed to 27% in 2006, 24% in 2008, and 15% in 2009. [S167] In 2019, Lithuania replaced its flat tax with progressive rates of 20% and 27%. [S168]\n\nSo the citations are [S166], [S167], [S168]. So for Lithuania's 2019 change, it's [S168].\n\nNow, I need to structure each jurisdiction with their changes and the corresponding citations. Also, check if any other jurisdictions are mentioned. The other parts of the passage mention jurisdictions without a general income tax, like Anguilla, Azerbaijan, BVI, Saudi Arabia, UAE, but those don't have flat tax changes over time, just current rates. The question is about jurisdictions that had significant changes over time, so the \"Jurisdictions that had a flat tax\" section is the key.\n\nAlso, check if any other entries in Passage 1 have changes. For example, the Czech Republic had multiple changes, so each adjustment should be noted. Similarly, Hong Kong's rate changes over time.\n\nNow, compiling all this into the required format. Each statement should be a sentence with the jurisdiction and changes, and citations. For example:\n\n<statement>Albania introduced a flat tax of 10% on personal income in 2008, and replaced it with two rates of 13% and 23% in 2014.<cite>[S143]</cite></statement>\n\nSimilarly for each entry. Need to make sure each change is a separate statement if needed, but the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. However, in the case of multiple changes in a single jurisdiction, like Artsakh, each reduction is a separate statement? Or can they be combined?\n\nLooking at the user's example, they have a sample where a sentence has multiple citations. So for Artsakh, the changes over the years can be mentioned in one sentence with multiple citations. But the original text for Artsakh is:\n\n[Artsakh introduced a flat tax of 21% on personal income in 2014, reduced to 20% in 2019, 15% in 2021, 14% in 2022, and 13% in 2023. [S144] In 2024, the country was dissolved and reintegrated into Azerbaijan. [S145]]\n\nSo the rate changes are in [S144], and the dissolution in [S145]. So the statement about the rate changes would cite [S144], and the dissolution is a separate statement with [S145]. But the question is about rate adjustments, so the dissolution might not be relevant here. So the Artsakh part would be:\n\n<statement>Artsakh introduced a flat tax of 21% on personal income in 2014, reduced to 20% in 2019, 15% in 2021, 14% in 2022, and 13% in 2023.<cite>[S144]</cite></statement>\n\nSimilarly for others. Each jurisdiction's changes are in their respective citations.\n\nNow, compiling all these into the required format. Make sure each statement is correctly cited. Also, check for any other jurisdictions in the passage. For example, the \"Jurisdictions reputed to have a flat tax\" section at the end of Passage 1 might have more info, but the user's passage ends with that section without any content. So probably no additional info there.\n\nSo the final answer should list each jurisdiction with their rate changes and the citations. Let me structure each one."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the differences between 'true flat-rate income tax' and 'marginal flat tax' as defined in Passage 2, and they want examples from Passage 1 that show the practical implications of these distinctions.\n\nFirst, I need to look at Passage 2 to find the definitions. Let me scan through it. \n\nIn Passage 2, under the \"Major categories\" section, there's a part about \"True flat-rate income tax\" and \"Marginal flat tax\". The true flat-rate tax is described as a system where one tax rate is applied to all personal income with no deductions [S13]. The marginal flat tax allows deductions, but once you're above the maximum deduction, the marginal rate on further income is constant [S14]. The key difference here is that the true flat tax has no deductions, making it more straightforward, while the marginal flat tax allows some deductions but still has a flat rate on the remaining income.\n\nNow, the question also asks for examples from Passage 1 that illustrate these distinctions. Let me check Passage 1. \n\nLooking at the examples, there are several countries that had flat taxes but then introduced additional rates. For instance, Madagascar had a flat tax of 20% until 2021 when they added lower rates of 5, 10, 15% [S169]. This seems like a marginal flat tax because they have deductions or different brackets. Similarly, Mauritius introduced a flat tax of 15% but then added a 5% solidarity levy on high income, making the top rate 20% [S171]. This additional levy could be seen as a marginal rate on higher incomes. \n\nAnother example is Montenegro, which had a flat tax but introduced a second higher rate in 2013, which was later adjusted and eliminated, then reintroduced. This shows a marginal flat tax structure where after a certain income level, the rate increases. Russia introduced a second higher rate of 15% in 2021 [S177], which again fits the marginal flat tax model. \n\nOn the other hand, a true flat-rate tax would have no deductions. However, in Passage 1, most examples have some form of additional rates or deductions, so maybe there's an example where a country maintained a true flat tax. Wait, looking through the passage, there's mention of countries like Mongolia having a flat tax until they introduced higher rates. But the true flat-rate tax would have no deductions. However, the examples in Passage 1 might not have a perfect example of a true flat tax, but the definitions in Passage 2 can be contrasted with these examples. \n\nFor instance, if a country has a single rate without any deductions, that's a true flat tax. But in Passage 1, most examples have additional rates or changes, which might indicate that they are not true flat taxes. However, the question is about the definitions and how the examples illustrate the practical implications. So the practical implications would be that when a country introduces additional rates (like Madagascar adding lower rates or Mauritius adding a solidarity levy), it's moving away from a true flat tax towards a marginal flat tax structure. \n\nSo, the answer would explain that the true flat-rate tax has no deductions, while the marginal flat tax allows deductions but has a constant marginal rate above a certain point. The examples from Passage 1, like Madagascar and Mauritius, show how introducing additional rates (which are part of marginal flat tax systems) affect the tax structure. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The definitions are in Passage 2, so S13 and S14 for the true and marginal flat tax. The examples from Passage 1 would be cited with their respective numbers, like S169 for Madagascar, S171 for Mauritius, etc."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S76] Flat tax critics contend that a flat tax system could be created with many loopholes, or a progressive tax system without loopholes, and that a progressive tax system could be as simple, or simpler, than a flat tax system. [S77] A simple progressive tax would also discourage tax avoidance. [S78] Under a pure flat tax without deductions, every tax period a company would make a single payment to the government covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. [S79] For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. [S80] Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. [S81] Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) \u00d7 0.15 = 900,000. [S82] This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees as well as the corporate taxes owed by ACME. [S83] Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. [S84] would be withheld at the source. [S85] The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. [S86] The *Economist* claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed. [S87] However, this simplicity depends on the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). [S88] Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. [S89] For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. [S90] If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% of the amount of the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. [S91] If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. [S92] The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers at the end of the period. [S93] Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies. [S94] ### Revenues\n\nRussia was considered a prime case of the success of a flat tax; the real revenues from its personal income tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the country introduced a flat tax in 2001, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year. [S95] The Russian example is often used as proof of the validity of this analysis, despite an International Monetary Fund study in 2006 which found that there was no sign \"of Laffer-type behavioral responses generating revenue increases from the tax cut elements of these reforms\" in Russia or in other countries. [S96] In 2021, Russia ended its flat tax on personal income as it introduced a second higher tax rate.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S50] Taxes, in addition to providing revenue, can be potent instruments of policy. [S51] For example, it is common for governments to encourage social policy such as home insulation or low income housing with tax credits rather than constituting a ministry to implement these policies. [S52] In a flat tax system with limited deductions such policy administration, mechanisms are curtailed. [S53] In addition to social policy, flat taxes can remove tools for adjusting economic policy as well. [S54] For example, in the United States, short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains as means to promote long-term investment horizons and damp speculative fluctuation. [S55] *Thus, if one assumes that government should be active in policy decisions such as this, then claims that flat taxes are cheaper/simpler to administer than others are incomplete until they factor in costs for alternative policy administration.*\n\n\n### Minimizing deductions\n\nIn general, the question of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to the flat tax design; deductions dramatically affect the effective \"flatness\" in the tax rate. [S56] Perhaps the single biggest necessary deduction is for business expenses. [S57] If businesses were not allowed to deduct expenses, businesses with a profit margin below the flat tax rate could never earn any money since the tax on revenues would always exceed the earnings. [S58] For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. [S59] Thus, corporations must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individuals cannot. [S60] A practical dilemma arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business. [S61] For example, if a peanut butter producer purchases a jar manufacturer, is that an expense (since the producer has to purchase jars somehow) or a sheltering of income through investment? [S62] Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. [S63] For example, the \"9-9-9\" flat tax proposal would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs, which effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate. [S64] How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax. [S65] *Thus, a flat tax proposal is not fully defined unless the proposal includes a differentiation between deductible and non-deductible expenses.*\n\n\n## Tax effects\n\n\n### Diminishing marginal utility\n\nFlat tax benefits higher income brackets progressively due to decline in marginal value. [S66] If a flat tax system has a large exemption, it is effectively a progressive tax. [S67] As a result, the term \"flat tax\" is actually a shorthand for the more proper marginally flat tax. [S68] ### Administration and enforcement\n\nOne type of flat tax would be imposed on all income once: at the source of the income. [S69] Hall and Rabushka proposed an amendment to the U.S. [S70] Internal Revenue Code that would implement the variant of the flat tax they advocate. [S71] This amendment, only a few pages long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is *not* directed at specifying graduated tax rates). [S72] As it now stands, the U.S. [S73] Internal Revenue Code is over several million words long, and contains many loopholes, deductions, and exemptions which, advocates of flat taxes claim, render the collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax law complicated and inefficient. [S74] It is further argued that current tax law slows economic growth by distorting economic incentives, and by allowing, even encouraging, tax avoidance. [S75] With a flat tax, there are fewer incentives than in the current system to create tax shelters, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance.",

[S58] For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. [S59] Thus, corporations must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individuals cannot. [S60] A practical dilemma arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business. [S61] For example, if a peanut butter producer purchases a jar manufacturer, is that an expense (since the producer has to purchase jars somehow) or a sheltering of income through investment? [S62] Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. [S63] For example, the \"9-9-9\" flat tax proposal would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs, which effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate. [S64] How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax.

[S72] As it now stands, the U.S. [S73] Internal Revenue Code is over several million words long, and contains many loopholes, deductions, and exemptions which, advocates of flat taxes claim, render the collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax law complicated and inefficient. [S74] It is further argued that current tax law slows economic growth by distorting economic incentives, and by allowing, even encouraging, tax avoidance. [S75] With a flat tax, there are fewer incentives than in the current system to create tax shelters, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the flat tax system's approach to different income types, like capital gains, affects its complexity and the implications for tax administration. They want the answer with citations from the provided passages.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context. Let me scan through the passages. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a mention under [S88] that if income types are segregated (like pass-through, long-term capital gains, regular income), complications ensue. Then [S89] talks about realized capital gains being subject to the flat tax, requiring brokers and mutual funds to calculate gains and withhold tax. [S90] and [S91] explain the withholding process for gains and losses. [S92] mentions reporting losses to the IRS, which offset gains. \n\nAlso, in Passage 2, [S54] discusses how flat taxes can remove tools for economic policy, like different tax rates for short-term vs. long-term capital gains. The note in [S55] says that if the government should be active in policy, then claims about flat taxes being simpler are incomplete without considering alternative policy costs.\n\nSo, the key points are that segregating income types adds complexity because each type needs specific handling (like calculating capital gains, withholding taxes, reporting losses). This complicates tax administration as entities like brokers have to manage these calculations. Also, the lack of deductions limits policy tools, which might require new administrative structures, affecting complexity.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing these points. Let me check the exact sentences again to make sure I get the right citations. \n\nFor the first part about complexity due to different income types: [S88], [S89], [S90], [S91], [S92]. Then the implications for tax administration: [S88], [S54], [S55]. Also, maybe [S93] mentions the IRS settling up with taxpayers, which is part of administration. \n\nWait, the user also mentioned implications for tax administration. The passage says that without deductions, policy implementation is curtailed, leading to new ministries (from [S94]). Also, in Passage 2, [S52] and [S54] talk about curtailed policy mechanisms and removing tools for economic policy, which would require alternative administration. \n\nSo, the answer should link the segregation of income types leading to more complex calculations and administrative tasks, and the implications like needing new systems for policy or increased administrative burden."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S76] Flat tax critics contend that a flat tax system could be created with many loopholes, or a progressive tax system without loopholes, and that a progressive tax system could be as simple, or simpler, than a flat tax system. [S77] A simple progressive tax would also discourage tax avoidance. [S78] Under a pure flat tax without deductions, every tax period a company would make a single payment to the government covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. [S79] For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. [S80] Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. [S81] Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) \u00d7 0.15 = 900,000. [S82] This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees as well as the corporate taxes owed by ACME. [S83] Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. [S84] would be withheld at the source. [S85] The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. [S86] The *Economist* claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed. [S87] However, this simplicity depends on the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). [S88] Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. [S89] For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. [S90] If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% of the amount of the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. [S91] If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. [S92] The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers at the end of the period. [S93] Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies. [S94] ### Revenues\n\nRussia was considered a prime case of the success of a flat tax; the real revenues from its personal income tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the country introduced a flat tax in 2001, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year. [S95] The Russian example is often used as proof of the validity of this analysis, despite an International Monetary Fund study in 2006 which found that there was no sign \"of Laffer-type behavioral responses generating revenue increases from the tax cut elements of these reforms\" in Russia or in other countries. [S96] In 2021, Russia ended its flat tax on personal income as it introduced a second higher tax rate.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S50] Taxes, in addition to providing revenue, can be potent instruments of policy. [S51] For example, it is common for governments to encourage social policy such as home insulation or low income housing with tax credits rather than constituting a ministry to implement these policies. [S52] In a flat tax system with limited deductions such policy administration, mechanisms are curtailed. [S53] In addition to social policy, flat taxes can remove tools for adjusting economic policy as well. [S54] For example, in the United States, short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains as means to promote long-term investment horizons and damp speculative fluctuation. [S55] *Thus, if one assumes that government should be active in policy decisions such as this, then claims that flat taxes are cheaper/simpler to administer than others are incomplete until they factor in costs for alternative policy administration.*\n\n\n### Minimizing deductions\n\nIn general, the question of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to the flat tax design; deductions dramatically affect the effective \"flatness\" in the tax rate.

The user is asking about the potential revenue effects of a flat tax as shown by the Russian example and how the IMF study challenges that. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The relevant part is in Passage 1 under the \"Revenues\" section. There's a mention of Russia's success with a flat tax, where personal income tax revenues increased by 25.2% in the first year, 24.6% in the second, and 15.2% in the third. That's the part about the potential revenue effects.\n\nThen, the IMF study from 2006 is cited. It says there was no sign of Laffer-type behavioral responses leading to revenue increases from tax cuts in Russia or other countries. The Laffer curve suggests that there's a tax rate that maximizes revenue, and lowering rates could increase revenue if they're above that point. But the IMF found no evidence of that in Russia's case. So the IMF study challenges the idea that the flat tax caused the revenue increases by suggesting that the increases weren't due to behavioral changes from the tax cut, but maybe other factors.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The Russian example is in [S95], and the IMF study is in [S96]. The answer should state the revenue increases and then the IMF's challenge.

[S123] It includes independent countries and other autonomous jurisdictions. [S124] The tax rate listed is the one that applies to income from work, but does not include mandatory contributions to social security.

[S127] The tax rates listed are those that apply to income from work, except as otherwise noted. [S128] Where a range of rates is listed, it means that the flat rate varies by location, not progressive rates.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S97] Bulgaria's entry into the EU in 2007 was marked by a spur of reforms aimed at reducing the large share of informal economic activity, estimated at 43% in 2006. [S98] Parliament approved the introduction of a 10% corporate income tax rate for 2007, to be followed by a 10% personal income tax rate the next year. [S99] The IMF was wary of this reform, arguing that the simplified tax system would lower the budget surplus and encourage a larger current account deficit. [S100] At the time of these discussions, however, the Bulgarian government did not need external financing and proceeded with its reform plans. [S101] The year 2007 brought a huge growth of revenue from corporate income tax (by 39% compared with the previous year) and surpassed the Ministry of Finance's own forecast (27% year on year). [S102] The budget surplus rose despite considerable emergency spending at the end of the year. [S103] There were several reasons for this beneficial effect: (i) the tax rate limited the incentives for tax evasion, (ii) the optimism at the beginning of the country's EU membership, (iii) and the increase in foreign direct investment, which reached an all-time annual record of \u20ac9 billion (about 11% of GDP). [S104] ### Overall structure\n\nTaxes other than the income tax (for example, taxes on sales and payrolls) tend to be regressive. [S105] Under such a structure, those with lower incomes tend to pay a *higher* proportion of their income in total taxes than the affluent do. [S106] The fraction of household income that is a return to capital (dividends, interest, royalties, profits of unincorporated businesses) is positively correlated with total household income.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Hence a flat tax limited to wages would seem to leave the wealthy better off. [S107] Modifying the tax base can change the effects. [S108] A flat tax could be targeted at income (rather than wages), which could place the tax burden equally on all earners, including those who earn income primarily from returns on investment. [S109] Tax systems could utilize a flat sales tax to target all consumption, which can be modified with rebates or exemptions to remove regressive effects, such as the proposed FairTax in the United States. [S110] ### Border adjustable\n\nA flat tax system and income taxes overall are not inherently border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported to a foreign country *(see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price)*. [S111] Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. [S112] The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would affect the global competitiveness of a country. [S113] However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed *Border Tax Equity Act* in the United States attempts this). [S114] Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement. [S115] Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally. [S116] In a subsequent section, various proposals for flat tax-like schemes are discussed, these differ mainly on how they approach with the following issues of deductions, defining income, and policy implementation. [S117] ## Around the world\n\nMost countries tax personal income at the national level using progressive rates, but some use a flat rate.

[S98] Parliament approved the introduction of a 10% corporate income tax rate for 2007, to be followed by a 10% personal income tax rate the next year. [S99] The IMF was wary of this reform, arguing that the simplified tax system would lower the budget surplus and encourage a larger current account deficit. [S100] At the time of these discussions, however, the Bulgarian government did not need external financing and proceeded with its reform plans.

[S111] Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. [S112] The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would affect the global competitiveness of a country. [S113] However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed *Border Tax Equity Act* in the United States attempts this). [S114] Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that contributed to the success of Bulgaria's 2007 tax reforms and how the flat tax on personal income interacted with broader economic and fiscal considerations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two main sections. Passage 1 talks about jurisdictions with flat taxes, including Bulgaria at 10%. Passage 2 discusses Bulgaria's EU entry in 2007 and the reforms they implemented. \n\nLooking at the specific sentences in Passage 2, there's a lot of relevant info. For example, [S97] mentions Bulgaria's entry into the EU in 2007 with reforms to reduce informal economy. [S98] says they approved a 10% corporate tax and then a 10% personal tax. The IMF was wary, but Bulgaria proceeded. [S101] notes they didn't need external financing. Then [S103] lists reasons for the beneficial effect: tax rate limiting tax evasion, optimism from EU membership, and increased FDI. \n\nSo the factors contributing to success would be the reduction in tax evasion due to the flat rate, the optimism from EU membership, and increased foreign investment. The interaction with broader economic considerations includes the growth in corporate tax revenue, budget surplus despite spending, and the shift in FDI. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited properly. For example, the tax rate limiting evasion is [S103], the optimism from EU membership is also [S103], and the FDI increase is [S103]. The corporate tax growth is [S101] and [S102]. The budget surplus is [S102] and [S103]. Also, the IMF's concern is [S99], but Bulgaria went ahead anyway. \n\nI should structure each sentence with the correct citations.

Also, ensure that the answer is concise and directly addresses both parts of the question: factors for success and the interaction with economic/fiscal factors."

        "[S97] Bulgaria's entry into the EU in 2007 was marked by a spur of reforms aimed at reducing the large share of informal economic activity, estimated at 43% in 2006. [S98] Parliament approved the introduction of a 10% corporate income tax rate for 2007, to be followed by a 10% personal income tax rate the next year. [S99] The IMF was wary of this reform, arguing that the simplified tax system would lower the budget surplus and encourage a larger current account deficit. [S100] At the time of these discussions, however, the Bulgarian government did not need external financing and proceeded with its reform plans. [S101] The year 2007 brought a huge growth of revenue from corporate income tax (by 39% compared with the previous year) and surpassed the Ministry of Finance's own forecast (27% year on year). [S102] The budget surplus rose despite considerable emergency spending at the end of the year. [S103] There were several reasons for this beneficial effect: (i) the tax rate limited the incentives for tax evasion, (ii) the optimism at the beginning of the country's EU membership, (iii) and the increase in foreign direct investment, which reached an all-time annual record of \u20ac9 billion (about 11% of GDP). [S104] ### Overall structure\n\nTaxes other than the income tax (for example, taxes on sales and payrolls) tend to be regressive. [S105] Under such a structure, those with lower incomes tend to pay a *higher* proportion of their income in total taxes than the affluent do. [S106] The fraction of household income that is a return to capital (dividends, interest, royalties, profits of unincorporated businesses) is positively correlated with total household income.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Hence a flat tax limited to wages would seem to leave the wealthy better off. [S107] Modifying the tax base can change the effects. [S108] A flat tax could be targeted at income (rather than wages), which could place the tax burden equally on all earners, including those who earn income primarily from returns on investment. [S109] Tax systems could utilize a flat sales tax to target all consumption, which can be modified with rebates or exemptions to remove regressive effects, such as the proposed FairTax in the United States. [S110] ### Border adjustable\n\nA flat tax system and income taxes overall are not inherently border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported to a foreign country *(see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price)*. [S111] Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. [S112] The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would affect the global competitiveness of a country. [S113] However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed *Border Tax Equity Act* in the United States attempts this). [S114] Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement. [S115] Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally. [S116] In a subsequent section, various proposals for flat tax-like schemes are discussed, these differ mainly on how they approach with the following issues of deductions, defining income, and policy implementation. [S117] ## Around the world\n\nMost countries tax personal income at the national level using progressive rates, but some use a flat rate. [S118] The vast majority of countries that have or had a flat tax on personal income at the national level are former communist countries or islands."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the historical and geographical patterns in the adoption of flat tax systems and how they reflect broader economic or political contexts. I need to use the provided supporting context to answer this.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage to find relevant information. The passage has two main sections: one about jurisdictions using flat taxes and another about Bulgaria's example. There's also mention of countries with flat taxes being former communist countries or islands.\n\nLooking at the first part, the passage lists countries with flat taxes, like Estonia, Bulgaria, Hungary, etc. It also mentions that some subdivisions within countries use flat taxes even if the national government uses progressive rates. For example, Nordic counties, Japanese prefectures, and some U.S. states. This suggests a geographical pattern where certain regions adopt flat taxes, possibly due to local economic policies or administrative simplicity.\n\nThen there's the section on Bulgaria's entry into the EU in 2007. They implemented a flat tax to reduce informal economy, which was 43% in 2006. The IMF was cautious, but the government proceeded. The result was increased revenue and foreign investment. This shows a historical context where economic reforms post-EU accession led to adopting flat taxes. The political context here is joining the EU and needing structural reforms.\n\nAnother point is that most countries with flat taxes are former communist countries or islands. This is a geographical pattern. Former communist countries might have transitioned to flat taxes as part of economic liberalization, while islands might have simpler administrative systems. The passage also mentions that flat taxes are used in subdivisions, which could be due to local governance needs or to attract investment.\n\nThe economic context includes the impact on revenue, tax evasion, and foreign investment. The political context involves EU accession and domestic reforms. The geographical aspect is the concentration in certain regions and the use by subdivisions.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. For example, the list of countries in S118, the example of Bulgaria in S97-S104, and the mention of former communist countries in S118. Also, the subdivisions using flat taxes are in S120-S121.\n\nI should make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Check that each citation is correctly numbered and that the answer addresses both historical and geographical patterns and their relation to economic/political contexts."

      "answer": "<statement>The regressive effect of a capped flat tax occurs because the tax rate is applied only up to a specified income cap, meaning higher earners pay a smaller percentage of their total income compared to lower earners. This transforms a nominally flat tax into a regressive one, as the tax burden falls disproportionately on lower-income individuals. <cite>[S39]</cite></statement> <statement>The U.S. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax illustrates this phenomenon by taxing 6.2% of gross compensation up to a cap of $176,100 (as of 2025), after which no further tax is applied. For example, an individual earning $200,000 pays FICA only on $176,100, while someone earning exactly the cap pays the same amount. This creates a regressive outcome, as higher earners effectively pay a lower tax rate on their total income. <cite>[S38]</cite></statement>",

[S29] A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 \u00d7 (74,000 \u2212 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the regressive effect of a capped flat tax and how the U.S. FICA tax example illustrates this. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a regressive tax is. Regressive taxes take a larger percentage of income from low-income earners than from high-income earners. So, a flat tax that's capped would mean that once someone's income reaches a certain limit, they stop paying the tax. But how does that make it regressive?\n\nLooking at the supporting context, there's a mention under Passage 1, S39: \"This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax.\" That's a direct statement. So the cap causes the tax to become regressive. But why? Well, if the tax is flat up to a certain income level, then higher earners pay the same rate but only on the portion up to the cap. However, if their income exceeds the cap, they don't pay anything on the amount beyond that. So, lower-income people pay the tax on their entire income, while higher earners pay less as a percentage once they hit the cap. That makes it regressive because the effective tax rate decreases as income increases.\n\nThe example given is the FICA tax. According to S38: \"the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit (in 2025, up to $176,100 of earnings, for a maximum tax of $10,918.20).\" So, if someone earns more than $176,100, they don't pay FICA on the excess. Therefore, someone earning $200,000 pays FICA on $176,100, which is 6.2% of that, but someone earning $176,100 pays the same amount. So the higher earner's tax rate on their total income is lower, making it regressive.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other citations. The question is about the regressive effect and the FICA example. The key sentences are S39 for the regressive effect and S38 for the FICA example. So the answer should cite those two sentences."

        "[S24] The negative income tax (NIT), which Milton Friedman proposed in his 1962 book *Capitalism and Freedom*, is a type of flat tax. [S25] The basic idea is the same as a flat tax with personal deductions, except that when deductions exceed income, the taxable income is allowed to become negative rather than being set to zero. [S26] The flat tax rate is then applied to the resulting \"negative income,\" resulting in a \"negative income tax\" that the government would owe to the household\u2014unlike the usual \"positive\" income tax, which the household owes the government. [S27] For example, let the flat rate be 20%, and let the deductions be $20,000 per adult and $7,000 per dependent. [S28] Under such a system, a family of four making $54,000 a year would owe no tax. [S29] A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 \u00d7 (74,000 \u2212 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions. [S30] Families of four earning less than $54,000 per year, however, would experience a \"negative\" amount of tax (that is, the family would receive money from the government instead of paying to the government). [S31] For example, if the family earned $34,000 a year, it would receive a check for $4,000. [S32] The NIT is intended to replace not just the USA's income tax, but also many benefits low income American households receive, such as food stamps and Medicaid. [S33] The NIT is designed to avoid the welfare trap\u2014effective high marginal tax rates arising from the rules reducing benefits as market income rises. [S34] An objection to the NIT is that it is welfare without a work requirement. [S35] Those who would owe negative tax would be receiving a form of welfare without having to make an effort to obtain employment. [S36] Another objection is that the NIT subsidizes industries employing low-cost labor, but this objection can also be made against current systems of benefits for the working poor.\u1d43\u1d9c\u1d9c\u1d52\u02b3\u1d48\u2071\u207f\u1d4d \u1d57\u1d52 \u02b7\u02b0\u1d52\u1d50? [S37] ### Capped flat tax\n\nA **capped** flat tax is one in which income is taxed at a flat rate until a specified cap amount is reached. [S38] For example, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit (in 2025, up to $176,100 of earnings, for a maximum tax of $10,918.20). [S39] This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax. [S40] ## Requirements for a fully defined schema\n\nIn devising a flat tax system, several recurring issues must be enumerated, principally with deductions and the identification of when money is earned. [S41] ### Defining when income occurs\n\nSince a central tenet of the flat tax is to minimize the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. [S42] This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. [S43] The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits belong to them. [S44] If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed. [S45] It's a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. [S46] A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. [S47] There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. [S48] For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the two main objections to the Negative Income Tax (NIT) and how the source contextualizes these objections in relation to existing welfare systems.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find the parts that discuss objections to NIT. Let me scan through the text. \n\nLooking at the supporting context, there's a section starting with [S34]: \"An objection to the NIT is that it is welfare without a work requirement.\" Then, [S35] explains that those receiving negative tax would get welfare without needing to work. That's the first objection. \n\nThe next part is [S36]: \"Another objection is that the NIT subsidizes industries employing low-cost labor, but this objection can also be made against current systems of benefits for the working poor.\" So the second objection is about subsidizing low-cost labor, and the source notes that this is also a problem with existing systems. \n\nNow, the question also asks how the source contextualizes these objections in relation to existing welfare systems. The first objection about work requirements isn't directly linked to existing systems, but the second one explicitly mentions that the same objection applies to current benefits for the working poor. \n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the correct sentences. The first objection is in [S34] and [S35], and the second is in [S36]. The contextualization part is in [S36] where it says the objection applies to current systems. \n\nSo the answer should list the two objections and cite the relevant sentences. The first objection's citation would be [S34][S35], and the second objection's citation is [S36]. The contextualization is part of [S36], so that's included there."

[S6] It is not necessarily a fully proportional tax. [S7] Implementations are often progressive due to exemptions, or regressive in case of a maximum taxable amount. [S8] There are various tax systems that are labeled \"flat tax\" even though they are significantly different. [S9] The defining characteristic is the existence of only one tax rate other than zero, as opposed to multiple non-zero rates that vary depending on the amount subject to taxation. [S10] A flat tax system is usually discussed in the context of an income tax, where progressivity is common, but it may also apply to taxes on consumption, property or transfers. [S11] ## Major categories\n\nFlat tax proposals differ in how the subject of the tax is defined. [S12] ### True flat-rate income tax\n\nA true flat-rate tax is a system of taxation where one tax rate is applied to all personal income with no deductions. [S13] ### Marginal flat tax\n\nWhere deductions are allowed, a 'flat tax' is a progressive tax with the special characteristic that, above the maximum deduction, the marginal rate on all further income is constant. [S14] Such a tax is said to be marginally flat above that point. [S15] The difference between a true flat tax and a marginally flat tax can be reconciled by recognizing that the latter simply excludes certain types of income from being defined as taxable income; hence, both kinds of tax are flat on taxable income. [S16] ### Flat tax with limited deductions\n\nModified flat taxes have been proposed which would allow deductions for a very few items, while still eliminating the vast majority of existing deductions. [S17] Charitable deductions and home mortgage interest are the most discussed examples of deductions that would be retained, as these deductions are popular with voters and are often used. [S18] Another common theme is a single, large, fixed deduction. [S19] This large fixed deduction would compensate for the elimination of various existing deductions and would simplify taxes, having the side-effect that many (mostly low income) households will not have to file tax returns. [S20] ### Hall\u2013Rabushka flat tax\n\nDesigned by economists at the Hoover Institution, Hall\u2013Rabushka is a flat tax on consumption. [S21] Principally, Hall\u2013Rabushka accomplishes a consumption tax effect by taxing income and then excluding investment. [S22] Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka have consulted extensively in designing the flat tax systems in Eastern Europe. [S23] ### Negative income tax",
    "[S24] The negative income tax (NIT), which Milton Friedman proposed in his 1962 book *Capitalism and Freedom*, is a type of flat tax. [S25] The basic idea is the same as a flat tax with personal deductions, except that when deductions exceed income, the taxable income is allowed to become negative rather than being set to zero. [S26] The flat tax rate is then applied to the resulting \"negative income,\" resulting in a \"negative income tax\" that the government would owe to the household\u2014unlike the usual \"positive\" income tax, which the household owes the government. [S27] For example, let the flat rate be 20%, and let the deductions be $20,000 per adult and $7,000 per dependent. [S28] Under such a system, a family of four making $54,000 a year would owe no tax. [S29] A family of four making $74,000 a year would owe tax amounting to 0.20 \u00d7 (74,000 \u2212 54,000) = $4,000, as would be the case under a flat tax system with deductions.

[S31] For example, if the family earned $34,000 a year, it would receive a check for $4,000. [S32] The NIT is intended to replace not just the USA's income tax, but also many benefits low income American households receive, such as food stamps and Medicaid.

[S37] ### Capped flat tax\n\nA **capped** flat tax is one in which income is taxed at a flat rate until a specified cap amount is reached. [S38] For example, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit (in 2025, up to $176,100 of earnings, for a maximum tax of $10,918.20). [S39] This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax. [S40] ## Requirements for a fully defined schema\n\nIn devising a flat tax system, several recurring issues must be enumerated, principally with deductions and the identification of when money is earned. [S41] ### Defining when income occurs\n\nSince a central tenet of the flat tax is to minimize the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. [S42] This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. [S43] The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits belong to them. [S44] If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed. [S45] It's a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. [S46] A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. [S47] There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. [S48] For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible. [S49] *Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.*\n\n\n### Policy administration",
    "[S50] Taxes, in addition to providing revenue, can be potent instruments of policy. [S51] For example, it is common for governments to encourage social policy such as home insulation or low income housing with tax credits rather than constituting a ministry to implement these policies. [S52] In a flat tax system with limited deductions such policy administration, mechanisms are curtailed. [S53] In addition to social policy, flat taxes can remove tools for adjusting economic policy as well. [S54] For example, in the United States, short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains as means to promote long-term investment horizons and damp speculative fluctuation. [S55] *Thus, if one assumes that government should be active in policy decisions such as this, then claims that flat taxes are cheaper/simpler to administer than others are incomplete until they factor in costs for alternative policy administration.*\n\n\n### Minimizing deductions\n\nIn general, the question of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to the flat tax design; deductions dramatically affect the effective \"flatness\" in the tax rate. [S56] Perhaps the single biggest necessary deduction is for business expenses. [S57] If businesses were not allowed to deduct expenses, businesses with a profit margin below the flat tax rate could never earn any money since the tax on revenues would always exceed the earnings. [S58] For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. [S59] Thus, corporations must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individuals cannot. [S60] A practical dilemma arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business. [S61] For example, if a peanut butter producer purchases a jar manufacturer, is that an expense (since the producer has to purchase jars somehow) or a sheltering of income through investment? [S62] Flat tax systems can differ greatly in how they accommodate such gray areas. [S63] For example, the \"9-9-9\" flat tax proposal would allow businesses to deduct purchases but not labor costs, which effectively taxes labor-intensive industrial revenue at a higher rate. [S64] How deductions are implemented will dramatically change the effective total tax, and thus the flatness of the tax. [S65] *Thus, a flat tax proposal is not fully defined unless the proposal includes a differentiation between deductible and non-deductible expenses.*\n\n\n## Tax effects\n\n\n### Diminishing marginal utility\n\nFlat tax benefits higher income brackets progressively due to decline in marginal value. [S66] If a flat tax system has a large exemption, it is effectively a progressive tax. [S67] As a result, the term \"flat tax\" is actually a shorthand for the more proper marginally flat tax. [S68] ### Administration and enforcement\n\nOne type of flat tax would be imposed on all income once: at the source of the income. [S69] Hall and Rabushka proposed an amendment to the U.S. [S70] Internal Revenue Code that would implement the variant of the flat tax they advocate. [S71] This amendment, only a few pages long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is *not* directed at specifying graduated tax rates). [S72] As it now stands, the U.S. [S73] Internal Revenue Code is over several million words long, and contains many loopholes, deductions, and exemptions which, advocates of flat taxes claim, render the collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax law complicated and inefficient. [S74] It is further argued that current tax law slows economic growth by distorting economic incentives, and by allowing, even encouraging, tax avoidance. [S75] With a flat tax, there are fewer incentives than in the current system to create tax shelters, and to engage in other forms of tax avoidance.",
    "[S76] Flat tax critics contend that a flat tax system could be created with many loopholes, or a progressive tax system without loopholes, and that a progressive tax system could be as simple, or simpler, than a flat tax system. [S77] A simple progressive tax would also discourage tax avoidance. [S78] Under a pure flat tax without deductions, every tax period a company would make a single payment to the government covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. [S79] For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. [S80] Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. [S81] Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) \u00d7 0.15 = 900,000. [S82] This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees as well as the corporate taxes owed by ACME. [S83] Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. [S84] would be withheld at the source. [S85] The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. [S86] The *Economist* claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed. [S87] However, this simplicity depends on the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). [S88] Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. [S89] For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. [S90] If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% of the amount of the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. [S91] If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. [S92] The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers at the end of the period. [S93] Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies. [S94] ### Revenues\n\nRussia was considered a prime case of the success of a flat tax; the real revenues from its personal income tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the country introduced a flat tax in 2001, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year. [S95] The Russian example is often used as proof of the validity of this analysis, despite an International Monetary Fund study in 2006 which found that there was no sign \"of Laffer-type behavioral responses generating revenue increases from the tax cut elements of these reforms\" in Russia or in other countries. [S96] In 2021, Russia ended its flat tax on personal income as it introduced a second higher tax rate.",
    "[S97] Bulgaria's entry into the EU in 2007 was marked by a spur of reforms aimed at reducing the large share of informal economic activity, estimated at 43% in 2006. [S98] Parliament approved the introduction of a 10% corporate income tax rate for 2007, to be followed by a 10% personal income tax rate the next year. [S99] The IMF was wary of this reform, arguing that the simplified tax system would lower the budget surplus and encourage a larger current account deficit. [S100] At the time of these discussions, however, the Bulgarian government did not need external financing and proceeded with its reform plans. [S101] The year 2007 brought a huge growth of revenue from corporate income tax (by 39% compared with the previous year) and surpassed the Ministry of Finance's own forecast (27% year on year). [S102] The budget surplus rose despite considerable emergency spending at the end of the year. [S103] There were several reasons for this beneficial effect: (i) the tax rate limited the incentives for tax evasion, (ii) the optimism at the beginning of the country's EU membership, (iii) and the increase in foreign direct investment, which reached an all-time annual record of \u20ac9 billion (about 11% of GDP). [S104] ### Overall structure\n\nTaxes other than the income tax (for example, taxes on sales and payrolls) tend to be regressive. [S105] Under such a structure, those with lower incomes tend to pay a *higher* proportion of their income in total taxes than the affluent do. [S106] The fraction of household income that is a return to capital (dividends, interest, royalties, profits of unincorporated businesses) is positively correlated with total household income.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Hence a flat tax limited to wages would seem to leave the wealthy better off. [S107] Modifying the tax base can change the effects. [S108] A flat tax could be targeted at income (rather than wages), which could place the tax burden equally on all earners, including those who earn income primarily from returns on investment. [S109] Tax systems could utilize a flat sales tax to target all consumption, which can be modified with rebates or exemptions to remove regressive effects, such as the proposed FairTax in the United States. [S110] ### Border adjustable\n\nA flat tax system and income taxes overall are not inherently border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported to a foreign country *(see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price)*. [S111] Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. [S112] The domestic products could be at a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would affect the global competitiveness of a country. [S113] However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed *Border Tax Equity Act* in the United States attempts this). [S114] Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit is a violation of the World Trade Organization agreement. [S115] Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally. [S116] In a subsequent section, various proposals for flat tax-like schemes are discussed, these differ mainly on how they approach with the following issues of deductions, defining income, and policy implementation. [S117] ## Around the world\n\nMost countries tax personal income at the national level using progressive rates, but some use a flat rate. [S118] The vast majority of countries that have or had a flat tax on personal income at the national level are former communist countries or islands.",
    "[S119] In some countries, subdivisions are allowed to tax personal income in addition to the national government. [S120] Many of these subdivisions use a flat rate, even if their national government uses progressive rates. [S121] Examples are all counties and municipalities of the Nordic countries, all prefectures and municipalities of Japan, and some subdivisions of Italy and of the United States. [S122] ### Jurisdictions that use flat taxes on personal income\n\n\n#### National or single level\n\nThe table below lists jurisdictions where personal income is taxed by only one government level, using a flat rate. [S123] It includes independent countries and other autonomous jurisdictions. [S124] The tax rate listed is the one that applies to income from work, but does not include mandatory contributions to social security. [S125] In some jurisdictions, different rates (also flat) apply to other types of income, such as from investments.

[S127] The tax rates listed are those that apply to income from work, except as otherwise noted. [S128] Where a range of rates is listed, it means that the flat rate varies by location, not progressive rates.",
