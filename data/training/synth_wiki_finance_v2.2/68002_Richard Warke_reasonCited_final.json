The user wants to know which companies Richard Warke has been involved with in both mining and sports, along with the key deals or partnerships.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the supporting context provided.

Then, in S3, it says he's a partner in the PGA Tour and Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool. So those are the sports companies.\n\nFor mining companies, besides the ones under Augusta Group, there's Ventana Gold Corp, which he sold to Eike Batista for C$1.6 billion (S5-S7). Then Augusta Resource Corp, sold to HudBay Minerals for C$666 million (S8-S12). NewCastle Gold and Equinox Gold (S13-S14). Arizona Mining Inc., sold to South32 for C$2.1 billion (S15-S17).\n\nI need to list each company and their key deals. Make sure to cite the relevant sentences.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question about Richard Warke's mining career from the early 2010s to 2018. The user wants to know how his career evolved during that time and the key projects or acquisitions.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context provided. The passage starts by introducing Richard Warke as a billionaire businessman and chairman of the Augusta Group, which includes Titan Mining Corp and Solaris Resources Corp. But the main career details are in the \"Career\" section.\n\nLooking at the sentences:\n\n- S5 mentions he started his career in mining over thirty years ago. But the question is about the early 2010s to 2018, so maybe that's not directly relevant unless it's part of his early career. However, the user is asking about the evolution from the early 2010s, so maybe the 30 years ago is before that. But I need to check the dates given.\n\n- S6: Sale of Ventana Gold Corp in 2011 to Eike Batista for C$1.6 billion. That's in the early 2010s. The project was La Bodega in Colombia. So that's a key acquisition/sale.\n\n- S9: In 2014, sold Augusta Resource Corp. which was focused on Rosemont Copper in Arizona. Sold to HudBay Minerals for C$666 million. That's another key project.\n\n- S13: In 2016, he built NewCastle Gold for the Castle Mountain Gold Project in California. Then a merger in 2017 (since it says one year later) leading to Equinox Gold valued at $4B. So that's a key project.\n\n- S15: In 2018, sold Arizona Mining Inc., which he founded in 2006. The project was a zinc, lead, silver mine near the US-Mexico border, with the Taylor deposit. Sold to South32 for C$2.1B.\n\nSo the evolution would be: starting with Ventana Gold in 2011, then Augusta Resource in 2014, then NewCastle Gold leading to Equinox in 2016-2017, and Arizona Mining in 2018. Each of these steps shows his progression in the mining industry through acquisitions and sales.\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with each key event and cite the relevant sentences. Each sentence in the answer should have the citations. For example, the sale of Ventana Gold in 2011 would cite S6, S7, S8. But the user wants the answer to have each sentence with its own citations. So I need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence with the correct citations.\n\nAlso, check if any other sentences are relevant. For instance, S10 mentions he was the Executive Chairman of Augusta Resource Corp., which might be part of the details. But the question is about the evolution, so the key points are the sales and projects.\n\nSo the answer would outline each major event with the corresponding citations. Let me make sure each citation is correctly linked to the event."

The sale was to HudBay Minerals for C$666 million. The significance here is the takeover and the value of the deal. Also, Warke was the Executive Chairman, which might be relevant.\n\nThen there's NewCastle Gold's Castle Mountain Gold Project in San Bernardino County, California. The merger with Equinox Gold, now worth $4B. The significance is the successful drilling and the merger leading to a high valuation.\n\nArizona Mining Inc. had a zinc, lead, and silver mine near the U.S.-Mexico border.
