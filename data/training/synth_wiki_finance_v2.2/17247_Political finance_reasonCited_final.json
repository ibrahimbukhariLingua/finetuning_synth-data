[S54] Such heavy involvement of the taxpayer calls for a maximum of transparency for political funds. [S55] ## Regulation (political finance regime)\n\nMany countries have regulated the flow of political funds. [S56] Such regulation, the political finance regime, may include bans and limits on certain kinds of income and expenditure, level and distribution of as well as access to direct and indirect public subsidies, transparency of political funds by disclosure and reporting as well as enforcement of rules and sanctions for infringements. [S57] Financing of political campaigns have become very controversial, particularly since the era of party reform in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [S58] Arguments for restricting the amount of, or banning certain sources for, campaign contributions are usually couched in terms of the public interest in clean politics, but the effects of such restrictions or bans almost invariably are to protect incumbent office holders from serious challenges from aspirants who lack their name recognition or official status.

[S61] The Hatch Act was passed in 1940 to forbid political activity by federal government employees, but the rise of the public sector union since 1961 has cemented a tight financial tie between government employees and their primary benefactors, usually Democrats. [S62] Bans on political expenditure concern either campaign expenses by non-candidates (\"independent expenditures\", \"third party advertising\") or media time paid for by political contestants. [S63] Both types of bans have to strike an adequate balance between two constitutional principles, the equality of opportunities (fairness) and the freedom of expression. [S64] Britain applies a spending limit for constituency candidates since 1883. [S65] Canada was the first democracy to add campaign limits for national party organizations in 1974 and spending limits for constituency nomination contestants in 2004. [S66] The U.S. [S67] Supreme Court (in *Buckley v. [S68] Valeo* 424 U.S. [S69] 1 (1976) has struck down spending limits because they interfere with free speech rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. [S70] Constitution.

[S72] Among the rules, which either restrict or favor specific types of political **revenue**, incentives to stimulate specific fundraising activities (like tax benefits or matching grants) are still rare.

[S75] In some democracies corporate donations for political purposes are illegal. [S76] Quite frequently political finance regimes include contribution limits. [S77] The maximum donation allowed may differ either by type of donor (individual citizens, legal entities), by recipient (candidate or party) or by purpose to be funded (nomination contest, election campaign, routine operation). [S78] In some countries (e.g. [S79] Germany) there is no statutory limit on the amount of political contributions, which a person or corporation may give to a party or candidate.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Political finance\n\n\n# Political finance\n\n\n\n**Political finance** covers all funds that are raised and spent for political purposes. [S2] Such purposes include all political contests for voting by citizens, especially the election campaigns for various public offices that are run by parties and candidates. [S3] Moreover, all modern democracies operate a variety of permanent party organizations, e.g. [S4] the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in the United States or the Conservative Campaign Headquarters, Labour Party Headquarters and the Liberal Democrat Headquarters in the United Kingdom. [S5] The annual budgets of such organizations will have to be considered as costs of political competition as well. [S6] In Europe the allied term \"party finance\" is frequently used. [S7] It refers only to funds that are raised and spent in order to influence the outcome of some sort of party competition. [S8] Whether to include other political purposes, e.g. [S9] public relation campaigns by lobby groups, is still an unresolved issue. [S10] Even a limited range of political purposes (campaign and party activity) indicates that the term \"campaign funds\" (used as subject heading in Library of Congress cataloguing) is too narrow to cover all funds that are deployed in the political process. [S11] ## Expenses for politics\n\n**Political expenses** can be caused by\n\n* election campaigns run by candidates, candidate committees, interest groups or political parties,\n* contests for nomination or re-selection of parliamentary candidates,\n* training activities for party activists, officeholders or candidates,\n* policy development by parties or party related bodies,\n* current operations of party organizations at the national, regional or local level and\n* efforts to educate citizens with regard to popular initiatives, ballot issues or referendums. [S12] Most frequently and in most countries the organizations that raise and spend money for political purposes are parties (headquarters, branches and chapters). [S13] Party headquarters spend on public relations, mass media (including billboards), the expertise of consultants and offices. [S14] Local party chapters (e.g. [S15] constituency or riding associations), which rely on volunteers (party activists), cover telecommunication and mail charges as well as rent and heating for storefront offices, which they use as their centers of political activity. [S16] ## Sources of funds\n\nPolitical revenue may be collected from small donors or individual citizens (\"grassroots fundraising\"), who make small contributions or pay party membership dues; wealthy individuals; organizations including businesses, interest groups, professional organizations and trade unions; assessments of officeholders (called the \"party tax\"); government subsidies; or generally illegal activities including graft, buying access to politicians, offices, honors or titles, extortion of wealthy people and influence peddling). [S17] G. [S18] M. [S19] Gidlund has classified the available options of fund-raising by three categories: Membership, plutocratic and public funding.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how political funds are categorized in terms of sources and what restrictions are commonly applied to specific donations. I need to look through the provided passages and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll check the supporting context. The passage mentions different sources of political funds. In Passage 1, there's a section that talks about sources like small donors, wealthy individuals, organizations (businesses, interest groups, unions), assessments of officeholders, government subsidies, and illegal activities. That's from [S16]. Also, in Passage 2, under \"Sources of funds,\" it lists similar sources: small donors, individual citizens, wealthy individuals, organizations, government subsidies, and illegal activities. That's [S16] again. Wait, maybe the same sentence is cited multiple times? Or maybe different parts. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, the \"Sources of funds\" section starts with \"Political revenue may be collected from...\" and lists the sources. The citation here is [S16]. Then, in Passage 1, there's a mention of \"incentives to stimulate specific fundraising activities (like tax benefits or matching grants) are still rare\" [S72], but that's more about incentives rather than sources. \n\nFor the restrictions, the passage talks about bans on anonymous donations [S74], contributions from foreign sources [S74], and corporate donations being illegal in some countries [S75]. Also, contribution limits or outright bans are common [S73]. The political finance regime includes bans and limits on certain kinds of income and expenditure [S56]. There's also mention of specific examples like the Hatch Act [S61], and the U.S. Supreme Court case that struck down spending limits [S67-S70]. However, the question is about restrictions on donations, not expenditures. \n\nSo, the sources are categorized as grassroots (small donors, members), plutocratic (wealthy individuals, organizations), and public funding (government subsidies). Restrictions include bans on anonymous, foreign, and corporate donations, along with contribution limits. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements citing the relevant sentences. Let me make sure each statement is correctly cited. For example, the categorization into sources would cite [S16] and maybe [S17] if there's more info. Wait, in Passage 2, the \"Sources of funds\" section is [S16], and the classification into grassroots, plutocratic, and public funding is in [S20]. So that's another citation. \n\nSo the first part about categorization would be: Political funds are categorized into sources such as small donors, individual citizens, wealthy individuals, organizations, government subsidies, and illegal activities [S16]. Additionally, Gidlund's classification includes grassroots fundraising, plutocratic finance, and public funding [S20]. \n\nFor restrictions: Common restrictions include bans on anonymous donations [S74], foreign sources [S74], and corporate donations in some countries [S75]. Contribution limits or outright bans are also common [S73]. \n\nI need to check if all these citations are correctly placed. Also, make sure each sentence is in <statement> tags with the right citations. Avoid any markdown and follow the format strictly."

[S83] Both ways serve to separate financial contributions as a means of participation from donations as means of buying access or peddling influence.

[S87] Effective reporting by parties and candidates depends on the definition of useful categories for the funds raised and spent, the inclusion of data for all spending units as well as the procedure for examination and publication of financial reports. [S88] Currently no democracy provides for full transparency of all political funds. [S89] All political finance regimes require authorities and agencies that are responsible for monitoring, control and enforcement.

[S91] Global research shows that highly sophisticated rules, over-regulation of some issues and lax implementation of such rules do not lead to best practice. [S92] ## Study of political finance\n\nThe study of political finance was pioneered by James K. [S93] Pollock and Louise Overacker. [S94] Alexander Heard contributed a groundbreaking analysis for the U.S. [S95] International comparison started with Arnold J. [S96] Heidenheimer, who also introduced the term 'political finance' to comprise campaign and party funding. [S97] Thus he was bridging the gap of perception between North America and Western Europe. [S98] Herbert E. [S99] Alexander studied the U.S. [S100] situation for many decades and edited a couple of comparative volumes. [S101] Arthur B. [S102] Gunlicks concluded this cycle of comparative studies. [S103] Daniel Lowenstein authored publications on legal aspects of campaign finance. [S104] The most important early studies on non-US countries were written by Khayyam Z. [S105] Paltiel (Canada) and Michael Pinto-Duschinsky (Britain). [S106] Between 1963 and 2001 Colin Hughes and Ernest Chaples produced the early articles that covered campaign finance in Australia. [S107] More recent contributions to the literature include Marcin Walecki's monograph on Poland, the book by Daniel Smilov and Jurij Toplak on Eastern Europe, as well as Kevin Casas Zamora's comparative analysis of public funding with two case studies from Latin America. [S108] Recently, funding from foreign sources and governments has become a major concern of governments and scholars.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S22] Many believe that as a normative concept popular government (vulgo democracy) should require that the people at large cover the costs of their democracy. [S23] However, this can only be done on a voluntary basis, because all forms of political participation in a democracy are voluntary in principle. [S24] At election times many people abstain from voting. [S25] Likewise at all times the majority of citizens also abstains from donating to political coffers. [S26] Nonetheless, many believe that broad fundraising from small donors is the ideal form of funding. [S27] Political fundraisers should try \"to exploit the latent giving power in the general population\" and make every reasonable effort to raise \"significant sums ... [S28] collected in small change.\" This is especially true for all democracies with a high standard of living for the majority of their citizens. [S29] Popular financing of politics can be an important source of political revenue (as it is in the U.S. [S30] and Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland). [S31] However, it is not a constant and reliable source. [S32] The numbers of signed-up party members who pay their dues regularly fluctuates over time wherever democratic parties care to recruit them. [S33] Today even the traditional mass-membership parties of the democratic left (Social Democrats or workers' parties) raise less than a quarter of their funds from the grassroots. [S34] Collection of small donations depends very much on the current mood of people's emotions towards politics, policies and politicians. [S35] A variety of ways are available (nationwide lotteries, direct mail drives, peer, neighborhood or internet solitication, social events at the local level, even yard sales) for grassroots fundraising. [S36] Personal (door-to-door or peer group) solicitation was quite frequent in the fifties. [S37] Since the 1960s it has been superseded by telethons and computerized mass mailings. [S38] In more recent years internet solicitation has played a major role. [S39] ### Plutocratic finance\n\nIn the old days landed aristocrats and successful entrepreneurs of the ruling classes supplied the funds necessary for democratic politics. [S40] Later on, interest groups and others provided money. [S41] Although trade unions that funded left-of-center parties were among the suppliers of money, money for campaigns came from a relatively small number of large donors. [S42] In some cases governing parties have abused their powers by rent-seeking. [S43] Some have demanded graft for a license or a favor, others *ristournes* (in Quebec) or *tangenti* (in Italy) for public procurement. [S44] In some times and places, officeholders (including MPs, legislators and councillors) have been expected to pay an 'assessment' on their salaries for political jobs. [S45] ### Public subsidies\n\nAfter World War II, politicians including Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn in Puerto Rico, Gerhard Stoltenberg in Germany, Jean Lesage in Quebec and Tage Erlander in Sweden found a way to put \"the costs of democracy\" directly upon the taxpayer. [S46] Most modern democracies (in one way or the other) provide government subsidies for party activity, typically in cash and/or free access to public or private media. [S47] India and Switzerland are the most notable exceptions. [S48] Public subsidies can be relatively small (as in the UK and USA) or quite generous (as in Sweden, Germany, Israel and Japan), and usually exist side-by-side with private fundraising. [S49] Party organizations, parliamentary groups (party caucusses) and candidates are typically the recipients of public support (in cash or kind). [S50] Although government subsidies are now common in western democracies, such subsidies remain controversial. [S51] Because matching funds and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with participatory democracy than flat grants that do not require specific efforts by the fundraising organizations.",

Let me check each of those.\n\nStarting with S80: It mentions that disclosure of donors' identity might interfere with privacy, referencing the secret ballot. Then S81 says the practical solution is to distinguish donor categories or set cut-off points, like $100 or \u20ac10,000. That's a key point. S82 and S83 explain that these methods separate contributions as participation vs. buying access. \n\nS84 talks about disclosure regulations needing to identify responsible entities and the info to disclose. S85 mentions reporting political funds with sources and expenditures. S86 gives examples of what's included. S87 discusses effective reporting depending on categories and procedures. S88 states no democracy has full transparency. S89-90 mention the need for monitoring agencies and balancing their independence with enforcement. S91 says over-regulation and lax enforcement aren't best practices.\n\nSo the main solutions are categorizing donors and setting thresholds (S81, S82, S83). Also, defining responsible entities and disclosure requirements (S84, S85, S87). The separation of contributions from undue influence is addressed in S83. \n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Check if any other sentences are relevant. For example, S80 mentions the conflict, but the solutions are in S81-83. Also, S84-S87 talk about disclosure regulations, which are part of the solutions. \n\nSo the answer should list the solutions as distinguishing donor categories, cut-off points, and defining disclosure requirements. Each part should have the appropriate citations. Also, mention how these separate contributions from undue influence, citing S83. Need to ensure that each statement is a separate sentence with its own citations."

[S83] Both ways serve to separate financial contributions as a means of participation from donations as means of buying access or peddling influence.

[S92] ## Study of political finance\n\nThe study of political finance was pioneered by James K. [S93] Pollock and Louise Overacker. [S94] Alexander Heard contributed a groundbreaking analysis for the U.S. [S95] International comparison started with Arnold J. [S96] Heidenheimer, who also introduced the term 'political finance' to comprise campaign and party funding. [S97] Thus he was bridging the gap of perception between North America and Western Europe. [S98] Herbert E. [S99] Alexander studied the U.S. [S100] situation for many decades and edited a couple of comparative volumes. [S101] Arthur B.

[S108] Recently, funding from foreign sources and governments has become a major concern of governments and scholars.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S22] Many believe that as a normative concept popular government (vulgo democracy) should require that the people at large cover the costs of their democracy. [S23] However, this can only be done on a voluntary basis, because all forms of political participation in a democracy are voluntary in principle. [S24] At election times many people abstain from voting. [S25] Likewise at all times the majority of citizens also abstains from donating to political coffers. [S26] Nonetheless, many believe that broad fundraising from small donors is the ideal form of funding. [S27] Political fundraisers should try \"to exploit the latent giving power in the general population\" and make every reasonable effort to raise \"significant sums ... [S28] collected in small change.\" This is especially true for all democracies with a high standard of living for the majority of their citizens. [S29] Popular financing of politics can be an important source of political revenue (as it is in the U.S. [S30] and Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland). [S31] However, it is not a constant and reliable source. [S32] The numbers of signed-up party members who pay their dues regularly fluctuates over time wherever democratic parties care to recruit them. [S33] Today even the traditional mass-membership parties of the democratic left (Social Democrats or workers' parties) raise less than a quarter of their funds from the grassroots. [S34] Collection of small donations depends very much on the current mood of people's emotions towards politics, policies and politicians. [S35] A variety of ways are available (nationwide lotteries, direct mail drives, peer, neighborhood or internet solitication, social events at the local level, even yard sales) for grassroots fundraising. [S36] Personal (door-to-door or peer group) solicitation was quite frequent in the fifties. [S37] Since the 1960s it has been superseded by telethons and computerized mass mailings. [S38] In more recent years internet solicitation has played a major role. [S39] ### Plutocratic finance\n\nIn the old days landed aristocrats and successful entrepreneurs of the ruling classes supplied the funds necessary for democratic politics. [S40] Later on, interest groups and others provided money. [S41] Although trade unions that funded left-of-center parties were among the suppliers of money, money for campaigns came from a relatively small number of large donors. [S42] In some cases governing parties have abused their powers by rent-seeking. [S43] Some have demanded graft for a license or a favor, others *ristournes* (in Quebec) or *tangenti* (in Italy) for public procurement. [S44] In some times and places, officeholders (including MPs, legislators and councillors) have been expected to pay an 'assessment' on their salaries for political jobs. [S45] ### Public subsidies\n\nAfter World War II, politicians including Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn in Puerto Rico, Gerhard Stoltenberg in Germany, Jean Lesage in Quebec and Tage Erlander in Sweden found a way to put \"the costs of democracy\" directly upon the taxpayer. [S46] Most modern democracies (in one way or the other) provide government subsidies for party activity, typically in cash and/or free access to public or private media. [S47] India and Switzerland are the most notable exceptions. [S48] Public subsidies can be relatively small (as in the UK and USA) or quite generous (as in Sweden, Germany, Israel and Japan), and usually exist side-by-side with private fundraising. [S49] Party organizations, parliamentary groups (party caucusses) and candidates are typically the recipients of public support (in cash or kind). [S50] Although government subsidies are now common in western democracies, such subsidies remain controversial. [S51] Because matching funds and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with participatory democracy than flat grants that do not require specific efforts by the fundraising organizations.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the text describes the role of authorities and agencies in political finance and the challenges they face in enforcing funding regulations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has two parts, Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me start by scanning Passage 1 for mentions of authorities and agencies. \n\nLooking at the sentences, I see [S89] states, \"All political finance regimes require authorities and agencies that are responsible for monitoring, control and enforcement.\" That directly addresses the role of authorities and agencies. Then [S90] mentions that legislation has to balance the agency's independence, effective enforcement, and implementation of legal stipulations. This points to the challenges they face in maintaining independence while ensuring enforcement.\n\nNext, [S91] talks about global research indicating that over-regulation and lax implementation don't lead to best practices. This suggests another challenge: balancing regulation and enforcement. \n\nNow, checking if there are other relevant sentences. [S92] refers to the study of political finance but doesn't directly address authorities' challenges. The rest of the sentences in Passage 1 either discuss disclosure rules or historical studies, which might not be directly relevant here.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's less focus on authorities and agencies. It discusses fundraising methods, plutocratic finance, and public subsidies. However, there's no direct mention of the role of authorities in enforcement here. So the main points are in Passage 1.\n\nSo, the answer should mention that authorities and agencies are responsible for monitoring, control, and enforcement (cite [S89]), and they face challenges in balancing independence, effective enforcement, and proper implementation (cite [S90] and [S91]). \n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key controversies surrounding public subsidies for political parties and how different subsidy structures like matching funds vs. flat grants relate to participatory democracy. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning Passage 1 and Passage 2 for mentions of controversies and subsidy structures.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section titled \"Public subsidies\" starting at [S46]. It mentions that public subsidies are common in Western democracies but remain controversial. The exact sentence is [S50]: \"Although government subsidies are now common in western democracies, such subsidies remain controversial.\" That's a key point about the controversy. \n\nThen, looking at the part about matching funds and flat grants. In the same Passage 2, under \"Public subsidies,\" there's a sentence: [S51] \"Because matching funds and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with participatory democracy than flat grants that do not require specific efforts by the fundraising organizations.\" This directly compares matching funds (which require individual contributions) to flat grants (which don't), and states that the former is more compatible with participatory democracy. \n\nNow, the controversies mentioned in the text. The passage doesn't go into detail about the specific controversies beyond stating that subsidies are controversial. However, in Passage 1, there's a lot about transparency and disclosure of donors, which might relate to the controversies. For example, [S80] talks about the conflict between transparency and privacy, and [S81]-[S83] discuss how disclosure regulations separate participation from buying access. But the user's question is specifically about public subsidies, so maybe those points are more about campaign finance in general rather than subsidies. \n\nThe main controversies around public subsidies might be related to the balance between transparency and privacy, as mentioned in Passage 1, but the text doesn't explicitly link that to subsidies. However, the fact that subsidies are controversial (S50) is a direct point. \n\nSo, the key controversies are the ongoing debate about whether public subsidies are appropriate, possibly due to concerns about transparency, fairness, or effectiveness. The relation between subsidy structures and participatory democracy is that matching funds (which require individual contributions) align better with participatory democracy because they involve citizens' efforts, whereas flat grants don't.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The controversy is mentioned in [S50], and the comparison between matching funds and flat grants is in [S51]. \n\nI should structure the answer with two statements: one about the controversies and one about the relation to participatory democracy, each with their citations."

The user is asking about the feasibility of achieving full transparency in political finance and the factors contributing to the challenges in implementing effective regulations. I need to look through the provided passages and find relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, looking at Passage 1, there's a mention in [S88] that says \"Currently no democracy provides for full transparency of all political funds.\" That directly addresses the feasibility, suggesting it's not achievable. Then, in [S84], it talks about the need to identify responsible parties and the information to disclose, which might be a challenge. Also, [S91] mentions that over-regulation and lax implementation don't lead to best practices, indicating that even with rules, implementation issues are a problem.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's [S22]-[S23] discussing the voluntary nature of political participation, which might relate to challenges in funding. But maybe more relevant is [S31] stating that popular financing isn't a constant source, which could affect transparency efforts.

[S54] Such heavy involvement of the taxpayer calls for a maximum of transparency for political funds. [S55] ## Regulation (political finance regime)\n\nMany countries have regulated the flow of political funds. [S56] Such regulation, the political finance regime, may include bans and limits on certain kinds of income and expenditure, level and distribution of as well as access to direct and indirect public subsidies, transparency of political funds by disclosure and reporting as well as enforcement of rules and sanctions for infringements. [S57] Financing of political campaigns have become very controversial, particularly since the era of party reform in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [S58] Arguments for restricting the amount of, or banning certain sources for, campaign contributions are usually couched in terms of the public interest in clean politics, but the effects of such restrictions or bans almost invariably are to protect incumbent office holders from serious challenges from aspirants who lack their name recognition or official status.

[S61] The Hatch Act was passed in 1940 to forbid political activity by federal government employees, but the rise of the public sector union since 1961 has cemented a tight financial tie between government employees and their primary benefactors, usually Democrats. [S62] Bans on political expenditure concern either campaign expenses by non-candidates (\"independent expenditures\", \"third party advertising\") or media time paid for by political contestants. [S63] Both types of bans have to strike an adequate balance between two constitutional principles, the equality of opportunities (fairness) and the freedom of expression. [S64] Britain applies a spending limit for constituency candidates since 1883. [S65] Canada was the first democracy to add campaign limits for national party organizations in 1974 and spending limits for constituency nomination contestants in 2004. [S66] The U.S. [S67] Supreme Court (in *Buckley v. [S68] Valeo* 424 U.S. [S69] 1 (1976) has struck down spending limits because they interfere with free speech rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. [S70] Constitution.

[S72] Among the rules, which either restrict or favor specific types of political **revenue**, incentives to stimulate specific fundraising activities (like tax benefits or matching grants) are still rare. [S73] More frequent are contribution limits or outright bans. [S74] Many countries ban anonymous donations or contributions from foreign sources. [S75] In some democracies corporate donations for political purposes are illegal. [S76] Quite frequently political finance regimes include contribution limits. [S77] The maximum donation allowed may differ either by type of donor (individual citizens, legal entities), by recipient (candidate or party) or by purpose to be funded (nomination contest, election campaign, routine operation). [S78] In some countries (e.g. [S79] Germany) there is no statutory limit on the amount of political contributions, which a person or corporation may give to a party or candidate.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Political finance\n\n\n# Political finance\n\n\n\n**Political finance** covers all funds that are raised and spent for political purposes. [S2] Such purposes include all political contests for voting by citizens, especially the election campaigns for various public offices that are run by parties and candidates. [S3] Moreover, all modern democracies operate a variety of permanent party organizations, e.g. [S4] the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in the United States or the Conservative Campaign Headquarters, Labour Party Headquarters and the Liberal Democrat Headquarters in the United Kingdom. [S5] The annual budgets of such organizations will have to be considered as costs of political competition as well. [S6] In Europe the allied term \"party finance\" is frequently used. [S7] It refers only to funds that are raised and spent in order to influence the outcome of some sort of party competition. [S8] Whether to include other political purposes, e.g. [S9] public relation campaigns by lobby groups, is still an unresolved issue. [S10] Even a limited range of political purposes (campaign and party activity) indicates that the term \"campaign funds\" (used as subject heading in Library of Congress cataloguing) is too narrow to cover all funds that are deployed in the political process. [S11] ## Expenses for politics\n\n**Political expenses** can be caused by\n\n* election campaigns run by candidates, candidate committees, interest groups or political parties,\n* contests for nomination or re-selection of parliamentary candidates,\n* training activities for party activists, officeholders or candidates,\n* policy development by parties or party related bodies,\n* current operations of party organizations at the national, regional or local level and\n* efforts to educate citizens with regard to popular initiatives, ballot issues or referendums. [S12] Most frequently and in most countries the organizations that raise and spend money for political purposes are parties (headquarters, branches and chapters). [S13] Party headquarters spend on public relations, mass media (including billboards), the expertise of consultants and offices. [S14] Local party chapters (e.g. [S15] constituency or riding associations), which rely on volunteers (party activists), cover telecommunication and mail charges as well as rent and heating for storefront offices, which they use as their centers of political activity. [S16] ## Sources of funds\n\nPolitical revenue may be collected from small donors or individual citizens (\"grassroots fundraising\"), who make small contributions or pay party membership dues; wealthy individuals; organizations including businesses, interest groups, professional organizations and trade unions; assessments of officeholders (called the \"party tax\"); government subsidies; or generally illegal activities including graft, buying access to politicians, offices, honors or titles, extortion of wealthy people and influence peddling). [S17] G. [S18] M. [S19] Gidlund has classified the available options of fund-raising by three categories: Membership, plutocratic and public funding. [S20] As the relevance of signed-up party members and their dues can vary among the democracies the terms grassroots fundraising, plutocratic finance and public funding may offer a more adequate general framework.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how public subsidies for political parties in high-subsidy countries like those in continental Europe and Japan relate to transparency requirements and the challenges these subsidies pose for political finance regulation.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions that in high-subsidy countries, public grants cover 40-60% of party budgets (S53). It also states that this heavy taxpayer involvement requires maximum transparency (S54). So, the relationship here is that higher subsidies necessitate more transparency to ensure accountability.\n\nNext, the challenges part. The passage talks about political finance regimes including transparency through disclosure and reporting, but also mentions that regulations vary. For example, some countries have bans on anonymous donations or foreign contributions (S74, S75), and there's a mention of balancing constitutional principles like free speech and fairness (S63). Also, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down spending limits due to free speech concerns (S69), which could be a challenge in regulating subsidies. Additionally, the existence of different systems, like Germany not having statutory limits (S78), shows variability that complicates uniform regulation.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. The first part about subsidies and transparency is covered by S53 and S54. The challenges would include references to varying regulations, balancing free speech, and specific examples like the U.S. case. Also, the mention of different types of regulations (bans, limits, transparency) and the difficulty in enforcement (S71) are relevant.\n\nI should structure the answer with statements linking subsidies to transparency and then the challenges, each with their citations. Need to check if all citations are correctly placed and that each statement is concise."

[S21] ### Grassroots fundraising",
    "[S22] Many believe that as a normative concept popular government (vulgo democracy) should require that the people at large cover the costs of their democracy. [S23] However, this can only be done on a voluntary basis, because all forms of political participation in a democracy are voluntary in principle. [S24] At election times many people abstain from voting. [S25] Likewise at all times the majority of citizens also abstains from donating to political coffers. [S26] Nonetheless, many believe that broad fundraising from small donors is the ideal form of funding. [S27] Political fundraisers should try \"to exploit the latent giving power in the general population\" and make every reasonable effort to raise \"significant sums ... [S28] collected in small change.\" This is especially true for all democracies with a high standard of living for the majority of their citizens. [S29] Popular financing of politics can be an important source of political revenue (as it is in the U.S. [S30] and Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland). [S31] However, it is not a constant and reliable source. [S32] The numbers of signed-up party members who pay their dues regularly fluctuates over time wherever democratic parties care to recruit them. [S33] Today even the traditional mass-membership parties of the democratic left (Social Democrats or workers' parties) raise less than a quarter of their funds from the grassroots. [S34] Collection of small donations depends very much on the current mood of people's emotions towards politics, policies and politicians. [S35] A variety of ways are available (nationwide lotteries, direct mail drives, peer, neighborhood or internet solitication, social events at the local level, even yard sales) for grassroots fundraising. [S36] Personal (door-to-door or peer group) solicitation was quite frequent in the fifties. [S37] Since the 1960s it has been superseded by telethons and computerized mass mailings. [S38] In more recent years internet solicitation has played a major role. [S39] ### Plutocratic finance\n\nIn the old days landed aristocrats and successful entrepreneurs of the ruling classes supplied the funds necessary for democratic politics. [S40] Later on, interest groups and others provided money. [S41] Although trade unions that funded left-of-center parties were among the suppliers of money, money for campaigns came from a relatively small number of large donors. [S42] In some cases governing parties have abused their powers by rent-seeking. [S43] Some have demanded graft for a license or a favor, others *ristournes* (in Quebec) or *tangenti* (in Italy) for public procurement. [S44] In some times and places, officeholders (including MPs, legislators and councillors) have been expected to pay an 'assessment' on their salaries for political jobs. [S45] ### Public subsidies\n\nAfter World War II, politicians including Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn in Puerto Rico, Gerhard Stoltenberg in Germany, Jean Lesage in Quebec and Tage Erlander in Sweden found a way to put \"the costs of democracy\" directly upon the taxpayer. [S46] Most modern democracies (in one way or the other) provide government subsidies for party activity, typically in cash and/or free access to public or private media. [S47] India and Switzerland are the most notable exceptions. [S48] Public subsidies can be relatively small (as in the UK and USA) or quite generous (as in Sweden, Germany, Israel and Japan), and usually exist side-by-side with private fundraising. [S49] Party organizations, parliamentary groups (party caucusses) and candidates are typically the recipients of public support (in cash or kind). [S50] Although government subsidies are now common in western democracies, such subsidies remain controversial. [S51] Because matching funds and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with participatory democracy than flat grants that do not require specific efforts by the fundraising organizations.",
    "[S52] Taxpayers in continental Europe and non-western democracies (like Israel and Japan) provide higher amounts towards party activity than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. [S53] Many party headquarters in the high-subsidy countries cover between 40 and 60 per cent of their annual budget via public grants. [S54] Such heavy involvement of the taxpayer calls for a maximum of transparency for political funds. [S55] ## Regulation (political finance regime)\n\nMany countries have regulated the flow of political funds. [S56] Such regulation, the political finance regime, may include bans and limits on certain kinds of income and expenditure, level and distribution of as well as access to direct and indirect public subsidies, transparency of political funds by disclosure and reporting as well as enforcement of rules and sanctions for infringements. [S57] Financing of political campaigns have become very controversial, particularly since the era of party reform in the late 1960s and early 1970s. [S58] Arguments for restricting the amount of, or banning certain sources for, campaign contributions are usually couched in terms of the public interest in clean politics, but the effects of such restrictions or bans almost invariably are to protect incumbent office holders from serious challenges from aspirants who lack their name recognition or official status. [S59] Also, Democrats in the U.S. [S60] typically inveigh against the financial advantages of the so-called \"fat cats\", while Republicans are wary of the war chests possessed by public and private labor unions, especially the former. [S61] The Hatch Act was passed in 1940 to forbid political activity by federal government employees, but the rise of the public sector union since 1961 has cemented a tight financial tie between government employees and their primary benefactors, usually Democrats. [S62] Bans on political expenditure concern either campaign expenses by non-candidates (\"independent expenditures\", \"third party advertising\") or media time paid for by political contestants. [S63] Both types of bans have to strike an adequate balance between two constitutional principles, the equality of opportunities (fairness) and the freedom of expression. [S64] Britain applies a spending limit for constituency candidates since 1883. [S65] Canada was the first democracy to add campaign limits for national party organizations in 1974 and spending limits for constituency nomination contestants in 2004. [S66] The U.S. [S67] Supreme Court (in *Buckley v. [S68] Valeo* 424 U.S. [S69] 1 (1976) has struck down spending limits because they interfere with free speech rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. [S70] Constitution. [S71] In order to be effective all limits require careful monitoring and serious enforcement backed up by adequate sanctions.

[S78] In some countries (e.g. [S79] Germany) there is no statutory limit on the amount of political contributions, which a person or corporation may give to a party or candidate.",
    "[S80] If rules for transparency of political funds stipulate the disclosure of donors' identity, the public's right to know about financial backers may interfere with the need to protect the privacy of political preferences, the principle of the secret ballot. [S81] The practical solution will distinguish between categories of donors and/ or define cut-off points for privacy, e.g. [S82] $100 or \u20ac10,000. [S83] Both ways serve to separate financial contributions as a means of participation from donations as means of buying access or peddling influence. [S84] Any disclosure regulation has to identify a person or an institution that is responsible for the transparent flow of funds to and from party coffers and the kind of information, which has to be disclosed timely and accessibly. [S85] The reporting' of political funds (to be submitted annually and/ or after elections) usually includes various sources of income and specified items of expenditure, e.g. [S86] staff and offices, advertisements in print media, radio and TV, campaign material, direct mailing, opinion polling. [S87] Effective reporting by parties and candidates depends on the definition of useful categories for the funds raised and spent, the inclusion of data for all spending units as well as the procedure for examination and publication of financial reports. [S88] Currently no democracy provides for full transparency of all political funds. [S89] All political finance regimes require authorities and agencies that are responsible for monitoring, control and enforcement. [S90] Legislation has to strike a balance between practical independence of the agency in charge, effective enforcement of the rules for the funding of political competition and adequate implementation of legal stipulations. [S91] Global research shows that highly sophisticated rules, over-regulation of some issues and lax implementation of such rules do not lead to best practice. [S92] ## Study of political finance\n\nThe study of political finance was pioneered by James K. [S93] Pollock and Louise Overacker. [S94] Alexander Heard contributed a groundbreaking analysis for the U.S. [S95] International comparison started with Arnold J. [S96] Heidenheimer, who also introduced the term 'political finance' to comprise campaign and party funding. [S97] Thus he was bridging the gap of perception between North America and Western Europe. [S98] Herbert E. [S99] Alexander studied the U.S. [S100] situation for many decades and edited a couple of comparative volumes. [S101] Arthur B. [S102] Gunlicks concluded this cycle of comparative studies. [S103] Daniel Lowenstein authored publications on legal aspects of campaign finance. [S104] The most important early studies on non-US countries were written by Khayyam Z. [S105] Paltiel (Canada) and Michael Pinto-Duschinsky (Britain). [S106] Between 1963 and 2001 Colin Hughes and Ernest Chaples produced the early articles that covered campaign finance in Australia. [S107] More recent contributions to the literature include Marcin Walecki's monograph on Poland, the book by Daniel Smilov and Jurij Toplak on Eastern Europe, as well as Kevin Casas Zamora's comparative analysis of public funding with two case studies from Latin America.
