      "answer": "<statement>Audience metrics like CUME (Cumulative Audience) and PUT (People Using Television) influence advertising strategies by providing insights into audience reach and exposure. CUME measures the number of *different* listeners or viewers in a given time period, reflecting *reach*, while PUT measures the total number of people tuned to any channel during a specific time, indicating *immediate audience size*. Advertisers use these metrics to assess the effectiveness of media channels and set advertising rates based on audience quality and size.<cite>[S280][S281][S270]</cite></statement><statement>Media scheduling considers optimizing these metrics by aligning ad placements with consumer behavior. For instance, advertisers aim to position ads close to the purchase decision point, such as scheduling TV ads for general brand awareness and radio spots during shopping trips to maximize PUT. Flighted schedules, which involve repeated ad runs, build on previous exposure to maintain awareness, leveraging CUME over time while balancing costs.<cite>[S303][S304][S302][S305]</cite></statement><statement>Additionally, media planners prioritize timing and audience profiles to ensure ads reach the right demographics. For example, understanding audience movement by session (channel switching) and audience share helps refine scheduling to capture higher CUME and PUT, ensuring ads are neither wasted on low-engagement periods nor underutilized during peak times.<cite>[S278][S274]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S258] Media audience research is a central feature of media planning. [S259] The main purpose of media research is \"to eliminate waste in advertising by objectively analysing the media available for promoting products and services\". [S260] Identifying and profiling the audience for print media, broadcast media, cinema and online media magazine or newspaper is a specialized form of market research, often conducted on behalf of media owners. [S261] In most nations, the advertising industry, via its peak industry associations, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement for main media. [S262] The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the *industry currency* in audience measurement. [S263] Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings. [S264] In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. [S265] In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency. [S266] Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where and when media is used and the cost of data collection. [S267] All these methods involve sampling \u2013 that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population. [S268] Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process. [S269] Media research acts as form of industry regulation and the legitimacy of research methodologies and provision of audience metrics. [S270] Media owners rely on metrics of both audience size and audience quality to set advertising rates. [S271] Measures of media audience that are of especial interest to advertisers include:\n\n**Print Media**\n\n* *Circulation:* the number of copies of an issue sold (independently assessed via a circulation audit)\n* *Readership:* the total number of people who have seen or looked into a current edition of the a publication (independently measured via survey)\n* *Readership profiles:* Demographic/ psychographic and behavioural analysis of readership (sourced from Readership surveys)\n\n**Broadcast Media**\n\n* *Average audience:* The average number of people who tuned into the given time or given program, expressed in thousands or as a percentage. [S272] Also known as a *Rating* or T.A.R.P (Total Audience Rating Point). [S273] * *Audience share:* The number of listeners (or viewers) for a given channel over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the total audience potential for the total market. [S274] (The audience share is normally calculated by dividing a given channel's average audience by the average audience of all channels). [S275] * *Audience potential:* The total number of people in a given geographical area who conform to a specific definition, such as the number of people with a television (or radio) set or the total number of people aged 6\u201312 years. [S276] Population potentials are normally derived from the census figures and are used to estimate the potential market reach. [S277] * *Audience movement by session:* The number of listeners (or viewers) who switch channels during a given time period. [S278] * *Audience profile:* Analysis of audience by selected demographic, psychographic or behavioural variables. [S279] * *Cumulative audience (CUME):* The number of *different* listeners (or viewers) in a given time period; also known as *reach*. [S280] * *People Using Television (PUT)*: The number of people (or households) tuned to any channel during a given time period.

[S299] Broadly, there are four basic approaches to scheduling:\n\nEmpirical support for the effectiveness of pulsing is relatively weak. [S300] However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall. [S301] With flighted schedules, the second and subsequent flights tend to build on the first flight, resulting in awareness levels similar to a continuous schedule, but often with reduced costs. [S302] A major consideration in constructing media schedules is timing. [S303] The advertiser's main is to place the advertisement as close as practical to the point where consumers make their purchase decision. [S304] For example, an advertiser who knows that a grocery buyer does a main shop on Saturday afternoons and a top-up shop on Wednesday nights, may consider TV to achieve general brand awareness, supplemented with radio spots to reach the shopper while he or she is driving to the supermarket or regular place of purchase on the days when the majority of consumers carry out their shopping. [S305] ## Measuring advertising effectiveness\n\nAdvertising is a major expense for most firms. [S306] Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. [S307] Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. [S308] Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects. [S309] The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates. [S310] Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing: Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects. [S311] * *Pre-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses\n\n* *Post-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives. [S312] ### Pre-testing\n\nSound pre-testing exhibits the following characteristics:\n\nSpecific types of pre-testing include copy tests, projective techniques and increasingly, a diverse range of physiological and/or biometric testing methods. [S313] #### Copy testing\n\nCopy testing is testing that evaluates advertising copy and creative executions. [S314] In this section, the principal methods of copy testing are briefly discussed. [S315] ##### Mock-ups\n\nResearchers often use mock-ups of the final creative with varying degrees of finished artwork. [S316] Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. [S317] However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. [S318] Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. [S319] A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how audience metrics like CUME and PUT influence advertising strategies and what considerations are made in media scheduling to optimize these metrics.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions CUME and PUT in the section about broadcast media. Let me check those sentences. \n\nLooking at the passage, under Broadcast Media, there's a point about Cumulative audience (CUME): \"The number of different listeners (or viewers) in a given time period; also known as reach.\" And for PUT: \"The number of people (or households) tuned to any channel during a given time period.\" So CUME relates to reach, which is the number of unique individuals exposed, while PUT is about the total number of people watching at a given time.\n\nNow, how do these metrics influence advertising strategies? The passage says that media owners use metrics like audience size and quality to set advertising rates. So higher CUME would mean broader reach, which is valuable for advertisers wanting to maximize exposure. PUT might be important for ensuring that the ad is seen by a large audience at the same time, maybe for real-time engagement.\n\nIn terms of media scheduling, the passage mentions that the main goal is to place ads close to the purchase decision point. So if an advertiser knows their audience's habits, they might schedule ads during times when the audience is most likely to be watching (high PUT) or when they can reach the maximum unique viewers (high CUME). For example, if a product is bought on weekends, scheduling during peak times when PUT is high could be effective. Also, the passage talks about flighted schedules where multiple flights build on each other, which might help in maintaining reach (CUME) over time.\n\nThe passage also mentions that media scheduling considers timing, like when consumers make purchases. So advertisers might use CUME to ensure they're reaching as many different people as possible over the campaign period, and PUT to target specific times when the audience is largest. The example given about TV and radio ads aligns with this, using TV for general awareness (possibly targeting CUME) and radio for when people are shopping (targeting PUT).\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For CUME and PUT, the relevant sentences are [S280] and [S281]. For media scheduling considerations, the sentences about timing and placement near purchase decisions are [S303] and [S304], and the example in [S305]. Also, the part about flighted schedules building on previous ones is [S302].\n\nSo the answer should connect CUME and PUT to reach and audience size, explaining how they affect ad strategies. Then, discuss media scheduling considerations like timing and flighted schedules. Each statement needs citations from the passage."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S115] *Quadrant 2*: High-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the second quadrant, audiences exhibit an emotional response to advertisements which transfers to products. [S116] This approach is used for products such as jewellery, expensive perfumes and designer fashion where consumers are emotionally involved in the purchase. [S117] When this mode of purchasing is evident, advertising should be designed to create a strong brand image and media should be selected to support the relevant image. [S118] For example, magazines such as *Vogue* can help to create an up-market image. [S119] *Quadrant 3*: Low-involvement/ rational purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident for many packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. [S120] Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption the benefit of using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). [S121] Given that this is a rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. [S122] Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy should be weighted towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion. [S123] *Quadrant 4*: Low-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the final quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases that make them feel good. [S124] Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. [S125] The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. [S126] When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should \"congratulate\" customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they are close to the point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays. [S127] Examples of this approach include \"McDonald's \u2013 You Deserve a Break Today\" and \"L'Oreal- Because You're Worth It\". [S128] ### Hierarchy-free models\n\nMany authors have treated reason (rational processes) and emotion (affective processes) as entirely independent. [S129] Yet, other researchers have argued that both reason and emotion can be employed simultaneously, to process advertising information. [S130] Hierarchy-free models draw on evidence from psychology and consumer neuroscience which suggest that consumers process information via different pathways rather than in any linear/ sequential manner. [S131] Thus, hierarchy-free models do not employ any fixed processing sequence. [S132] These models treat advertising as part of the brand totality. [S133] Some hierarchy-free models treat brands as 'myth' and advertising as 'myth-making' while other models seek to tap into the consumer's memories of pleasant consumption experiences (e.g. [S134] the MAC- Memory-Affect-Cognition model). [S135] Hierarchy-free models are of increasing interest to academics and practitioners because they are more customer-centric and allow for the possibility of consumer co-creation of value. [S136] ## Advertising planning\n\nAdvertising planning does not occur in a vacuum. [S137] Advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives. [S138] Therefore, the first step in any advertising planning is to review to the objectives as set out in the marketing plan. [S139] This is designed to ensure that all promotional efforts, including advertising, are working towards achieving both short-term and long-term corporate and marketing goals and align with the company's values and vision. [S140] ### Review the marketing plan\n\nA review of the marketing plan can be a relatively simple process, or it can involve a formal review, known as an *audit*. [S141] The review or audit might consider such issues as prior marketing communications activity, an evaluation of what has been effective in the past, whether new market research studies are warranted, an outline of competitive advertising activity and a review of budgetary considerations.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S348] Starch scores were developed by Daniel Starch in the 1920s to evaluate the copy effectiveness of print advertisements and are still in use today. [S349] A consumer is shown a magazine page by page and subsequently asked whether they had noticed any part an advertisement. [S350] If they answer, 'Yes', the interviewer asks the respondent to indicate which parts of the ad were noticed. [S351] For each advertisement, three scores are calculated:\n\n\n#### Day-after-recall tests (DARs)\n\nDay-after-recall (DAR) tests were developed by George Gallup in the 1940s and are still used. [S352] DAR tests provide a measure of the percentage of the people who recall something specific about an ad (e.g., sales message or a visual) the day following exposure. [S353] Interviewers ask questions designed to elicit:\n\n\n#### Tracking\n\nAd tracking or campaign tracking refers to techniques used to monitor the \"in-market performance\" of advertising. [S354] Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. [S355] Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured during and after the campaign has run. [S356] A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising *wear-out*. [S357] When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. [S358] Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. [S359] When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. [S360] One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use *repetition with variation* \u2013 that is, the use of different executions of the same message. [S361] Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign. [S362] #### Advertising return on investment (ROI)\n\nAdvertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. [S363] Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. [S364] Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty. [S365] ## Careers\n\nAdvertising management is a career path in the advertising or marketing industries. [S366] Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a public relations firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. [S367] In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as *account managers* and their role involves working closely with client firms. [S368] In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns.",

[S360] One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use *repetition with variation* \u2013 that is, the use of different executions of the same message. [S361] Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign. [S362] #### Advertising return on investment (ROI)\n\nAdvertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. [S363] Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. [S364] Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty. [S365] ## Careers\n\nAdvertising management is a career path in the advertising or marketing industries. [S366] Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a public relations firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. [S367] In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as *account managers* and their role involves working closely with client firms. [S368] In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the integration of advertising planning with marketing objectives, as outlined in the first passage, impacts the measurement of advertising ROI, and what role tracking methods play in this process according to the second passage.\n\nFirst, I need to look at Passage 1. The key part here is the section on \"Advertising planning.\" It says that advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives, and that the first step in advertising planning is to review the marketing plan's objectives. This ensures that promotional efforts align with corporate and marketing goals. So, integrating advertising with marketing objectives means that advertising is directly tied to broader goals, which would influence how ROI is measured because ROI metrics would need to reflect these aligned objectives.\n\nNow, looking at Passage 2, the section on \"Tracking\" mentions that ad tracking monitors in-market performance using pre-testing and post-testing. It also talks about avoiding wear-out through repetition with variation. The part about advertising ROI in Passage 2 states that good ROI measures should consider both short-term and long-term factors, mentioning online campaigns for sales and TV/PR for brand building. \n\nSo, the integration from Passage 1 affects ROI measurement by aligning advertising efforts with marketing goals, which would mean ROI metrics are tied to those goals. Tracking methods in Passage 2 help monitor campaign performance, adjust strategies to prevent wear-out, and ensure that both short-term and long-term ROI factors are addressed. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the integration part, Passage 1's [S137]-[S140] discuss advertising planning aligning with marketing objectives. For ROI impact, maybe [S139] mentions aligning with corporate goals. For tracking methods, Passage 2's [S354]-[S362] cover tracking techniques and their role in monitoring and adjusting campaigns, which affects ROI measurement."

[S322] There are many projective techniques including word association, sentence completion and story completion. [S323] These techniques assume that when exposed to incomplete stimuli, respondents use underlying attitudes or motivations to complete the storyline, thereby revealing their fears and aspirations that may not surface under more direct questioning. [S324] Projective techniques have been found to be very useful for evaluating concepts and generating new concepts. [S325] #### Physiological measures\n\nFor decades, researchers have been using physiological measures to study such responses to advertising. [S326] These measures include such things as pupil response, electrode mal response (GSR) and heart rate. [S327] These measures have been shown to be effective measures of attention and the strength of emotional response. [S328] With the rise of consumer neuroscience, researchers have begun to use a much wider range of measures to investigate cognitive responses as well as emotional responses. [S329] Some of the techniques used to measure consumer responses to advertising stimuli include:\n\n\n##### Pupil dilation\n\nThe amount of pupil dilation (also known as *pupillometry*) is believed to provide a relatively precise measure of the amount of mental effort associated with a task. [S330] Pupil dilation tests became a staple of advertising copy testing during the 1970s as a way to test consumers' responses to television commercials. [S331] Pupil dilation suggests a stronger interest in the stimuli and can be associated with arousal and action. [S332] Pupil dilation is not only used to study advertising, but also used to investigate product and package design. [S333] ##### Eye tracking\n\nWhile viewing an advertisement, a sensor aims a beam of infrared light at the eye and follows the movement to show the spot on which the viewer is focusing. [S334] This shows the length of time the viewer focuses on each element of the image and the general sequence used to interpret the image. [S335] Eye tracking is often used to fine tune advertising executions. [S336] Research studies suggest that eye tracking is associated with brand recognition, but less useful for brand recall. [S337] ##### Galvanic skin response (GSR)\n\nGalvanic skin response uses a device, called a galvanometer, which is very similar to a lie detector, designed to measure minute amounts of skin perspiration and electrical activity in the skin. [S338] Changes in skin response are associated with arousal and are an indicator of the advertisement's ability to capture attention. [S339] ##### Electroencephalograph (EEG)\n\nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) is a device that measures changes in brain-wave activity. [S340] EEG testing can detect emotional arousal which is difficult to detect using alternative testing methods. [S341] Arousal is an indicator of the advertisement's ability to grab attention and engage the consumer in the message. [S342] EEG testing is a cumbersome and invasive testing method which militates against routine use in advertising testing. [S343] ##### Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FmRI)\n\nFmRI is a technique that enables researchers to monitor activity in specific areas of the brain. [S344] This technique has been used to identify specific brain networks associated with pleasure and arousal associated with advertising. [S345] ### Post-testing\n\nThe aim of post-testing is to provide indicators of how well a given campaign is achieving the desired communications objectives, so that corrective action and fine-tuning can occur during the campaign as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising expenditure in order to provide benchmarks for future advertising programs. [S346] Techniques used in post-testing depend on the media employed, and may include such tests as Starch scores, day-after recall tests (DAR), campaign tracking, advertising ROI and other measures.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the availability of audience research data from Passage 1 supports the application of physiological measures in Passage 2 for advertising evaluation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both passages. Passage 1 talks about various metrics like site traffic, unique visitors, bounce rate, etc. It also mentions that some data is available to the public, while more detailed info is for subscribers. There's a table with sources for audience data in different countries. Then there's a section on media buying, discussing how advertisers usually work with agencies and the costs involved.\n\nPassage 2 discusses projective techniques and physiological measures. It lists methods like pupil dilation, eye tracking, GSR, EEG, and fMRI. These are used to measure responses to ads, like attention and emotional reactions. The passage explains each method's purpose and effectiveness.\n\nThe question is connecting the audience data from Passage 1 to the physiological measures in Passage 2. So, how does the data from Passage 1 support using physiological measures?\n\nLooking at Passage 1, the audience research data provides insights into user behavior, engagement metrics (like site stickiness, CTR, bounce rate), and sources of data. This data helps advertisers understand how audiences interact with media. If they know which ads have higher CTR or better engagement, they might use physiological measures to dig deeper into why those ads work. For example, if an ad has a high CTR, physiological measures could reveal what specific elements (like visuals or music) trigger that response.\n\nAlso, the availability of data from Passage 1 might help in validating the effectiveness of physiological measures. If certain metrics (like high engagement) correlate with physiological responses, it strengthens the case for using those measures. Additionally, media buying strategies mentioned in Passage 1 could benefit from physiological data to optimize ad placements, as knowing audience behavior can guide where and how to use these measures.\n\nBut I need to check the specific citations. The user wants citations from the passages. In Passage 1, the data on audience metrics and their availability is in sentences S282 to S284, S285, S286, etc. In Passage 2, the physiological measures are discussed in S321 to S345. \n\nSo, the support would be that audience data (from Passage 1) provides the baseline metrics (like CTR, engagement) which can be cross-referenced with physiological data (from Passage 2) to understand deeper consumer reactions. For example, high CTR (from Passage 1) might be linked to physiological arousal measured by GSR or EEG (Passage 2). The availability of audience data allows advertisers to target specific metrics, and then use physiological measures to validate or enhance their understanding.\n\nTherefore, the answer would link the audience metrics (from Passage 1) to the physiological measures (Passage 2) by showing how the data from Passage 1 informs where and how to apply the physiological tests, thereby supporting their application. Citations would be from both passages where these points are made."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S205] There are several approaches to using the competitive parity method:\n\nCompetitive parity requires a detailed understanding of competitor's expenditure in key areas. [S206] Market intelligence used to inform this approach can be obtained by consulting company annual reports and also from commercial research service providers such as Nielsen's AdEx. [S207] Other methods used to set advertising and promotional budgets include the *market share method*, *unit sales method*, *all available funds method*, *affordable method*, *marginal analysis* and others. [S208] Contemporary budgeting rarely relies on a single method, but instead uses a combination of methods to guide the marketer in determining the optimal expenditure levels. [S209] ### Devising the creative strategy\n\nThe creative strategy is also known as the *message strategy.* The creative strategy explains how the advertising campaign will address the advertising objectives. [S210] Developing the creative strategy typically begins by identifying the big idea (also known as the *creative concept* that will establish the intended product position in the minds of the customer. [S211] Another way of thinking about the creative concept is that it refers to the one thing that will make consumers respond. [S212] The creative concept should show how the product benefit meets the customer's needs or expectations in a unique way. [S213] Laskey et al. [S214] developed a typology of nine creative strategies. [S215] Initially devised for television, this typology has been widely adopted for other media including print media and social media. [S216] Laskey, Day and Crask's typology first identifies two broad classes of creative strategy:\n\n* Informational: rational appeals that typically provide information about the brand's benefits\n* Transformational: emotional appeals that assist consumers to imagine an aspirational lifestyle\n\nInformational appeals typically involve factual claims that list the product's benefits in a straightforward manner and are more likely to be used with high involvement goods. [S217] Transformational appeals play on emotions and are designed to transform the consumer's perceptions of themselves or of the product. [S218] Transformational appeals are more likely to be indicated for low-involvement goods or services. [S219] Emotional appeals are often known as a *soft-sell* approach. [S220] Because they bypass rational cognitive processing, transformational appeals are less likely to result in counter-arguing in the consumer's mind. [S221] Typology of Creative Strategies\n| **Informational** | **Description** | **Uses** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Comparative | Explicit comparison of brand and rival(s) | Use with care in competitive markets |\n| Unique Selling Proposition (USP) | Highlight a unique benefit that is meaningful to consumers | Use in categories with high levels of technological differentiation |\n| Pre-emptive | Be the first to use a common attribute or benefit | Use when differentiation is difficult or impossible |\n| Hyperbole | Gross exaggeration to highlight unique benefit | Use when brand has demonstrable point of difference |\n| Generic informational | Focus on product category | Use for new categories, new products or repositioning |\n| **Transformational** |\n| User Image | Focus on the consumer's lifestyles e.g. [S222] activities, interests, work |\n| Brand Image | Claim of superiority based on extrinsic factors such as customer perceptions, designed to give the brand a 'personality' | Use with low-tech goods where differentiation is difficult e.g. [S223] coolness, prestige |\n| Use Occasion | Focus on the brand experience, the ownership experience, the shopping experience or the consumption experience | Use with experiential goods where differentiation is difficult |\n| Generic | Focus on product class with emotional appeal | Use for new categories, new products or repositioning |\n\nPassage 2:\n[S7] The marketing and advertising literature has many different definitions of advertising, but it is possible to identify common elements or themes within most of these definitions. [S8] The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines advertising as \"the placement of announcements and persuasive messages in time or space purchased in any of the mass media by business firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and individuals who seek to inform and/ or persuade members of a particular target market or audience about their products, services, organizations, or ideas\". [S9] The *American Heritage Dictionary* defines advertising as \"the activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media\". [S10] Selected marketing scholars have defined advertising in the following terms: \"any non-personal communication that is paid for by an identified sponsor, and involves either mass communication viz newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other media (e.g., billboards, bus stop signage) or direct to-consumer communication via direct mail\". [S11] and \"the element of the marketing communications mix that is non-personal, paid for by an identified sponsor, and disseminated through mass channels of communication to promote the adoption of goods, services, persons, or ideas.\" One of the shortest definitions is that advertising is \"a paid, mass-mediated attempt to persuade\". [S12] Several common themes emerge in the various definitions of advertising:\n\n* Advertising is a *paid* form of communication and is therefore commercial. [S13] * Advertising employs *non-personal channels* (i.e. [S14] commercial mass media) which implies that it is directed at a mass audience rather than at an individual consumer and is a one-way communication mode where the sponsor sends messages, but recipients cannot respond or ask questions about the message content. [S15] * Advertising has an *identified sponsor*. [S16] In summary, given that advertising is paid, it is one of the many controllable elements in the marketing program. [S17] Advertising is qualitatively different from publicity where the message sponsor is either not identified or ambiguously defined, and different from personal selling which occurs in real-time and involves some face-to-face contact between the message sponsor and recipient allowing for two-way dialogue. [S18] While advertising refers to the advertising message, per se, advertising management refers to the process of planning and executing an advertising campaign or campaigns; that is, it is a series of planned decisions that begins with market research continues through to setting advertising budgets, developing advertising objectives, executing the creative messages and follows up with efforts to measure the extent to which objectives were achieved and evaluate the cost-benefit of the overall advertising effort. [S19] ## Advertising and organisational responsibilities\n\nIn commercial organisations, advertising, along with other marketing communications activities, is the ultimate responsibility of the marketing department. [S20] Some companies outsource part or all of the work to specialists such as advertising agencies, creative design teams, web designers, media buyers, events management specialists or other relevant service providers. [S21] Another option is for a company to carry out most or all of the advertising functions within the marketing department in what is known as an *in-house agency*. [S22] By definition, an in-house agency is \"an advertising organization that is owned and operated by the corporation it serves\". [S23] Its mission is to provide advertising services in support of its parent company's business and marketing objectives. [S24] Well-known brands that currently use in-house agencies include Google,\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Calvin Klein, Adobe, Dell, IBM, Kraft, Marriott and Wendy's.",

[S207] Other methods used to set advertising and promotional budgets include the *market share method*, *unit sales method*, *all available funds method*, *affordable method*, *marginal analysis* and others. [S208] Contemporary budgeting rarely relies on a single method, but instead uses a combination of methods to guide the marketer in determining the optimal expenditure levels. [S209] ### Devising the creative strategy\n\nThe creative strategy is also known as the *message strategy.* The creative strategy explains how the advertising campaign will address the advertising objectives. [S210] Developing the creative strategy typically begins by identifying the big idea (also known as the *creative concept* that will establish the intended product position in the minds of the customer. [S211] Another way of thinking about the creative concept is that it refers to the one thing that will make consumers respond. [S212] The creative concept should show how the product benefit meets the customer's needs or expectations in a unique way. [S213] Laskey et al. [S214] developed a typology of nine creative strategies. [S215] Initially devised for television, this typology has been widely adopted for other media including print media and social media. [S216] Laskey, Day and Crask's typology first identifies two broad classes of creative strategy:\n\n* Informational: rational appeals that typically provide information about the brand's benefits\n* Transformational: emotional appeals that assist consumers to imagine an aspirational lifestyle\n\nInformational appeals typically involve factual claims that list the product's benefits in a straightforward manner and are more likely to be used with high involvement goods. [S217] Transformational appeals play on emotions and are designed to transform the consumer's perceptions of themselves or of the product. [S218] Transformational appeals are more likely to be indicated for low-involvement goods or services. [S219] Emotional appeals are often known as a *soft-sell* approach. [S220] Because they bypass rational cognitive processing, transformational appeals are less likely to result in counter-arguing in the consumer's mind. [S221] Typology of Creative Strategies\n| **Informational** | **Description** | **Uses** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Comparative | Explicit comparison of brand and rival(s) | Use with care in competitive markets |\n| Unique Selling Proposition (USP) | Highlight a unique benefit that is meaningful to consumers | Use in categories with high levels of technological differentiation |\n| Pre-emptive | Be the first to use a common attribute or benefit | Use when differentiation is difficult or impossible |\n| Hyperbole | Gross exaggeration to highlight unique benefit | Use when brand has demonstrable point of difference |\n| Generic informational | Focus on product category | Use for new categories, new products or repositioning |\n| **Transformational** |\n| User Image | Focus on the consumer's lifestyles e.g. [S222] activities, interests, work |\n| Brand Image | Claim of superiority based on extrinsic factors such as customer perceptions, designed to give the brand a 'personality' | Use with low-tech goods where differentiation is difficult e.g. [S223] coolness, prestige |\n| Use Occasion | Focus on the brand experience, the ownership experience, the shopping experience or the consumption experience | Use with experiential goods where differentiation is difficult |\n| Generic | Focus on product class with emotional appeal | Use for new categories, new products or repositioning |",
        "[S7] The marketing and advertising literature has many different definitions of advertising, but it is possible to identify common elements or themes within most of these definitions. [S8] The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines advertising as \"the placement of announcements and persuasive messages in time or space purchased in any of the mass media by business firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and individuals who seek to inform and/ or persuade members of a particular target market or audience about their products, services, organizations, or ideas\". [S9] The *American Heritage Dictionary* defines advertising as \"the activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media\". [S10] Selected marketing scholars have defined advertising in the following terms: \"any non-personal communication that is paid for by an identified sponsor, and involves either mass communication viz newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other media (e.g., billboards, bus stop signage) or direct to-consumer communication via direct mail\". [S11] and \"the element of the marketing communications mix that is non-personal, paid for by an identified sponsor, and disseminated through mass channels of communication to promote the adoption of goods, services, persons, or ideas.\" One of the shortest definitions is that advertising is \"a paid, mass-mediated attempt to persuade\". [S12] Several common themes emerge in the various definitions of advertising:\n\n* Advertising is a *paid* form of communication and is therefore commercial. [S13] * Advertising employs *non-personal channels* (i.e. [S14] commercial mass media) which implies that it is directed at a mass audience rather than at an individual consumer and is a one-way communication mode where the sponsor sends messages, but recipients cannot respond or ask questions about the message content. [S15] * Advertising has an *identified sponsor*. [S16] In summary, given that advertising is paid, it is one of the many controllable elements in the marketing program. [S17] Advertising is qualitatively different from publicity where the message sponsor is either not identified or ambiguously defined, and different from personal selling which occurs in real-time and involves some face-to-face contact between the message sponsor and recipient allowing for two-way dialogue. [S18] While advertising refers to the advertising message, per se, advertising management refers to the process of planning and executing an advertising campaign or campaigns; that is, it is a series of planned decisions that begins with market research continues through to setting advertising budgets, developing advertising objectives, executing the creative messages and follows up with efforts to measure the extent to which objectives were achieved and evaluate the cost-benefit of the overall advertising effort. [S19] ## Advertising and organisational responsibilities\n\nIn commercial organisations, advertising, along with other marketing communications activities, is the ultimate responsibility of the marketing department. [S20] Some companies outsource part or all of the work to specialists such as advertising agencies, creative design teams, web designers, media buyers, events management specialists or other relevant service providers. [S21] Another option is for a company to carry out most or all of the advertising functions within the marketing department in what is known as an *in-house agency*. [S22] By definition, an in-house agency is \"an advertising organization that is owned and operated by the corporation it serves\". [S23] Its mission is to provide advertising services in support of its parent company's business and marketing objectives. [S24] Well-known brands that currently use in-house agencies include Google,\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Calvin Klein, Adobe, Dell, IBM, Kraft, Marriott and Wendy's."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the competitive parity method in advertising budgeting relates to the overall process of advertising management as described in the source, and what role the creative strategy plays in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions competitive parity in S205 to S209. It says that competitive parity requires understanding competitors' expenditures and that modern budgeting uses a combination of methods. The overall advertising management process is discussed in Passage 2, specifically S19, which describes advertising management as the process of planning and executing campaigns, including market research, setting budgets, objectives, creating messages, and evaluating effectiveness.\n\nSo, the competitive parity method is part of the budgeting phase within advertising management. The source states that contemporary budgeting uses multiple methods, including competitive parity, to determine optimal expenditure. That connects competitive parity to the broader process of advertising management.\n\nNext, the creative strategy's role. The passage under \"Devising the creative strategy\" (S209-S223) explains that the creative strategy (or message strategy) addresses advertising objectives. It involves developing a creative concept that meets customer needs uniquely. The typology of strategies (informational vs. transformational) is part of this creative strategy. So, the creative strategy is a key component in executing the advertising campaign, directly tied to achieving the objectives set during the planning phase.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. For the competitive parity relation to advertising management, S205-S209 and S19 are relevant. For the creative strategy, S209-S223, especially S209 which introduces the creative strategy's role. Also, the typology in S214-S223 supports the role of creative strategy.\n\nNow, structuring the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its own <statement> and <cite> tags. Need to ensure that each citation is correctly numbered and that the statements accurately reflect the source material."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S115] *Quadrant 2*: High-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the second quadrant, audiences exhibit an emotional response to advertisements which transfers to products. [S116] This approach is used for products such as jewellery, expensive perfumes and designer fashion where consumers are emotionally involved in the purchase. [S117] When this mode of purchasing is evident, advertising should be designed to create a strong brand image and media should be selected to support the relevant image. [S118] For example, magazines such as *Vogue* can help to create an up-market image. [S119] *Quadrant 3*: Low-involvement/ rational purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident for many packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. [S120] Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption the benefit of using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). [S121] Given that this is a rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. [S122] Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy should be weighted towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion. [S123] *Quadrant 4*: Low-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the final quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases that make them feel good. [S124] Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. [S125] The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. [S126] When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should \"congratulate\" customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they are close to the point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays. [S127] Examples of this approach include \"McDonald's \u2013 You Deserve a Break Today\" and \"L'Oreal- Because You're Worth It\". [S128] ### Hierarchy-free models\n\nMany authors have treated reason (rational processes) and emotion (affective processes) as entirely independent. [S129] Yet, other researchers have argued that both reason and emotion can be employed simultaneously, to process advertising information. [S130] Hierarchy-free models draw on evidence from psychology and consumer neuroscience which suggest that consumers process information via different pathways rather than in any linear/ sequential manner. [S131] Thus, hierarchy-free models do not employ any fixed processing sequence. [S132] These models treat advertising as part of the brand totality. [S133] Some hierarchy-free models treat brands as 'myth' and advertising as 'myth-making' while other models seek to tap into the consumer's memories of pleasant consumption experiences (e.g. [S134] the MAC- Memory-Affect-Cognition model). [S135] Hierarchy-free models are of increasing interest to academics and practitioners because they are more customer-centric and allow for the possibility of consumer co-creation of value. [S136] ## Advertising planning\n\nAdvertising planning does not occur in a vacuum. [S137] Advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives. [S138] Therefore, the first step in any advertising planning is to review to the objectives as set out in the marketing plan. [S139] This is designed to ensure that all promotional efforts, including advertising, are working towards achieving both short-term and long-term corporate and marketing goals and align with the company's values and vision. [S140] ### Review the marketing plan\n\nA review of the marketing plan can be a relatively simple process, or it can involve a formal review, known as an *audit*. [S141] The review or audit might consider such issues as prior marketing communications activity, an evaluation of what has been effective in the past, whether new market research studies are warranted, an outline of competitive advertising activity and a review of budgetary considerations.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S348] Starch scores were developed by Daniel Starch in the 1920s to evaluate the copy effectiveness of print advertisements and are still in use today. [S349] A consumer is shown a magazine page by page and subsequently asked whether they had noticed any part an advertisement. [S350] If they answer, 'Yes', the interviewer asks the respondent to indicate which parts of the ad were noticed. [S351] For each advertisement, three scores are calculated:\n\n\n#### Day-after-recall tests (DARs)\n\nDay-after-recall (DAR) tests were developed by George Gallup in the 1940s and are still used. [S352] DAR tests provide a measure of the percentage of the people who recall something specific about an ad (e.g., sales message or a visual) the day following exposure. [S353] Interviewers ask questions designed to elicit:\n\n\n#### Tracking\n\nAd tracking or campaign tracking refers to techniques used to monitor the \"in-market performance\" of advertising. [S354] Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. [S355] Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured during and after the campaign has run. [S356] A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising *wear-out*. [S357] When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. [S358] Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. [S359] When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. [S360] One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use *repetition with variation* \u2013 that is, the use of different executions of the same message. [S361] Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign. [S362] #### Advertising return on investment (ROI)\n\nAdvertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. [S363] Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. [S364] Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty. [S365] ## Careers\n\nAdvertising management is a career path in the advertising or marketing industries. [S366] Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a public relations firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. [S367] In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as *account managers* and their role involves working closely with client firms. [S368] In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the different quadrants of consumer purchasing behavior (high/low involvement and emotional/rational) influence media strategies and advertising objectives, and how these relate to evaluation methods like Starch scores and day-after-recall tests from the second passage.\n\nFirst, I need to look at Passage 1 to understand the quadrants. There are four quadrants mentioned: High-involvement/emotional (Quadrant 2), Low-involvement/rational (Quadrant 3), Low-involvement/emotional (Quadrant 4), and the fourth one isn't explicitly named but maybe Quadrant 1? Wait, the passage starts with Quadrant 2, so maybe the numbering is off. Anyway, the key points are:\n\n- Quadrant 2 (High-involvement/emotional): Emphasizes brand image, media like Vogue to maintain an up-market image. So media strategy here is about image, maybe more premium channels.\n- Quadrant 3 (Low-involvement/rational): Focus on reminder campaigns, high frequency media like TV, radio, sales promotions. The goal is to reinforce brand loyalty through repetition.\n- Quadrant 4 (Low-involvement/emotional): Impulse purchases, media near point-of-purchase like billboards, sales promotions. Ad messages are about congrats, so maybe more immediate, emotional triggers.\n\nThen, the question also asks about the relation to Starch scores and day-after-recall tests. Looking at Passage 2, Starch scores evaluate ad effectiveness by measuring if people noticed parts of the ad. DAR tests check recall the next day. How do these relate to the quadrants?\n\nFor example, in Quadrant 2, if the ad is about creating a strong brand image (like in Vogue), Starch scores would measure if the ad was noticed. But since it's high-involvement, maybe the ad needs to be more engaging. For Quadrant 3, with low-involvement rational purchases, the ads are reminders. Starch scores might not be as important as DAR tests, which measure recall of the message. For Quadrant 4, where the ads are about immediate satisfaction, maybe DAR tests would show if the message was remembered, but also the media placement (like billboards) would be tested for effectiveness.\n\nI need to connect each quadrant's media strategy and objectives to the evaluation methods. For instance, high-involvement/emotional (Quadrant 2) might use Starch scores to ensure the ad is noticed and has a strong image, while day-after-recall would check if the emotional message is remembered. For low-involvement/rational (Quadrant 3), the focus is on repetition, so DAR tests would track if the message is recalled, and maybe Starch scores aren't as critical. For low-involvement/emotional (Quadrant 4), the media is near the point of purchase, so maybe Starch scores are used to ensure the ad is noticed, and DAR tests check if the emotional trigger is remembered.\n\nI should check the citations in the passage. For example, in Passage 1, the media strategies are mentioned in S117 (Quadrant 2), S122 (Quadrant 3), S126 (Quadrant 4). The evaluation methods are in Passage 2, S348-S351 for Starch scores, S352-S353 for DAR. The question is how these relate. So, the answer would link each quadrant's media strategy to the evaluation methods. For example, high-involvement ads (Quadrant 2) need to be noticed (Starch) and remembered (DAR), while low-involvement rational (Quadrant 3) might focus more on recall (DAR) for repetition. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. For instance, when talking about Quadrant 2's media strategy, cite S117, S118. For Starch scores, cite S348-S351. For DAR, S352-S353. Also, the hierarchy-free models in Passage 1 might not be directly relevant here, but the question is about the quadrants and their relation to evaluation methods. So focus on the quadrants and the evaluation methods mentioned in Passage 2."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S25] Both in-house agencies and outsourcing models have their own advantages and disadvantages. [S26] Outsourcing to an external agency allows marketers to obtain highly specialised strategic, research and planning skills, access to top creative talent and provides an independent perspective on marketing or advertising problems. [S27] In-house agencies deliver cost advantages, time efficiencies and afford marketers greater control over the advertising effort. [S28] In addition, personnel who work within an in-house agency gain considerable creative experience which stays within the company. [S29] Recent trends suggest that the number of in-house agencies is rising. [S30] Whether a company chooses to outsource advertising functions to an external agency or carry them out within the marketing department, marketers need a rich understanding of advertising principles in order to prepare effective advertising plans, brief relevant agencies about their needs and expectations or develop their own creative solutions to marketing problems. [S31] ## Advertising's role in the promotional mix\n\nThe promotional mix is the specific combination of promotional methods used for a brand, product or family of products. [S32] Advertising is best treated as a *multiplier* that can leverage other elements of the promotional mix and marketing program. [S33] Therefore, advertising must be considered as part of a broader marketing and promotional program. [S34] The promotional mix includes a variety of tools such as:\n\nAdvertising is just one of many elements that comprise the promotional mix. [S35] When marketers communicate with target markets across a broad range of different promotional types and media, the potential for contradictory or mixed messages is very real. [S36] Accordingly, it is important that advertising is treated as part of a total marketing communications program and that steps are taken to ensure that it is integrated with all other marketing communications, so that all communications messages speak with a 'single voice'. [S37] The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as *integrated marketing communications*. [S38] Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. [S39] For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. [S40] Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. [S41] The \"right\" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency. [S42] In addition, decision-makers need to recognise that consumers rely on different information sources at different stages of the purchase decision process. [S43] Therefore, advertising and other elements of the promotional campaign must be integrated to ensure that consumers receive the right messages via the right channels at the right time, depending on the consumer's readiness to buy. [S44] In terms of integrated communications, the literature identifies different types of integration: (1) *Image integration* refers to messages that have a consistent look and feel, regardless of the medium; (2) *Functional integration* refers to capacity of different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message; (3) *Coordinated integration* refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. [S45] web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants) coordinate to provide a consistent message; (4) *Stakeholder integration* refers to the way that all stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers and others cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values and (5) *Relationship integration* refers to the way that communications professionals contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S46] On the surface, integrated marketing communications appear to be simple common sense. [S47] Yet, a survey of brand advertisers carried out by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) revealed that while 67 per cent of marketers engage in integrated marketing communications, just one third are satisfied with their efforts.

[S51] Noting the difficulties in explaining how advertising works, one theorist wrote, \"Only the brave or ignorant...can say exactly what advertising does in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe advertising and marketing literature suggests a variety of different models to explain how advertising works. [S52] These models are not competing theories, but rather explanations of how advertising persuades or influences different types of consumers in different purchase contexts. [S53] In a seminal paper, Vankratsas and Ambler surveyed more than 250 papers to develop a typology of advertising models. [S54] They identified four broad classes of model: *cognitive information models*, *pure affect models*, *hierarchy of effect models*, *integrative models* and *hierarchy-free models*. [S55] ### Cognitive information models\n\nAdvertising researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding both the degree and type of cognitive elaboration that occurs when consumers are exposed to persuasive messages. [S56] Cognitive information models assume that consumers are rational decision-makers, and that advertising provides consumers with information utility by reducing the need to search for other information about a brand. [S57] For example, an advertisement in the *Yellow Pages* or an online directory means that the consumer does not have to travel from store to store in search of a product or service. [S58] Consumers process this information at a cognitive level before forming an attitude to the brand and purchase intent. [S59] A cognition is any thought that surfaces during the elaboration of the information. [S60] Cognitive information models are also known as the *central route to persuasion*. [S61] A common theme in cognitive information models is that the net favourability of cognitive responses has a direct influence on attitude strength. [S62] In the cognitive information models, the general path to persuasion is as follows:\n\nTheoretical works, combined with empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products). [S63] Research studies also suggest that consumers who are involved in the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level. [S64] ### Pure affect models\n\nPure affect models suggest that consumers shape their preferences to a brand based on the feelings and attitudes elicited by exposure to an advertising message. [S65] When consumers view an advertisement, they not only develop attitudes towards the advertisement and the advertiser, but also develop feelings and beliefs about the brand being advertised.",

[S37] The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as *integrated marketing communications*. [S38] Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. [S39] For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. [S40] Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. [S41] The \"right\" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of advertising in the promotional mix and how theories of advertising effects address message consistency challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage. The promotional mix is discussed in Passage 1. The key points there are that advertising is a multiplier that leverages other elements, must be part of a broader program, and integrated marketing communications (IMC) ensures message consistency. Sentences S32, S33, S36, S37, and S41 mention advertising's role and the need for integration. \n\nFor the second part about theories of advertising effects, Passage 2 talks about the challenges in integrating messages and the models like cognitive information, pure affect, etc. The theories address message consistency by explaining different consumer responses, but the passage doesn't explicitly link them to solving consistency issues. However, the IMC concepts in Passage 1 do mention integrated marketing communications as the process for consistency. \n\nWait, the question is how the theories address the challenges. The passage mentions that theories explain different consumer responses but doesn't directly say they address consistency. The IMC part is more about the process. So maybe the answer is that advertising's role is as a multiplier and part of IMC, and the theories don't directly address consistency but explain consumer behavior. But the user might expect that the theories help in creating consistent messages. Hmm.\n\nI need to check the citations. For the role of advertising, S32, S33, S36, S37, S41. For the theories part, S48 mentions the difficulty in integration, and the theories are about how advertising works, but not directly about consistency. The answer should state that theories explain different consumer responses but the challenge of consistency is addressed through IMC. So the theories might not directly address it, but the IMC process does. So the answer would combine both parts, citing the relevant sentences."

Examples include reducing the need for search (S57, S58). It also mentions that cognitive models are the central route to persuasion (S61) and that they focus on cognitive responses affecting attitude strength (S62). The effectiveness here depends on the information provided and the consumer's involvement level (S64).\n\nFor pure affect models, the context states that these models focus on emotions and feelings elicited by ads.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S166] The communications objectives will, at least in part, depend on whether the marketer is using a push or pull strategy. [S167] In a *push strategy*, the marketer advertises intensively with retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. [S168] In contrast, in a *pull strategy*, the marketer advertises directly to consumers hoping that they will put pressure on retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. [S169] In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer-oriented advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio. [S170] ### Devising advertising objectives\n\nSetting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan. [S171] Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated. [S172] Advertising objectives should be **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable and **T**ime-dependent (SMART).\u1da0\u1d43\u2071\u02e1\u1d49\u1d48 \u1d5b\u1d49\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks \u2013 that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated. [S173] One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach (**D**efining **A**dvertising **G**oals for **M**easured **A**dvertising **R**esults) developed in the 1960s. [S174] While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects. [S175] In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. [S176] Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:\n\nManagerial Options for Communications Objectives\n| Target Consumer's State of Mind | Communication/ Advertising Objective | Advertising Message Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category Need** * Category need already present * Latent category need * No or weak category need | * Omit category need as an objective of advertising or promotion * Mention category need to remind customer of previously established need * \"Sell\" category need using positive or negative motivations (e.g. [S177] pain removal, pain avoidance, dissatisfaction, sensory gratification, social approval) | *Pain avoidance*: \"For fast, sure pain relief, Anacin\" |\n| **Brand Awareness** * *Brand recall* * *Brand recognition* | * Use taglines, slogans, jingles to teach brand recall and strengthen learning * Associate brand name with category * Show product packaging or label in all advertising | *Paired category-brand association*: \"When you think of chocolate, think of Cadbury\" |\n| **Brand Preference** * Negative preference * Unaware * Moderate preference * Strong preference | * Change to moderate preference * Create strong preference * Increase preference * Reinforce strong preference | *Brand Preference*: \"The burgers are better at Burger King (or Hungry Jack's)\" |\n| **Purchase Intention** * Low-involvement decision * High-involvement decision | * Omit purchase-intention * Generate purchase-intention | *Purchase-intention*: \"Hurry, hurry last days, offer must expire soon\"; \"Don't wait- limited stocks available\" |\n| **Purchase Facilitation** * Customer knows where to purchase product or service and how much to pay for it * Not obvious where to purchase or how to find retailer | * Omit purchase-facilitation * Incorporate purchase-facilitation in all marketing communications | *Purchase-facilitation*: \"Refer to website for nearest stockist\" |\n\nPassage 2:\n[S66] Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. [S67] These models suggest that simple exposure to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention. [S68] Exposure in the form of advertising messages leads to an attitude to the advertisement (A\u2090d) which transfers to the attitude to the brand (Ab) without any further cognitive processing. [S69] Exposure it not restricted to physical contact; rather it can refer to any brand-related contact such as advertising, promotion or virtual brands on websites. [S70] In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:\n\nThis path is also known as the *peripheral route to persuasion*. [S71] Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. [S72] In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising). [S73] ### Hierarchy of effects models\n\nHierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. [S74] The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. [S75] A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, DAGMAR and AIDA and other variants. [S76] Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory, and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied. [S77] The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from brand awareness through to action (purchase and consumption). [S78] As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects, they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. [S79] Thus, the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence. [S80] The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:\n\nThe literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. [S81] The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models. [S82] Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour. [S83] Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits. [S84] Selected hierarchical models follow:\n\nAll hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. [S85] The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as *conversion.* While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale. [S86] Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms, guarantees or a strong call-to-action as part of the advertising message.",

The user is asking about the key considerations for setting SMART advertising objectives and how communication effects like brand preference and purchase intention, along with the DAGMAR approach's shortcomings, influence the evaluation of advertising effectiveness.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passages. The first passage mentions SMART objectives in sentences S170-S172. It says that objectives should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, and Time-dependent. Also, they need measurement benchmarks. So that's part of the answer.\n\nThen, the DAGMAR approach is discussed in S173-S175. The passage states that DAGMAR fails to link objectives with communication effects. That's a key point about its shortcomings. \n\nNext, the communication effects: the passage lists five effects from Rossiter and Bellman. The table in the passage includes brand preference and purchase intention as two of them. The key considerations here would be these effects, so I need to cite the relevant sentences. The table is in S176-S177, but the specific mention of brand preference and purchase intention is in the table's rows. However, the exact sentences might be S176, which mentions Rossiter and Bellman's five effects. \n\nThe question also asks how these communication effects and DAGMAR's shortcomings influence the evaluation. The passage says that linking objectives to communication effects is important (S175), and DAGMAR's failure to do that is a problem. So the evaluation would need to consider these effects, which DAGMAR doesn't address properly.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements and citations. Each sentence should have its citations. Let me check each part again.\n\nFor SMART objectives: S170 (setting objectives provides framework), S171 (specify what's to be achieved), S172 (include measurement benchmarks), and S173 (SMART acronym with failed verification). Wait, the note about SMART in S172 says \"SMART.\u1da0\u1d43\u2071\u02e1\u1d49\u1d48 \u1d5b\u1d49\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f\" which might be a typo, but the key point is the definition.\n\nFor communication effects: The table in S176 lists the five effects, including brand preference and purchase intention. So the mention of these effects would be in S176. Also, the DAGMAR shortcomings are in S174 and S175.\n\nSo the answer should have statements about SMART considerations, the communication effects (brand preference, purchase intention), and DAGMAR's shortcomings.

[S181] ### Setting advertising budgets\n\nA firm's advertising budget is a sub-set of its overall budget. [S182] For many firms, the cost of advertising is one of the largest expenses, second only to wages and salaries. [S183] Advertising expenditure varies enormously according to firm size, market coverage, managerial expectations and even managerial style. [S184] Procter and Gamble, the top US advertiser, spent US$4.3 billion in 2015 on national media (exclusive of agency fees and production costs) while a small local advertiser might spend just a few thousand dollars in the same period. [S185] The size of the budget has implications for the promotional mix, the media mix and market coverage. [S186] As a generalisation, very large budgets are required to sustain national television campaigns. [S187] Advertisers with tight budgets may forced to use less effective media alternatives. [S188] However, even advertisers with small budgets may be able to incorporate expensive main media, by focusing on narrow geographic markets, buying spots in non-peak time periods and carefully managing advertising schedules. [S189] A number of different methods are used to develop the advertising (and/or marketing communications) budget. [S190] The most commonly used methods are: percentage-of-sales, objective and task, competitive parity method, market share method, unit sales method, all available funds method and the affordable method. [S191] #### Percentage-of-sales method\n\nUsing the percentage-of-sales method, the advertiser allocates a fixed percentage (say 5% or 10%) of forecast sales value to the advertising budget. [S192] This method is predicated on the assumption that advertising causes future sales volume. [S193] The percentage of sales method is the easiest method to use and for this reason remains one of the most widely used methods for setting budgets. [S194] A major problem with the\u00a0%-of-sales method is that there is no consensus about the percentage value to apply. [S195] Some companies use industry averages as a guide to set their marcomms budget. [S196] The following table, based on industry averages, shows that the\u00a0% value can vary from around 20% of sales to less than 1 percent. [S197] Ad-to-sales ratios for selected industries, 2004\n| Industry | Ad-to-sales ratio |\n| --- | --- |\n| Health services | 18.7 |\n| Transportation services | 14.2 |\n| Motion pictures and videotape production | 13.7 |\n| Food | 11.9 |\n| Computer & office equipment | 11.9 |\n| Computer & software wholesale | 0.2 |\n\n\n#### Objective and task method\n\nThe objective and task method is the most rational and defensible of all budgeting methods. [S198] In this method, the advertiser determines the advertising objectives and then defines specific, measurable communication tasks that will need to be undertaken to achieve the desired objectives. [S199] Cost estimates are developed for each communication task in order to arrive at a total budget estimate. [S200] This method is time-consuming and complex, and as a consequence has been less widely used in practice, however, recent research suggests that more marketers are taking up this approach. [S201] #### Competitive parity method\n\nThe competitive parity method allocates the advertising or promotional budget based on competitive spending for comparable activities. [S202] This approach is a defensive strategy used to protect a brand market position. [S203] It assumes that rival firms have similar objectives and is widely used in highly competitive markets. [S204] The main criticism of this method is that it assumes competitors know what they are doing in relation to advertising expenditure.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S224] In addition to determining the overall creative strategy, the advertiser also needs to consider the creative execution \u2013 which refers to the way that the message is presented. [S225] Examples of creative execution include: problem-solution formats, fear appeals, sex appeals, humour, parody, slogans or jingles, mnemonics, slice-of-life, guarantee, celebrity endorsement, testimonial, news style, scientific appeals, dramatisation and product demonstration. [S226] ### Media planning\n\nStrategic media planning consists of four key decision areas:\n\nThe traditional approach to media strategy was primarily concerned with setting objectives for message reach, weight and frequency. [S227] The contemporary approach, however, often treats the media strategy as an extension of the creative strategy. [S228] For example, L'Oreal Men's Expert promoted its skincare range on dry-cleaner hangers. [S229] When customers picked up their shirt, they found a $2 coupon and a message, \"Your shirt doesn't come with wrinkles, why should your face?\" This novel execution shows how media and creative can be integrated to generate powerful advertising. [S230] #### Setting media objectives\n\nIn terms of setting media objectives, the planner needs to address several key decisions:\n\n* Who do we want to talk to? [S231] (Target market/ audience definition)\n* How often does an audience member need to hear our message before it is noticed or achieves the desired consumer response? [S232] (Effective frequency)\n* When do audiences cease to notice the ad, or become tired of seeing the ad? [S233] (Advertising wear-out)\n\nA number of key definitions are essential for media planning purposes:\n\nWith respect to reach objectives, planners must decide what proportion of the target market need to be exposed to the advertising message. [S234] It is not always necessary to reach 100% of the target market. [S235] For new brands or brands with very low levels of awareness, it may be desirable to reach every member of the target market. [S236] However, for reminder type campaigns lower levels of reach may be all that is required. [S237] Reach objectives are normally framed in terms of a percentage of market. [S238] For example, a reach objective might read; *To reach 50% of women aged 18\u201325 years.*\n\nWith respect to frequency objectives, the planner must determine the optimal level of frequency in order to achieve the desired communications objective. [S239] Media planners often work with rules of thumb for setting frequency objectives that are based on an extensive body of evidence drawn from research findings. [S240] For example, empirical evidence suggests that the average consumer needs to be exposed to a message at least three times before they become aware of the brand information. [S241] This is sometimes known as the *3+ Rule*. [S242] To this basic benchmark of three exposures, media planners recognise that to achieve higher-level communication goals, such as persuasion and lead generation, higher levels of frequency are required. [S243] To achieve simple brand awareness, three exposures may be sufficient, but for consumers to act on that awareness, higher levels of exposure may be required. [S244] Some theorists have developed sophisticated decision models to assist with planning optimal frequency levels. [S245] Planners also need to consider the combined effects of reach and frequency (GRPs). [S246] In an intensive campaign, the schedule will utilise both broad reach (expose more people to the message) and high frequency (expose people multiple times to the message). [S247] The overall campaign weight has implications for budgets and for media selection. [S248] In an intensive campaign (heavy weight campaign), the media strategy is normally skewed towards main media, which remains the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create stable brand awareness levels. [S249] #### Media channel strategy\n\nThe first channel decision that needs to be made is whether to use a *concentrated* channel strategy or a *dispersion* channel strategy:",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how different advertising budgeting methods like percentage-of-sales and objective-and-task approaches influence media strategy and market coverage, and the trade-offs between them as per the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context carefully. The passage mentions several budgeting methods, including percentage-of-sales and objective-and-task. Let me find the relevant sections.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, there's a section on the percentage-of-sales method. It says that this method allocates a fixed percentage of forecast sales to the advertising budget, assuming advertising causes sales. However, there's no consensus on the percentage, and the example table shows varying ratios. The trade-off here might be that it's easy to use but lacks a clear percentage, which could lead to under or over-allocation.\n\nThen, the objective-and-task method is discussed. It's described as the most rational, where objectives are set first, then tasks and costs. It's time-consuming but more precise. The trade-off here is that it's complex and less used, but more effective. \n\nNow, how do these methods influence media strategy and market coverage? The passage mentions that budget size affects the media mix and market coverage. For example, large budgets can sustain national TV campaigns, while small budgets might use narrow markets or off-peak times. The percentage-of-sales method's variability in percentage could lead to inconsistent media strategies. The objective-and-task method, being more precise, might allow for a more tailored media strategy aligned with specific objectives, but requires more resources.\n\nThe trade-offs would involve the ease of use vs. effectiveness. Percentage-of-sales is simple but might not align well with actual needs, while objective-and-task is thorough but resource-intensive. Also, the competitive parity method is mentioned as a defensive strategy, but that's not part of the question.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For percentage-of-sales, S191, S192, S194, S195, S196, S197. For objective-and-task, S198, S199, S200, S201. The influence on media strategy is in S185, S186, S187, S188. The trade-offs are covered in S194, S195, S200, S201.\n\nI should structure the answer by first explaining each method's influence, then the trade-offs, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations."

[S26] Outsourcing to an external agency allows marketers to obtain highly specialised strategic, research and planning skills, access to top creative talent and provides an independent perspective on marketing or advertising problems. [S27] In-house agencies deliver cost advantages, time efficiencies and afford marketers greater control over the advertising effort. [S28] In addition, personnel who work within an in-house agency gain considerable creative experience which stays within the company. [S29] Recent trends suggest that the number of in-house agencies is rising. [S30] Whether a company chooses to outsource advertising functions to an external agency or carry them out within the marketing department, marketers need a rich understanding of advertising principles in order to prepare effective advertising plans, brief relevant agencies about their needs and expectations or develop their own creative solutions to marketing problems. [S31] ## Advertising's role in the promotional mix\n\nThe promotional mix is the specific combination of promotional methods used for a brand, product or family of products. [S32] Advertising is best treated as a *multiplier* that can leverage other elements of the promotional mix and marketing program. [S33] Therefore, advertising must be considered as part of a broader marketing and promotional program. [S34] The promotional mix includes a variety of tools such as:\n\nAdvertising is just one of many elements that comprise the promotional mix. [S35] When marketers communicate with target markets across a broad range of different promotional types and media, the potential for contradictory or mixed messages is very real. [S36] Accordingly, it is important that advertising is treated as part of a total marketing communications program and that steps are taken to ensure that it is integrated with all other marketing communications, so that all communications messages speak with a 'single voice'. [S37] The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as *integrated marketing communications*. [S38] Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. [S39] For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. [S40] Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. [S41] The \"right\" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency. [S42] In addition, decision-makers need to recognise that consumers rely on different information sources at different stages of the purchase decision process. [S43] Therefore, advertising and other elements of the promotional campaign must be integrated to ensure that consumers receive the right messages via the right channels at the right time, depending on the consumer's readiness to buy. [S44] In terms of integrated communications, the literature identifies different types of integration: (1) *Image integration* refers to messages that have a consistent look and feel, regardless of the medium; (2) *Functional integration* refers to capacity of different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message; (3) *Coordinated integration* refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. [S45] web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants) coordinate to provide a consistent message; (4) *Stakeholder integration* refers to the way that all stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers and others cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values and (5) *Relationship integration* refers to the way that communications professionals contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S46] On the surface, integrated marketing communications appear to be simple common sense. [S47] Yet, a survey of brand advertisers carried out by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) revealed that while 67 per cent of marketers engage in integrated marketing communications, just one third are satisfied with their efforts. [S48] In practice, integrating communications messages across a broad range of promotional formats and media channels is very difficult to achieve. [S49] ## Theories of advertising effects\n\nStudies have repeatedly demonstrated a clear association between advertising and sales response. [S50] Yet the exact process that leads from the consumer of being exposed to an advertising message through to a purchase or behavioral response is not entirely clear. [S51] Noting the difficulties in explaining how advertising works, one theorist wrote, \"Only the brave or ignorant...can say exactly what advertising does in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe advertising and marketing literature suggests a variety of different models to explain how advertising works. [S52] These models are not competing theories, but rather explanations of how advertising persuades or influences different types of consumers in different purchase contexts. [S53] In a seminal paper, Vankratsas and Ambler surveyed more than 250 papers to develop a typology of advertising models. [S54] They identified four broad classes of model: *cognitive information models*, *pure affect models*, *hierarchy of effect models*, *integrative models* and *hierarchy-free models*. [S55] ### Cognitive information models\n\nAdvertising researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding both the degree and type of cognitive elaboration that occurs when consumers are exposed to persuasive messages. [S56] Cognitive information models assume that consumers are rational decision-makers, and that advertising provides consumers with information utility by reducing the need to search for other information about a brand. [S57] For example, an advertisement in the *Yellow Pages* or an online directory means that the consumer does not have to travel from store to store in search of a product or service. [S58] Consumers process this information at a cognitive level before forming an attitude to the brand and purchase intent. [S59] A cognition is any thought that surfaces during the elaboration of the information. [S60] Cognitive information models are also known as the *central route to persuasion*. [S61] A common theme in cognitive information models is that the net favourability of cognitive responses has a direct influence on attitude strength. [S62] In the cognitive information models, the general path to persuasion is as follows:\n\nTheoretical works, combined with empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products). [S63] Research studies also suggest that consumers who are involved in the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level. [S64] ### Pure affect models\n\nPure affect models suggest that consumers shape their preferences to a brand based on the feelings and attitudes elicited by exposure to an advertising message. [S65] When consumers view an advertisement, they not only develop attitudes towards the advertisement and the advertiser, but also develop feelings and beliefs about the brand being advertised.",

I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll check the sections about in-house agencies. From the supporting context, Passage 1 has several sentences. Sentence [S25] mentions that both in-house and outsourcing have their own pros and cons. [S27] says in-house agencies offer cost advantages, time efficiencies, and more control. [S28] adds that in-house staff gain creative experience. Then, [S30] states that regardless of in-house or outsourcing, marketers need a good understanding of advertising principles to create effective plans.\n\nNow, for IMC challenges. In Passage 1, [S36] talks about the risk of mixed messages when using multiple promotional types. [S37] defines IMC as ensuring message consistency. [S48] mentions that integrating messages across media is difficult. [S49] is a section heading about IMC challenges. Also, [S44] discusses the need for integration to ensure right messages at the right time. [S45] mentions different types of integration like image, functional, etc.\n\nSo, the advantages of in-house agencies (cost, control, experience) can help in maintaining consistent messaging (part of IMC), which is crucial for effectiveness. However, the challenges of IMC (difficulty in integration, mixed messages) can hinder effectiveness if not managed. The passage also says that marketers need to understand advertising principles (from [S30]) to handle these aspects. \n\nI need to structure the answer by linking in-house advantages and IMC challenges to their impact on advertising effectiveness.

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S87] In order to penetrate markets, it is essential that high levels of awareness are created as early as possible in a product or brand life-cycle. [S88] Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. [S89] For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market as quickly as practical. [S90] When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the promotional effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. [S91] The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a funnel. [S92] Early in the campaign, the marketers should attempt to reach as many potential buyers as possible with high impact messages. [S93] Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotional activities such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments more likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand. [S94] ### Integrative models\n\nIntegrative models assume that consumers process advertising information via two paths \u2013 both cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) simultaneously. [S95] These models seek to combine the type of purchase with the consumer's dominant mode of processing. [S96] Integrative models are based on research findings indicating that congruence between personality and the way a persuasive message is framed. [S97] That is, aligning the message framing with the recipient's personality profile may play an important role in ensuring the success of that message. [S98] In a recent experiment, five advertisements (each designed to target one of the five personality traits) were constructed for a single product. [S99] Findings suggest that advertisements were evaluated more positively when they aligned with participants' motives. [S100] Tailoring persuasive messages to the personality traits of the targeted audience can be an effective way of enhancing the message's impact. [S101] There are many integrative frameworks. [S102] Two of the more widely used models are the grids developed by Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) (see below) and another devised by Rossiter and Percy, and which is an extension of the FCB approach. [S103] These planning grids are very popular with advertising practitioners because of their ease of application. [S104] #### Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) planning grid\n\nThe FCB planning grid was developed by Richard Vaughan, who was the senior vice president at advertising agency, Foote, Cone and Belding, in the 1980s. [S105] The planning grid has two dimensions, involvement and information processing. [S106] Each dimension has two values, representing extremes of a continuum, specifically involvement (high/low) and information processing (thinking/feeling). [S107] These form a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 matrix with four cells representing the different types of advertising effects. [S108] The FCB Planning Grid\n| Info processingType of Decision | Thinking | Feeling |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High-involvement | 1. [S109] Learn\u2192Feel\u2192Do | 2.

[S112] Do\u2192Feel\u2192 Learn |\n\nThe FCB planning grid gives rise to a number of implications for advertising and media strategy:\n\n*Quadrant 1:* High-involvement/ rational purchases: In the first quadrant consumers learn about a product through advertising after which they develop a favourable (or unfavourable) disposition to the product which may or may not culminate in a purchase. [S113] This approach is considered optimal for advertising high ticket items such as cars and household furniture. [S114] When this is the dominant approach to purchasing, advertising messages should be information-rich and media strategy should be weighted towards media such as magazines and newspapers capable of delivering long-copy advertising.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S142] The marketing plan can be expected to provide information about the company's long and short-term goals, competitive rivalry, a description of the target market, products offered, positioning strategy, pricing strategy, distribution strategy and other promotional programs. [S143] All of this information has potential implications for developing the advertising program. [S144] The advertiser must study the marketing plan carefully and determine how to translate the marketing objectives into an advertising program. [S145] Each advertising campaign is unique, so that the review requires a great deal of analysis as well as judgement. [S146] #### Overall communications objectives\n\nCommunications objectives are derived from marketing objectives. [S147] However, communications objectives must be framed in terms of communications effects. [S148] For example, a company's short-term marketing objective might be to increase sales response for a given brand. [S149] However, this objective would require that a large number of consumers are aware of the brand and are favourably disposed towards it. [S150] Furthermore, consumers' purchase intentions may be dependent on other marketing activities such as access, price, the ability to trial the brand prior to final purchase and other marketing activities. [S151] It is unfair to hold marketing communications accountable for all sales when it is only one element in the total marketing effort. [S152] While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and interest in a brand, it is less effective at turning that awareness and interest into actual sales. [S153] To convert interest into sales, different promotional tools such as personal selling or sales promotion may be more useful. [S154] Many authors caution against using sales or market share objectives for marketing communications or advertising purposes. [S155] Communications objectives might include such things as to:\n\n* increase purchase\n* encourage trial\n* encourage loyalty\n* position or re-position a brand\n* educate customers\n\nThese will need to be translated into advertising objectives. [S156] #### Target market and target audience\n\nThe review should take note of the overall target market. [S157] However, this does not necessarily mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. [S158] Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the *target audience* for an advertising message and the *target market* for a product or brand. [S159] By definition, the target audience is the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand. [S160] Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different target audiences. [S161] For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. [S162] However, for adult target audience members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. [S163] Thus, the target audience for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. [S164] Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal target audiences for specific advertising objectives. [S165] #### Push vs pull strategy",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the differences between hierarchical models and integrative models in advertising strategy and their implications for different stages of a product's life cycle. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the passage.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a section on hierarchical models. Sentence [S88] mentions that hierarchical models provide insights into the target audience, optimal message, and media strategy at different stages of the product life cycle. Then, sentences [S89] to [S93] talk about how during the early stages, the focus is on creating awareness, and later, when awareness is achieved, the effort shifts to stimulating interest, desire, or conviction. It also mentions that as the product moves through the sales cycle, the number of potential purchasers decreases, so later strategies become more targeted, like personal selling or direct mail. So hierarchical models seem to focus on stage-specific strategies, moving from broad awareness to targeted efforts as the product matures.\n\nNow, looking at the integrative models section. The key points are in sentences [S94] onwards. Integrative models assume consumers process info via both cognitive and affective paths. They combine the type of purchase with the consumer's processing mode. Sentences [S95]-[S101] discuss aligning messages with personality traits for effectiveness. The FCB grid is mentioned, which has different quadrants based on involvement and information processing. For example, high-involvement rational purchases (Quadrant 1) use information-rich messages, while low-involvement might use different approaches. The implications here are about tailoring messages based on consumer personality and decision-making processes rather than just the product stage.\n\nThe question also asks about implications for different stages of the product life cycle. The hierarchical models directly address this by suggesting strategies for early (awareness) vs later (targeted) stages. Integrative models, however, focus more on matching message framing to consumer traits, which might be applicable across stages but isn't explicitly tied to the life cycle stages. The FCB grid's implications are more about the type of decision (high/low involvement) rather than the product's life cycle phase.\n\nSo, the main difference is that hierarchical models are stage-based, adjusting strategies as the product progresses, while integrative models focus on aligning messages with consumer processing styles. The implications for the product life cycle would mean hierarchical models guide tactical shifts over time, whereas integrative models influence how messages are tailored to consumer traits at any stage.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For hierarchical models, [S88], [S89]-[S93]. For integrative models, [S94]-[S101], and the FCB grid details. The implications for life cycle stages are in the hierarchical part. The integrative models' implications are more about message-personality alignment rather than life cycle stages."

For high-involvement purchases, such as cars or furniture, the grid emphasizes a \"Learn\u2192Feel\u2192Do\" approach, prioritizing information-rich content delivered through media like magazines and newspapers.

[S108] The FCB Planning Grid\n| Info processingType of Decision | Thinking | Feeling |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High-involvement | 1. [S109] Learn\u2192Feel\u2192Do | 2.

[S112] Do\u2192Feel\u2192 Learn |\n\nThe FCB planning grid gives rise to a number of implications for advertising and media strategy:\n\n*Quadrant 1:* High-involvement/ rational purchases: In the first quadrant consumers learn about a product through advertising after which they develop a favourable (or unfavourable) disposition to the product which may or may not culminate in a purchase. [S113] This approach is considered optimal for advertising high ticket items such as cars and household furniture. [S114] When this is the dominant approach to purchasing, advertising messages should be information-rich and media strategy should be weighted towards media such as magazines and newspapers capable of delivering long-copy advertising.",
        "[S142] The marketing plan can be expected to provide information about the company's long and short-term goals, competitive rivalry, a description of the target market, products offered, positioning strategy, pricing strategy, distribution strategy and other promotional programs. [S143] All of this information has potential implications for developing the advertising program. [S144] The advertiser must study the marketing plan carefully and determine how to translate the marketing objectives into an advertising program. [S145] Each advertising campaign is unique, so that the review requires a great deal of analysis as well as judgement. [S146] #### Overall communications objectives\n\nCommunications objectives are derived from marketing objectives. [S147] However, communications objectives must be framed in terms of communications effects. [S148] For example, a company's short-term marketing objective might be to increase sales response for a given brand. [S149] However, this objective would require that a large number of consumers are aware of the brand and are favourably disposed towards it. [S150] Furthermore, consumers' purchase intentions may be dependent on other marketing activities such as access, price, the ability to trial the brand prior to final purchase and other marketing activities. [S151] It is unfair to hold marketing communications accountable for all sales when it is only one element in the total marketing effort. [S152] While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and interest in a brand, it is less effective at turning that awareness and interest into actual sales. [S153] To convert interest into sales, different promotional tools such as personal selling or sales promotion may be more useful. [S154] Many authors caution against using sales or market share objectives for marketing communications or advertising purposes. [S155] Communications objectives might include such things as to:\n\n* increase purchase\n* encourage trial\n* encourage loyalty\n* position or re-position a brand\n* educate customers\n\nThese will need to be translated into advertising objectives. [S156] #### Target market and target audience\n\nThe review should take note of the overall target market. [S157] However, this does not necessarily mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. [S158] Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the *target audience* for an advertising message and the *target market* for a product or brand. [S159] By definition, the target audience is the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand. [S160] Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different target audiences. [S161] For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. [S162] However, for adult target audience members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. [S163] Thus, the target audience for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. [S164] Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal target audiences for specific advertising objectives. [S165] #### Push vs pull strategy"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of the FCB planning grid in determining advertising strategies for high-involvement versus low-involvement purchases and how this relates to integrative models.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the FCB planning grid in several places. Specifically, there's a section titled \"Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) planning grid\" which explains that it has two dimensions: involvement (high/low) and information processing (thinking/feeling). This creates a 2x2 matrix with four quadrants. \n\nThe passage then describes each quadrant. For high-involvement purchases, like cars or furniture, the FCB grid suggests a \"Learn\u2192Feel\u2192Do\" approach. This means the advertising should be information-rich, using media like magazines and newspapers. For low-involvement, the grid has \"Do\u2192Learn\u2192Feel\" and \"Do\u2192Feel\u2192Learn,\" which might involve more immediate actions and emotional appeals.\n\nNow, the question also asks how this relates to integrative models. The passage earlier discusses integrative models as those that use both cognitive and affective paths. The FCB grid is mentioned as an example of an integrative framework, along with the Rossiter and Percy model. The integrative models aim to align message framing with the consumer's processing mode. The FCB grid's two dimensions (involvement and information processing) seem to align with this by tailoring strategies based on whether the purchase is high or low involvement and whether the consumer processes information through thinking or feeling.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The FCB grid's role in high vs low involvement is covered in S106-S114. The relation to integrative models is in S94, S102, S103, and S104. Also, the description of the grid's quadrants is in S109-S112 and the implications for advertising strategies in S113-S114.\n\nI should structure the answer by first explaining the FCB grid's role in high vs low involvement, citing the relevant sentences. Then, connect it to integrative models by citing where the passage mentions integrative models and the FCB grid as part of them. Make sure each statement has the correct citations."

[S170] ### Devising advertising objectives\n\nSetting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan. [S171] Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated.

[S173] One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach (**D**efining **A**dvertising **G**oals for **M**easured **A**dvertising **R**esults) developed in the 1960s. [S174] While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects. [S175] In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. [S176] Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:\n\nManagerial Options for Communications Objectives\n| Target Consumer's State of Mind | Communication/ Advertising Objective | Advertising Message Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category Need** * Category need already present * Latent category need * No or weak category need | * Omit category need as an objective of advertising or promotion * Mention category need to remind customer of previously established need * \"Sell\" category need using positive or negative motivations (e.g. [S177] pain removal, pain avoidance, dissatisfaction, sensory gratification, social approval) | *Pain avoidance*: \"For fast, sure pain relief, Anacin\" |\n| **Brand Awareness** * *Brand recall* * *Brand recognition* | * Use taglines, slogans, jingles to teach brand recall and strengthen learning * Associate brand name with category * Show product packaging or label in all advertising | *Paired category-brand association*: \"When you think of chocolate, think of Cadbury\" |\n| **Brand Preference** * Negative preference * Unaware * Moderate preference * Strong preference | * Change to moderate preference * Create strong preference * Increase preference * Reinforce strong preference | *Brand Preference*: \"The burgers are better at Burger King (or Hungry Jack's)\" |\n| **Purchase Intention** * Low-involvement decision * High-involvement decision | * Omit purchase-intention * Generate purchase-intention | *Purchase-intention*: \"Hurry, hurry last days, offer must expire soon\"; \"Don't wait- limited stocks available\" |\n| **Purchase Facilitation** * Customer knows where to purchase product or service and how much to pay for it * Not obvious where to purchase or how to find retailer | * Omit purchase-facilitation * Incorporate purchase-facilitation in all marketing communications | *Purchase-facilitation*: \"Refer to website for nearest stockist\" |\n\nPassage 2:\n[S66] Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. [S67] These models suggest that simple exposure to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention.

[S70] In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:\n\nThis path is also known as the *peripheral route to persuasion*. [S71] Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. [S72] In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising). [S73] ### Hierarchy of effects models\n\nHierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. [S74] The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. [S75] A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, DAGMAR and AIDA and other variants. [S76] Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory, and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied. [S77] The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from brand awareness through to action (purchase and consumption). [S78] As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects, they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. [S79] Thus, the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence. [S80] The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:\n\nThe literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. [S81] The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models.

[S85] The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as *conversion.* While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale.

The user is asking about how the promotional mix and media focus differences between push and pull strategies relate to the hierarchy of effects models, and the role of the conversion process in turning purchase intention into sales.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions push and pull strategies in S167-S169. Push strategies target retailers with trade advertising and sales calls, using trade magazines, exhibitions. Pull strategies target consumers directly with consumer-oriented ads and sales promotions, using mass-market media like TV, radio. \n\nNow, the hierarchy of effects models are discussed in Passage 2, especially S74-S85. These models like AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) outline stages from awareness to action. The conversion process is mentioned in S85-S86, where it's the step from purchase intention to actual sales, needing support from other marketing elements.\n\nSo, how do push/pull relate to these models? Push strategies might align with the earlier stages (awareness, maybe preference) by building relationships with retailers, which then influence consumers. Pull strategies directly target consumers, possibly affecting awareness and purchase intention more directly. The promotional mix differences (trade vs. mass media) would influence which stages of the hierarchy they target. For example, trade ads in push might support brand awareness among retailers, while pull's mass media could drive awareness and desire.\n\nThe conversion process (S86) is about turning intent into sales. The source says advertising creates intent but needs other elements like pricing or promotions. So, in the hierarchy, conversion is the final step after purchase intention. Push strategies might focus on getting the product on shelves (conversion via distribution), while pull strategies might use promotions to convert intent.\n\nI need to make sure each part of the answer is cited correctly. Check the sentences again. For example, the promotional mix differences are in S169. Hierarchy models are in S74-S85. Conversion is in S85-S86. Also, the AIDA model is mentioned in S77 and S80. \n\nSo, structuring the answer: first explain push vs pull promotional mix and media, link to hierarchy stages, then explain conversion's role.

[S82] Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour. [S83] Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits. [S84] Selected hierarchical models follow:\n\nAll hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. [S85] The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as *conversion.* While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale. [S86] Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms, guarantees or a strong call-to-action as part of the advertising message.",

        "[S166] The communications objectives will, at least in part, depend on whether the marketer is using a push or pull strategy. [S167] In a *push strategy*, the marketer advertises intensively with retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. [S168] In contrast, in a *pull strategy*, the marketer advertises directly to consumers hoping that they will put pressure on retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. [S169] In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer-oriented advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio. [S170] ### Devising advertising objectives\n\nSetting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan. [S171] Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated. [S172] Advertising objectives should be **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable and **T**ime-dependent (SMART).\u1da0\u1d43\u2071\u02e1\u1d49\u1d48 \u1d5b\u1d49\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks \u2013 that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated. [S173] One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach (**D**efining **A**dvertising **G**oals for **M**easured **A**dvertising **R**esults) developed in the 1960s. [S174] While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects. [S175] In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. [S176] Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:\n\nManagerial Options for Communications Objectives\n| Target Consumer's State of Mind | Communication/ Advertising Objective | Advertising Message Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category Need** * Category need already present * Latent category need * No or weak category need | * Omit category need as an objective of advertising or promotion * Mention category need to remind customer of previously established need * \"Sell\" category need using positive or negative motivations (e.g. [S177] pain removal, pain avoidance, dissatisfaction, sensory gratification, social approval) | *Pain avoidance*: \"For fast, sure pain relief, Anacin\" |\n| **Brand Awareness** * *Brand recall* * *Brand recognition* | * Use taglines, slogans, jingles to teach brand recall and strengthen learning * Associate brand name with category * Show product packaging or label in all advertising | *Paired category-brand association*: \"When you think of chocolate, think of Cadbury\" |\n| **Brand Preference** * Negative preference * Unaware * Moderate preference * Strong preference | * Change to moderate preference * Create strong preference * Increase preference * Reinforce strong preference | *Brand Preference*: \"The burgers are better at Burger King (or Hungry Jack's)\" |\n| **Purchase Intention** * Low-involvement decision * High-involvement decision | * Omit purchase-intention * Generate purchase-intention | *Purchase-intention*: \"Hurry, hurry last days, offer must expire soon\"; \"Don't wait- limited stocks available\" |\n| **Purchase Facilitation** * Customer knows where to purchase product or service and how much to pay for it * Not obvious where to purchase or how to find retailer | * Omit purchase-facilitation * Incorporate purchase-facilitation in all marketing communications | *Purchase-facilitation*: \"Refer to website for nearest stockist\" |",
        "[S66] Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. [S67] These models suggest that simple exposure to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention. [S68] Exposure in the form of advertising messages leads to an attitude to the advertisement (A\u2090d) which transfers to the attitude to the brand (Ab) without any further cognitive processing. [S69] Exposure it not restricted to physical contact; rather it can refer to any brand-related contact such as advertising, promotion or virtual brands on websites. [S70] In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:\n\nThis path is also known as the *peripheral route to persuasion*. [S71] Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. [S72] In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising). [S73] ### Hierarchy of effects models\n\nHierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. [S74] The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. [S75] A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, DAGMAR and AIDA and other variants. [S76] Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory, and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied. [S77] The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from brand awareness through to action (purchase and consumption). [S78] As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects, they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. [S79] Thus, the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence. [S80] The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:\n\nThe literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. [S81] The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models. [S82] Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour. [S83] Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits. [S84] Selected hierarchical models follow:\n\nAll hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. [S85] The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as *conversion.* While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the five communication effects from the table (category need, brand awareness, brand preference, purchase intention, purchase facilitation) align with the Cognition-Affect-Behavior (CAB) stages in hierarchical models, and how this relates to the limitations of the DAGMAR approach mentioned in the source.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the CAB model entails. From the passage, it says that hierarchical models include Cognition, Affect, Behavior as core steps. So each stage in CAB corresponds to different consumer responses. The five communication effects in the table are probably mapped to these stages.\n\nLooking at the table, the first effect is Category Need. The passage mentions that category need is about the consumer's state of mind. If I think about CAB, cognition would involve awareness or knowledge. So maybe category need relates to the cognitive stage. But the table's examples for category need include things like pain removal or social approval, which might be more affective. Hmm, need to check the passage again.\n\nWait, the passage under \"Managerial Options for Communications Objectives\" has the table. The first row is Category Need, with objectives like mentioning category need to remind customers or \"sell\" the need using motivations. The examples given are about creating a need, which might be part of the cognitive stage, but the motivations (like pain removal) could be affective. Maybe the communication effects are part of different stages.\n\nNext, Brand Awareness is about recall and recognition. That seems like a cognitive stage, as it's about awareness. Then Brand Preference is about preference, which is more affective. Purchase Intention is the intention to buy, which is a behavioral intent, and Purchase Facilitation is about making it easy to purchase, which is more behavioral.\n\nSo aligning them with CAB: Cognition (Category Need, Brand Awareness), Affect (Brand Preference), Behavior (Purchase Intention, Purchase Facilitation). But the question is about how they align with CAB stages. The passage mentions that hierarchical models have Cognition, Affect, Behavior as steps. So each communication effect would map to these stages.\n\nNow, the DAGMAR approach's limitation is that it fails to link advertising objectives with communications effects. The passage says that DAGMAR doesn't provide concrete guidance on linking objectives with these effects. The five communication effects are part of the process that DAGMAR didn't address well. So the alignment with CAB stages shows that the effects are part of the sequential steps, but DAGMAR's limitation is not connecting these steps properly.\n\nI need to check the citations. The question is about the alignment and how it relates to DAGMAR's limitations. The relevant parts are in Passage 1 and 2. For example, S176 mentions Rossiter and Bellman's five communication effects. S173-175 talk about DAGMAR's failure. The CAB stages are discussed in S79 and S80. The table is in S176-S177. So the alignment would be cited from the table and the CAB explanation.\n\nSo the answer would state that the five effects align with CAB stages, with category need and brand awareness under cognition, brand preference under affect, and purchase intention and facilitation under behavior. The DAGMAR approach's limitation is that it doesn't link objectives to these effects, as mentioned in S174 and S175. The CAB model's structure is in S79 and S80."

[S265] In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency. [S266] Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where and when media is used and the cost of data collection. [S267] All these methods involve sampling \u2013 that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population. [S268] Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process. [S269] Media research acts as form of industry regulation and the legitimacy of research methodologies and provision of audience metrics. [S270] Media owners rely on metrics of both audience size and audience quality to set advertising rates. [S271] Measures of media audience that are of especial interest to advertisers include:\n\n**Print Media**\n\n* *Circulation:* the number of copies of an issue sold (independently assessed via a circulation audit)\n* *Readership:* the total number of people who have seen or looked into a current edition of the a publication (independently measured via survey)\n* *Readership profiles:* Demographic/ psychographic and behavioural analysis of readership (sourced from Readership surveys)\n\n**Broadcast Media**\n\n* *Average audience:* The average number of people who tuned into the given time or given program, expressed in thousands or as a percentage.

[S299] Broadly, there are four basic approaches to scheduling:\n\nEmpirical support for the effectiveness of pulsing is relatively weak. [S300] However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall. [S301] With flighted schedules, the second and subsequent flights tend to build on the first flight, resulting in awareness levels similar to a continuous schedule, but often with reduced costs. [S302] A major consideration in constructing media schedules is timing. [S303] The advertiser's main is to place the advertisement as close as practical to the point where consumers make their purchase decision. [S304] For example, an advertiser who knows that a grocery buyer does a main shop on Saturday afternoons and a top-up shop on Wednesday nights, may consider TV to achieve general brand awareness, supplemented with radio spots to reach the shopper while he or she is driving to the supermarket or regular place of purchase on the days when the majority of consumers carry out their shopping. [S305] ## Measuring advertising effectiveness\n\nAdvertising is a major expense for most firms. [S306] Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. [S307] Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. [S308] Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects. [S309] The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates. [S310] Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing: Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects. [S311] * *Pre-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses\n\n* *Post-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives.

[S315] ##### Mock-ups\n\nResearchers often use mock-ups of the final creative with varying degrees of finished artwork. [S316] Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. [S317] However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. [S318] Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. [S319] A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign.

Passage 2 discusses media scheduling, effectiveness measurement, and pre-testing.\n\nFor the first part of the question: How does media audience research contribute to advertising effectiveness? Looking at Passage 1, sentence [S259] mentions that the main purpose is to eliminate waste in advertising by analyzing available media. That directly relates to effectiveness. Also, [S270] states that media owners use audience size and quality metrics to set advertising rates, which would affect how effective ads are. Additionally, [S271] lists measures like circulation, readership, and audience profiles that are important to advertisers. These metrics help target the right audience, making ads more effective.\n\nThen, the role in media scheduling. Passage 2's [S298] defines a media schedule and mentions that timing is a major consideration. [S303] says the main goal is to place ads close to the purchase decision point. Media research would inform this by providing audience data. For example, knowing when the target audience is most active (like Saturday afternoons for grocery shoppers in [S305]) helps schedule ads effectively. Also, [S260] mentions profiling the audience, which would help in selecting the right media channels for scheduling.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correctly referenced.

[S300] However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall.

[S305] ## Measuring advertising effectiveness\n\nAdvertising is a major expense for most firms. [S306] Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. [S307] Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. [S308] Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects. [S309] The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates. [S310] Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing: Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects. [S311] * *Pre-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses\n\n* *Post-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives.

[S316] Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. [S317] However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. [S318] Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. [S319] A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign.

        "[S258] Media audience research is a central feature of media planning. [S259] The main purpose of media research is \"to eliminate waste in advertising by objectively analysing the media available for promoting products and services\". [S260] Identifying and profiling the audience for print media, broadcast media, cinema and online media magazine or newspaper is a specialized form of market research, often conducted on behalf of media owners. [S261] In most nations, the advertising industry, via its peak industry associations, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement for main media. [S262] The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the *industry currency* in audience measurement. [S263] Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings. [S264] In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. [S265] In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency. [S266] Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where and when media is used and the cost of data collection. [S267] All these methods involve sampling \u2013 that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population. [S268] Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that determine the existence of an 'industry currency' in audience measurement and how that affects media planning across different countries. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage mentions \"industry currency\" in several places. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nLooking at the first passage, sentence S262 says, \"The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the *industry currency* in audience measurement.\" So the methodology of the official provider is the industry currency. Then, S261 states that the advertising industry endorses a single media research company as the official provider. So the existence of an industry currency depends on whether there's a single endorsed provider. \n\nS264 mentions that in some countries, if the industry is fragmented or no peak association exists, there might be multiple providers, leading to no industry currency (S265). So the factors are the presence of a single official provider (endorsed by the industry) and the structure of the industry (fragmented or not). \n\nNow, how does this affect media planning across countries? If a country has an industry currency (single methodology), media planners can rely on consistent metrics. But in countries without it, different methodologies might lead to varying data, making cross-country comparisons or planning more complex. The passage also mentions that research companies use different methods based on location and cost (S266), which could affect how media planning is done in different regions. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The factors are covered in S261, S262, S264, S265. The effect on media planning would relate to S266 and maybe S270, but the direct impact is implied by the existence of different methodologies. The answer should tie these points together with the citations."

[S2] Brand advertising is defined as a non-personal communication message placed in a paid, mass medium designed to persuade target consumers of a product or service benefits in an effort to induce them to make a purchase.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Corporate advertising refers to paid messages designed to communicate the corporation's values to influence public opinion. [S3] Yet other types of advertising such as not-for-profit advertising and political advertising present special challenges that require different strategies and approaches.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\nAdvertising management is a complex process that involves making many layered decisions including developing advertising strategies, setting an advertising budget, setting advertising objectives, determining the target market, media strategy (which involves media planning), developing the message strategy, and evaluating the overall effectiveness of the advertising effort.) Advertising management may also involve media buying. [S4] Advertising management is a complex process. [S5] However, at its simplest level, advertising management can be reduced to four key decision areas:\n\n\n## Advertising and advertising management: definitions\n\nConsumers tend to think that all forms of commercial promotion constitute advertising. [S6] However, in marketing and advertising, the term \"advertising\" has a very special meaning that reflects its status as a distinct type of promotion.",
    "[S7] The marketing and advertising literature has many different definitions of advertising, but it is possible to identify common elements or themes within most of these definitions. [S8] The American Marketing Association (AMA) defines advertising as \"the placement of announcements and persuasive messages in time or space purchased in any of the mass media by business firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and individuals who seek to inform and/ or persuade members of a particular target market or audience about their products, services, organizations, or ideas\". [S9] The *American Heritage Dictionary* defines advertising as \"the activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media\". [S10] Selected marketing scholars have defined advertising in the following terms: \"any non-personal communication that is paid for by an identified sponsor, and involves either mass communication viz newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other media (e.g., billboards, bus stop signage) or direct to-consumer communication via direct mail\". [S11] and \"the element of the marketing communications mix that is non-personal, paid for by an identified sponsor, and disseminated through mass channels of communication to promote the adoption of goods, services, persons, or ideas.\" One of the shortest definitions is that advertising is \"a paid, mass-mediated attempt to persuade\". [S12] Several common themes emerge in the various definitions of advertising:\n\n* Advertising is a *paid* form of communication and is therefore commercial. [S13] * Advertising employs *non-personal channels* (i.e. [S14] commercial mass media) which implies that it is directed at a mass audience rather than at an individual consumer and is a one-way communication mode where the sponsor sends messages, but recipients cannot respond or ask questions about the message content. [S15] * Advertising has an *identified sponsor*. [S16] In summary, given that advertising is paid, it is one of the many controllable elements in the marketing program. [S17] Advertising is qualitatively different from publicity where the message sponsor is either not identified or ambiguously defined, and different from personal selling which occurs in real-time and involves some face-to-face contact between the message sponsor and recipient allowing for two-way dialogue. [S18] While advertising refers to the advertising message, per se, advertising management refers to the process of planning and executing an advertising campaign or campaigns; that is, it is a series of planned decisions that begins with market research continues through to setting advertising budgets, developing advertising objectives, executing the creative messages and follows up with efforts to measure the extent to which objectives were achieved and evaluate the cost-benefit of the overall advertising effort. [S19] ## Advertising and organisational responsibilities\n\nIn commercial organisations, advertising, along with other marketing communications activities, is the ultimate responsibility of the marketing department. [S20] Some companies outsource part or all of the work to specialists such as advertising agencies, creative design teams, web designers, media buyers, events management specialists or other relevant service providers. [S21] Another option is for a company to carry out most or all of the advertising functions within the marketing department in what is known as an *in-house agency*. [S22] By definition, an in-house agency is \"an advertising organization that is owned and operated by the corporation it serves\". [S23] Its mission is to provide advertising services in support of its parent company's business and marketing objectives. [S24] Well-known brands that currently use in-house agencies include Google,\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 Calvin Klein, Adobe, Dell, IBM, Kraft, Marriott and Wendy's.",
    "[S25] Both in-house agencies and outsourcing models have their own advantages and disadvantages. [S26] Outsourcing to an external agency allows marketers to obtain highly specialised strategic, research and planning skills, access to top creative talent and provides an independent perspective on marketing or advertising problems. [S27] In-house agencies deliver cost advantages, time efficiencies and afford marketers greater control over the advertising effort. [S28] In addition, personnel who work within an in-house agency gain considerable creative experience which stays within the company. [S29] Recent trends suggest that the number of in-house agencies is rising. [S30] Whether a company chooses to outsource advertising functions to an external agency or carry them out within the marketing department, marketers need a rich understanding of advertising principles in order to prepare effective advertising plans, brief relevant agencies about their needs and expectations or develop their own creative solutions to marketing problems. [S31] ## Advertising's role in the promotional mix\n\nThe promotional mix is the specific combination of promotional methods used for a brand, product or family of products. [S32] Advertising is best treated as a *multiplier* that can leverage other elements of the promotional mix and marketing program. [S33] Therefore, advertising must be considered as part of a broader marketing and promotional program. [S34] The promotional mix includes a variety of tools such as:\n\nAdvertising is just one of many elements that comprise the promotional mix. [S35] When marketers communicate with target markets across a broad range of different promotional types and media, the potential for contradictory or mixed messages is very real. [S36] Accordingly, it is important that advertising is treated as part of a total marketing communications program and that steps are taken to ensure that it is integrated with all other marketing communications, so that all communications messages speak with a 'single voice'. [S37] The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as *integrated marketing communications*. [S38] Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. [S39] For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. [S40] Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. [S41] The \"right\" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency. [S42] In addition, decision-makers need to recognise that consumers rely on different information sources at different stages of the purchase decision process. [S43] Therefore, advertising and other elements of the promotional campaign must be integrated to ensure that consumers receive the right messages via the right channels at the right time, depending on the consumer's readiness to buy. [S44] In terms of integrated communications, the literature identifies different types of integration: (1) *Image integration* refers to messages that have a consistent look and feel, regardless of the medium; (2) *Functional integration* refers to capacity of different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message; (3) *Coordinated integration* refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. [S45] web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants) coordinate to provide a consistent message; (4) *Stakeholder integration* refers to the way that all stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers and others cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values and (5) *Relationship integration* refers to the way that communications professionals contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.",
    "[S46] On the surface, integrated marketing communications appear to be simple common sense. [S47] Yet, a survey of brand advertisers carried out by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) revealed that while 67 per cent of marketers engage in integrated marketing communications, just one third are satisfied with their efforts. [S48] In practice, integrating communications messages across a broad range of promotional formats and media channels is very difficult to achieve. [S49] ## Theories of advertising effects\n\nStudies have repeatedly demonstrated a clear association between advertising and sales response. [S50] Yet the exact process that leads from the consumer of being exposed to an advertising message through to a purchase or behavioral response is not entirely clear. [S51] Noting the difficulties in explaining how advertising works, one theorist wrote, \"Only the brave or ignorant...can say exactly what advertising does in the marketplace.\"\n\nThe advertising and marketing literature suggests a variety of different models to explain how advertising works. [S52] These models are not competing theories, but rather explanations of how advertising persuades or influences different types of consumers in different purchase contexts. [S53] In a seminal paper, Vankratsas and Ambler surveyed more than 250 papers to develop a typology of advertising models. [S54] They identified four broad classes of model: *cognitive information models*, *pure affect models*, *hierarchy of effect models*, *integrative models* and *hierarchy-free models*. [S55] ### Cognitive information models\n\nAdvertising researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding both the degree and type of cognitive elaboration that occurs when consumers are exposed to persuasive messages. [S56] Cognitive information models assume that consumers are rational decision-makers, and that advertising provides consumers with information utility by reducing the need to search for other information about a brand. [S57] For example, an advertisement in the *Yellow Pages* or an online directory means that the consumer does not have to travel from store to store in search of a product or service. [S58] Consumers process this information at a cognitive level before forming an attitude to the brand and purchase intent. [S59] A cognition is any thought that surfaces during the elaboration of the information. [S60] Cognitive information models are also known as the *central route to persuasion*. [S61] A common theme in cognitive information models is that the net favourability of cognitive responses has a direct influence on attitude strength. [S62] In the cognitive information models, the general path to persuasion is as follows:\n\nTheoretical works, combined with empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products). [S63] Research studies also suggest that consumers who are involved in the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level. [S64] ### Pure affect models\n\nPure affect models suggest that consumers shape their preferences to a brand based on the feelings and attitudes elicited by exposure to an advertising message. [S65] When consumers view an advertisement, they not only develop attitudes towards the advertisement and the advertiser, but also develop feelings and beliefs about the brand being advertised.",
    "[S66] Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. [S67] These models suggest that simple exposure to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention. [S68] Exposure in the form of advertising messages leads to an attitude to the advertisement (A\u2090d) which transfers to the attitude to the brand (Ab) without any further cognitive processing. [S69] Exposure it not restricted to physical contact; rather it can refer to any brand-related contact such as advertising, promotion or virtual brands on websites. [S70] In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:\n\nThis path is also known as the *peripheral route to persuasion*. [S71] Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. [S72] In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising). [S73] ### Hierarchy of effects models\n\nHierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. [S74] The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. [S75] A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, DAGMAR and AIDA and other variants. [S76] Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory, and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied. [S77] The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from brand awareness through to action (purchase and consumption). [S78] As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects, they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. [S79] Thus, the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence. [S80] The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:\n\nThe literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. [S81] The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models. [S82] Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour. [S83] Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits. [S84] Selected hierarchical models follow:\n\nAll hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. [S85] The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as *conversion.* While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale. [S86] Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms, guarantees or a strong call-to-action as part of the advertising message.",
    "[S87] In order to penetrate markets, it is essential that high levels of awareness are created as early as possible in a product or brand life-cycle. [S88] Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. [S89] For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market as quickly as practical. [S90] When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the promotional effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. [S91] The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a funnel. [S92] Early in the campaign, the marketers should attempt to reach as many potential buyers as possible with high impact messages. [S93] Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotional activities such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments more likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand. [S94] ### Integrative models\n\nIntegrative models assume that consumers process advertising information via two paths \u2013 both cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) simultaneously. [S95] These models seek to combine the type of purchase with the consumer's dominant mode of processing. [S96] Integrative models are based on research findings indicating that congruence between personality and the way a persuasive message is framed. [S97] That is, aligning the message framing with the recipient's personality profile may play an important role in ensuring the success of that message. [S98] In a recent experiment, five advertisements (each designed to target one of the five personality traits) were constructed for a single product. [S99] Findings suggest that advertisements were evaluated more positively when they aligned with participants' motives. [S100] Tailoring persuasive messages to the personality traits of the targeted audience can be an effective way of enhancing the message's impact. [S101] There are many integrative frameworks. [S102] Two of the more widely used models are the grids developed by Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) (see below) and another devised by Rossiter and Percy, and which is an extension of the FCB approach. [S103] These planning grids are very popular with advertising practitioners because of their ease of application. [S104] #### Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) planning grid\n\nThe FCB planning grid was developed by Richard Vaughan, who was the senior vice president at advertising agency, Foote, Cone and Belding, in the 1980s. [S105] The planning grid has two dimensions, involvement and information processing. [S106] Each dimension has two values, representing extremes of a continuum, specifically involvement (high/low) and information processing (thinking/feeling). [S107] These form a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 matrix with four cells representing the different types of advertising effects. [S108] The FCB Planning Grid\n| Info processingType of Decision | Thinking | Feeling |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| High-involvement | 1. [S109] Learn\u2192Feel\u2192Do | 2. [S110] Feel\u2192Learn\u2192Do |\n| Low-involvement | 3. [S111] Do\u2192Learn\u2192Feel | 4. [S112] Do\u2192Feel\u2192 Learn |\n\nThe FCB planning grid gives rise to a number of implications for advertising and media strategy:\n\n*Quadrant 1:* High-involvement/ rational purchases: In the first quadrant consumers learn about a product through advertising after which they develop a favourable (or unfavourable) disposition to the product which may or may not culminate in a purchase. [S113] This approach is considered optimal for advertising high ticket items such as cars and household furniture. [S114] When this is the dominant approach to purchasing, advertising messages should be information-rich and media strategy should be weighted towards media such as magazines and newspapers capable of delivering long-copy advertising.",
    "[S115] *Quadrant 2*: High-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the second quadrant, audiences exhibit an emotional response to advertisements which transfers to products. [S116] This approach is used for products such as jewellery, expensive perfumes and designer fashion where consumers are emotionally involved in the purchase. [S117] When this mode of purchasing is evident, advertising should be designed to create a strong brand image and media should be selected to support the relevant image. [S118] For example, magazines such as *Vogue* can help to create an up-market image. [S119] *Quadrant 3*: Low-involvement/ rational purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident for many packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. [S120] Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption the benefit of using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). [S121] Given that this is a rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. [S122] Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy should be weighted towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion. [S123] *Quadrant 4*: Low-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the final quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases that make them feel good. [S124] Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. [S125] The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. [S126] When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should \"congratulate\" customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they are close to the point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays. [S127] Examples of this approach include \"McDonald's \u2013 You Deserve a Break Today\" and \"L'Oreal- Because You're Worth It\". [S128] ### Hierarchy-free models\n\nMany authors have treated reason (rational processes) and emotion (affective processes) as entirely independent. [S129] Yet, other researchers have argued that both reason and emotion can be employed simultaneously, to process advertising information. [S130] Hierarchy-free models draw on evidence from psychology and consumer neuroscience which suggest that consumers process information via different pathways rather than in any linear/ sequential manner. [S131] Thus, hierarchy-free models do not employ any fixed processing sequence. [S132] These models treat advertising as part of the brand totality. [S133] Some hierarchy-free models treat brands as 'myth' and advertising as 'myth-making' while other models seek to tap into the consumer's memories of pleasant consumption experiences (e.g. [S134] the MAC- Memory-Affect-Cognition model). [S135] Hierarchy-free models are of increasing interest to academics and practitioners because they are more customer-centric and allow for the possibility of consumer co-creation of value. [S136] ## Advertising planning\n\nAdvertising planning does not occur in a vacuum. [S137] Advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives. [S138] Therefore, the first step in any advertising planning is to review to the objectives as set out in the marketing plan. [S139] This is designed to ensure that all promotional efforts, including advertising, are working towards achieving both short-term and long-term corporate and marketing goals and align with the company's values and vision. [S140] ### Review the marketing plan\n\nA review of the marketing plan can be a relatively simple process, or it can involve a formal review, known as an *audit*. [S141] The review or audit might consider such issues as prior marketing communications activity, an evaluation of what has been effective in the past, whether new market research studies are warranted, an outline of competitive advertising activity and a review of budgetary considerations.",
    "[S142] The marketing plan can be expected to provide information about the company's long and short-term goals, competitive rivalry, a description of the target market, products offered, positioning strategy, pricing strategy, distribution strategy and other promotional programs. [S143] All of this information has potential implications for developing the advertising program. [S144] The advertiser must study the marketing plan carefully and determine how to translate the marketing objectives into an advertising program. [S145] Each advertising campaign is unique, so that the review requires a great deal of analysis as well as judgement. [S146] #### Overall communications objectives\n\nCommunications objectives are derived from marketing objectives. [S147] However, communications objectives must be framed in terms of communications effects. [S148] For example, a company's short-term marketing objective might be to increase sales response for a given brand. [S149] However, this objective would require that a large number of consumers are aware of the brand and are favourably disposed towards it. [S150] Furthermore, consumers' purchase intentions may be dependent on other marketing activities such as access, price, the ability to trial the brand prior to final purchase and other marketing activities. [S151] It is unfair to hold marketing communications accountable for all sales when it is only one element in the total marketing effort. [S152] While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and interest in a brand, it is less effective at turning that awareness and interest into actual sales. [S153] To convert interest into sales, different promotional tools such as personal selling or sales promotion may be more useful. [S154] Many authors caution against using sales or market share objectives for marketing communications or advertising purposes. [S155] Communications objectives might include such things as to:\n\n* increase purchase\n* encourage trial\n* encourage loyalty\n* position or re-position a brand\n* educate customers\n\nThese will need to be translated into advertising objectives. [S156] #### Target market and target audience\n\nThe review should take note of the overall target market. [S157] However, this does not necessarily mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. [S158] Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the *target audience* for an advertising message and the *target market* for a product or brand. [S159] By definition, the target audience is the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand. [S160] Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different target audiences. [S161] For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. [S162] However, for adult target audience members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. [S163] Thus, the target audience for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. [S164] Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal target audiences for specific advertising objectives. [S165] #### Push vs pull strategy",
    "[S166] The communications objectives will, at least in part, depend on whether the marketer is using a push or pull strategy. [S167] In a *push strategy*, the marketer advertises intensively with retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. [S168] In contrast, in a *pull strategy*, the marketer advertises directly to consumers hoping that they will put pressure on retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. [S169] In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer-oriented advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio. [S170] ### Devising advertising objectives\n\nSetting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan. [S171] Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated. [S172] Advertising objectives should be **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable and **T**ime-dependent (SMART).\u1da0\u1d43\u2071\u02e1\u1d49\u1d48 \u1d5b\u1d49\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks \u2013 that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated. [S173] One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach (**D**efining **A**dvertising **G**oals for **M**easured **A**dvertising **R**esults) developed in the 1960s. [S174] While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects. [S175] In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. [S176] Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:\n\nManagerial Options for Communications Objectives\n| Target Consumer's State of Mind | Communication/ Advertising Objective | Advertising Message Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Category Need** * Category need already present * Latent category need * No or weak category need | * Omit category need as an objective of advertising or promotion * Mention category need to remind customer of previously established need * \"Sell\" category need using positive or negative motivations (e.g. [S177] pain removal, pain avoidance, dissatisfaction, sensory gratification, social approval) | *Pain avoidance*: \"For fast, sure pain relief, Anacin\" |\n| **Brand Awareness** * *Brand recall* * *Brand recognition* | * Use taglines, slogans, jingles to teach brand recall and strengthen learning * Associate brand name with category * Show product packaging or label in all advertising | *Paired category-brand association*: \"When you think of chocolate, think of Cadbury\" |\n| **Brand Preference** * Negative preference * Unaware * Moderate preference * Strong preference | * Change to moderate preference * Create strong preference * Increase preference * Reinforce strong preference | *Brand Preference*: \"The burgers are better at Burger King (or Hungry Jack's)\" |\n| **Purchase Intention** * Low-involvement decision * High-involvement decision | * Omit purchase-intention * Generate purchase-intention | *Purchase-intention*: \"Hurry, hurry last days, offer must expire soon\"; \"Don't wait- limited stocks available\" |\n| **Purchase Facilitation** * Customer knows where to purchase product or service and how much to pay for it * Not obvious where to purchase or how to find retailer | * Omit purchase-facilitation * Incorporate purchase-facilitation in all marketing communications | *Purchase-facilitation*: \"Refer to website for nearest stockist\" |",
    "[S178] For many purchases, category need and purchase facilitation will be present in the customer's mind and can be omitted from the advertising objectives. [S179] However, for some purchases, the customer may not be aware of the product category or may not know how to access it, in which case these objectives will need to be addressed in the communications objectives. [S180] Brand awareness, brand preference and purchase intention are almost always included as advertising objectives. [S181] ### Setting advertising budgets\n\nA firm's advertising budget is a sub-set of its overall budget. [S182] For many firms, the cost of advertising is one of the largest expenses, second only to wages and salaries. [S183] Advertising expenditure varies enormously according to firm size, market coverage, managerial expectations and even managerial style. [S184] Procter and Gamble, the top US advertiser, spent US$4.3 billion in 2015 on national media (exclusive of agency fees and production costs) while a small local advertiser might spend just a few thousand dollars in the same period. [S185] The size of the budget has implications for the promotional mix, the media mix and market coverage. [S186] As a generalisation, very large budgets are required to sustain national television campaigns. [S187] Advertisers with tight budgets may forced to use less effective media alternatives. [S188] However, even advertisers with small budgets may be able to incorporate expensive main media, by focusing on narrow geographic markets, buying spots in non-peak time periods and carefully managing advertising schedules. [S189] A number of different methods are used to develop the advertising (and/or marketing communications) budget. [S190] The most commonly used methods are: percentage-of-sales, objective and task, competitive parity method, market share method, unit sales method, all available funds method and the affordable method. [S191] #### Percentage-of-sales method\n\nUsing the percentage-of-sales method, the advertiser allocates a fixed percentage (say 5% or 10%) of forecast sales value to the advertising budget. [S192] This method is predicated on the assumption that advertising causes future sales volume. [S193] The percentage of sales method is the easiest method to use and for this reason remains one of the most widely used methods for setting budgets. [S194] A major problem with the\u00a0%-of-sales method is that there is no consensus about the percentage value to apply. [S195] Some companies use industry averages as a guide to set their marcomms budget. [S196] The following table, based on industry averages, shows that the\u00a0% value can vary from around 20% of sales to less than 1 percent. [S197] Ad-to-sales ratios for selected industries, 2004\n| Industry | Ad-to-sales ratio |\n| --- | --- |\n| Health services | 18.7 |\n| Transportation services | 14.2 |\n| Motion pictures and videotape production | 13.7 |\n| Food | 11.9 |\n| Computer & office equipment | 11.9 |\n| Computer & software wholesale | 0.2 |\n\n\n#### Objective and task method\n\nThe objective and task method is the most rational and defensible of all budgeting methods. [S198] In this method, the advertiser determines the advertising objectives and then defines specific, measurable communication tasks that will need to be undertaken to achieve the desired objectives. [S199] Cost estimates are developed for each communication task in order to arrive at a total budget estimate. [S200] This method is time-consuming and complex, and as a consequence has been less widely used in practice, however, recent research suggests that more marketers are taking up this approach. [S201] #### Competitive parity method\n\nThe competitive parity method allocates the advertising or promotional budget based on competitive spending for comparable activities. [S202] This approach is a defensive strategy used to protect a brand market position. [S203] It assumes that rival firms have similar objectives and is widely used in highly competitive markets. [S204] The main criticism of this method is that it assumes competitors know what they are doing in relation to advertising expenditure.",
    "[S205] There are several approaches to using the competitive parity method:\n\nCompetitive parity requires a detailed understanding of competitor's expenditure in key areas. [S206] Market intelligence used to inform this approach can be obtained by consulting company annual reports and also from commercial research service providers such as Nielsen's AdEx. [S207] Other methods used to set advertising and promotional budgets include the *market share method*, *unit sales method*, *all available funds method*, *affordable method*, *marginal analysis* and others. [S208] Contemporary budgeting rarely relies on a single method, but instead uses a combination of methods to guide the marketer in determining the optimal expenditure levels. [S209] ### Devising the creative strategy\n\nThe creative strategy is also known as the *message strategy.* The creative strategy explains how the advertising campaign will address the advertising objectives. [S210] Developing the creative strategy typically begins by identifying the big idea (also known as the *creative concept* that will establish the intended product position in the minds of the customer. [S211] Another way of thinking about the creative concept is that it refers to the one thing that will make consumers respond. [S212] The creative concept should show how the product benefit meets the customer's needs or expectations in a unique way. [S213] Laskey et al. [S214] developed a typology of nine creative strategies. [S215] Initially devised for television, this typology has been widely adopted for other media including print media and social media. [S216] Laskey, Day and Crask's typology first identifies two broad classes of creative strategy:\n\n* Informational: rational appeals that typically provide information about the brand's benefits\n* Transformational: emotional appeals that assist consumers to imagine an aspirational lifestyle\n\nInformational appeals typically involve factual claims that list the product's benefits in a straightforward manner and are more likely to be used with high involvement goods. [S217] Transformational appeals play on emotions and are designed to transform the consumer's perceptions of themselves or of the product. [S218] Transformational appeals are more likely to be indicated for low-involvement goods or services. [S219] Emotional appeals are often known as a *soft-sell* approach. [S220] Because they bypass rational cognitive processing, transformational appeals are less likely to result in counter-arguing in the consumer's mind. [S221] Typology of Creative Strategies\n| **Informational** | **Description** | **Uses** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Comparative | Explicit comparison of brand and rival(s) | Use with care in competitive markets |\n| Unique Selling Proposition (USP) | Highlight a unique benefit that is meaningful to consumers | Use in categories with high levels of technological differentiation |\n| Pre-emptive | Be the first to use a common attribute or benefit | Use when differentiation is difficult or impossible |\n| Hyperbole | Gross exaggeration to highlight unique benefit | Use when brand has demonstrable point of difference |\n| Generic informational | Focus on product category | Use for new categories, new products or repositioning |\n| **Transformational** |\n| User Image | Focus on the consumer's lifestyles e.g. [S222] activities, interests, work |\n| Brand Image | Claim of superiority based on extrinsic factors such as customer perceptions, designed to give the brand a 'personality' | Use with low-tech goods where differentiation is difficult e.g. [S223] coolness, prestige |\n| Use Occasion | Focus on the brand experience, the ownership experience, the shopping experience or the consumption experience | Use with experiential goods where differentiation is difficult |\n| Generic | Focus on product class with emotional appeal | Use for new categories, new products or repositioning |",
    "[S224] In addition to determining the overall creative strategy, the advertiser also needs to consider the creative execution \u2013 which refers to the way that the message is presented. [S225] Examples of creative execution include: problem-solution formats, fear appeals, sex appeals, humour, parody, slogans or jingles, mnemonics, slice-of-life, guarantee, celebrity endorsement, testimonial, news style, scientific appeals, dramatisation and product demonstration. [S226] ### Media planning\n\nStrategic media planning consists of four key decision areas:\n\nThe traditional approach to media strategy was primarily concerned with setting objectives for message reach, weight and frequency. [S227] The contemporary approach, however, often treats the media strategy as an extension of the creative strategy. [S228] For example, L'Oreal Men's Expert promoted its skincare range on dry-cleaner hangers. [S229] When customers picked up their shirt, they found a $2 coupon and a message, \"Your shirt doesn't come with wrinkles, why should your face?\" This novel execution shows how media and creative can be integrated to generate powerful advertising. [S230] #### Setting media objectives\n\nIn terms of setting media objectives, the planner needs to address several key decisions:\n\n* Who do we want to talk to? [S231] (Target market/ audience definition)\n* How often does an audience member need to hear our message before it is noticed or achieves the desired consumer response? [S232] (Effective frequency)\n* When do audiences cease to notice the ad, or become tired of seeing the ad? [S233] (Advertising wear-out)\n\nA number of key definitions are essential for media planning purposes:\n\nWith respect to reach objectives, planners must decide what proportion of the target market need to be exposed to the advertising message. [S234] It is not always necessary to reach 100% of the target market. [S235] For new brands or brands with very low levels of awareness, it may be desirable to reach every member of the target market. [S236] However, for reminder type campaigns lower levels of reach may be all that is required. [S237] Reach objectives are normally framed in terms of a percentage of market. [S238] For example, a reach objective might read; *To reach 50% of women aged 18\u201325 years.*\n\nWith respect to frequency objectives, the planner must determine the optimal level of frequency in order to achieve the desired communications objective. [S239] Media planners often work with rules of thumb for setting frequency objectives that are based on an extensive body of evidence drawn from research findings. [S240] For example, empirical evidence suggests that the average consumer needs to be exposed to a message at least three times before they become aware of the brand information. [S241] This is sometimes known as the *3+ Rule*. [S242] To this basic benchmark of three exposures, media planners recognise that to achieve higher-level communication goals, such as persuasion and lead generation, higher levels of frequency are required. [S243] To achieve simple brand awareness, three exposures may be sufficient, but for consumers to act on that awareness, higher levels of exposure may be required. [S244] Some theorists have developed sophisticated decision models to assist with planning optimal frequency levels. [S245] Planners also need to consider the combined effects of reach and frequency (GRPs). [S246] In an intensive campaign, the schedule will utilise both broad reach (expose more people to the message) and high frequency (expose people multiple times to the message). [S247] The overall campaign weight has implications for budgets and for media selection. [S248] In an intensive campaign (heavy weight campaign), the media strategy is normally skewed towards main media, which remains the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create stable brand awareness levels. [S249] #### Media channel strategy\n\nThe first channel decision that needs to be made is whether to use a *concentrated* channel strategy or a *dispersion* channel strategy:",
    "[S250] With reach and frequency objectives firmly in place, the planner turns to determining the media mix and selecting appropriate media vehicles to carry the message. [S251] The media planner must determine the way that the advertising budget is to be allocated across the relevant media options (e.g. [S252] 50% TV; 30% Mags; 15% Digital and 5% Out-of-home). [S253] To make these decisions, the planner requires a detailed understanding of the target market and its media usage habits. [S254] Accordingly, the design of the media channel strategy requires a rich understanding of the media options and what each type of media can accomplish in terms of audience reach and engagement. [S255] **Overview of Main Advertising Media**\n| **Medium** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Television** * Excellent mass market coverage * Low relative cost (i.e. [S256] cost per thousand exposures) * Colour, sound and movement permit many creative possibilities * Good attention | * Minimal geographic & demographic audience selectivity * Cost of spots is high (in absolute terms) * Production costs are high * Clutter * Short life; ephemeral * Consumers can avoid exposure (via zapping) |\n| **Radio** * Spots are relatively inexpensive * High levels of reach and frequency * Some geographic and demographic selectivity * Message delivered in consumer's home or work environment * Short life | * Lacks vision and movement \u2013 limited creative possibilities * Non-standard rate structures |\n| **Newspapers** * Broad coverage of national markets * High level of frequency and immediacy * Message delivered in home, car or work environment * Often the last medium to be consulted before shopping * Short lead times (for production and insertion) | * Short life * Low attention * Clutter * Limited use of colour * Poor production quality |\n| **Magazines** * Able to select targeted audiences * Longer life \u2013 more opportunities to notice ads * High quality production values * Can add to brand prestige * High pass-along effect | * Expensive * Long lead times * Limited frequency |\n| **Cinema** * Some audience selectivity * Able to reach youth audiences * Captive audience \u2013 high attention * High production values and big screen viewing * Relatively low cost * Minimal clutter | * Creativity can be challenging * Minimal frequency * Limited reach |\n| Transit (*bus, train, tram, cable-car, taxi*) * Able to reach audiences when they are out shopping * Relatively low cost | * Minimal audience selectivity * Creativity can be a challenge |\n| Out-of-home (*billboards, posters, street furniture, signage, footpath art*etc.) * Able to reach mobile audiences * Good creative possibilities * Some audience selectivity (e.g. [S257] billboards near sports venues) | * Static * Creativity can be a challenge |\n| **Internet-based and digital** * Immediacy * Potential for two-way communications * Relatively low cost * Pay per number of views * Able to reach global audiences * Selective targeting | * Creativity can be a challenge * Clutter |\n\n\n#### Media audience research",
    "[S258] Media audience research is a central feature of media planning. [S259] The main purpose of media research is \"to eliminate waste in advertising by objectively analysing the media available for promoting products and services\". [S260] Identifying and profiling the audience for print media, broadcast media, cinema and online media magazine or newspaper is a specialized form of market research, often conducted on behalf of media owners. [S261] In most nations, the advertising industry, via its peak industry associations, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement for main media. [S262] The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the *industry currency* in audience measurement. [S263] Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings. [S264] In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. [S265] In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency. [S266] Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where and when media is used and the cost of data collection. [S267] All these methods involve sampling \u2013 that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population. [S268] Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process. [S269] Media research acts as form of industry regulation and the legitimacy of research methodologies and provision of audience metrics. [S270] Media owners rely on metrics of both audience size and audience quality to set advertising rates. [S271] Measures of media audience that are of especial interest to advertisers include:\n\n**Print Media**\n\n* *Circulation:* the number of copies of an issue sold (independently assessed via a circulation audit)\n* *Readership:* the total number of people who have seen or looked into a current edition of the a publication (independently measured via survey)\n* *Readership profiles:* Demographic/ psychographic and behavioural analysis of readership (sourced from Readership surveys)\n\n**Broadcast Media**\n\n* *Average audience:* The average number of people who tuned into the given time or given program, expressed in thousands or as a percentage. [S272] Also known as a *Rating* or T.A.R.P (Total Audience Rating Point). [S273] * *Audience share:* The number of listeners (or viewers) for a given channel over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the total audience potential for the total market. [S274] (The audience share is normally calculated by dividing a given channel's average audience by the average audience of all channels). [S275] * *Audience potential:* The total number of people in a given geographical area who conform to a specific definition, such as the number of people with a television (or radio) set or the total number of people aged 6\u201312 years. [S276] Population potentials are normally derived from the census figures and are used to estimate the potential market reach. [S277] * *Audience movement by session:* The number of listeners (or viewers) who switch channels during a given time period. [S278] * *Audience profile:* Analysis of audience by selected demographic, psychographic or behavioural variables. [S279] * *Cumulative audience (CUME):* The number of *different* listeners (or viewers) in a given time period; also known as *reach*.

[S284] The type and depth of freely available information varies across geographic markets. [S285] The following table provides principal sources of information for main media audience research in English speaking markets. [S286] Sources of Broadcast Audience Data *( Main English speaking markets)*\n| **Country** | **Radio** | **Television** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Australia | Commercial Radio Australia | OZTAM |\n| Britain | Radio Joint Audience Research | Broadcasters' Audience Research Board |\n| Canada | Numeris\\* | Numeris\\* |\n| India | Nielsen Media Research's RAM | TAM Media Research (a joint venture between AC Nielsen and Kantar Media) |\n| Ireland | Broadcast Authority of Ireland | TAM Ireland |\n| Malaysia\\*\\* | Nielsen (Malaysia) | Nielsen Media (US) and Kantar Media \\*\\*\\* |\n| New Zealand | Radio NZ | Think TV \\*\\*\\*\\* |\n| United States | Nielsen Audio | Nielsen |\n| South Africa | Broadcast Research Council | Broadcast Research Council |\n\n\n#### Media buying\n\nWhile it is certainly possible for advertisers to purchase advertising spots by dealing directly with media owners (e.g. [S287] newspapers, magazines or broadcast networks), in practice most media buying is purchased as part of broader negotiations. [S288] Prices depend on the advertiser's prior relationship with the network, the volume of inventory being purchased, the timing of the booking and whether the advertiser is using cross-media promotions such as product placements. [S289] Advertising spots purchased closer to airtime tend to be more expensive. [S290] Many advertisers opt to centralise their media buying through large media agencies such as Zenith or Optimedia. [S291] These large media agencies are able to exert market power through volume purchasing by buying up space for an entire year. [S292] Media agencies benefit advertisers by providing advertising units at lower rates and also through the provision of added value services such as media planning services. [S293] Buying advertising spots on national TV is very expensive. [S294] Given that most media outlets use dynamic pricing, rates vary from day to day, creating difficulties locating indicative rates. [S295] However, from time to time, trade magazines publish adrates which may be used as a general guide. [S296] The following table provides indicative advertising rates for selected popular programs on American national television networks, broadcast during prime time viewing hours. [S297] Advertising rates, selected US TV programs, 2010\n| Program/ Network | Network | Broadcast Day / Time | Rate (per 30 second spot) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *American Idol* \\* | Fox | Day not stated, prime-time | $360,000 \u2013 $490,000 |\n| *Sunday Night Football* | NBC | Sunday, prime-time | $435,000 |\n| *Family Guy* | Fox | Sunday, prime-time | $215,000 |\n| *Saturday Night College Football* | ABC | Saturday, prime-time | $140,000 |\n| *Survivor* | CBS | Thursday, prime-time | $152,000 |\n| *The Biggest Loser* | NBC | Tuesday, prime-time | $128,000 |\n| *Jay Leno* \\*\\* | NBC | Mon-Fri, Late-night | $48,800 \u2013 $65,000 |",
    "[S298] #### Pulling it all together: Media tactics and the media schedule\n\nA media schedule is a program or plan that \"identifies the media channels used in an advertising campaign, and specifies insertion or broadcast dates, positions, and duration of the messages\". [S299] Broadly, there are four basic approaches to scheduling:\n\nEmpirical support for the effectiveness of pulsing is relatively weak. [S300] However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall. [S301] With flighted schedules, the second and subsequent flights tend to build on the first flight, resulting in awareness levels similar to a continuous schedule, but often with reduced costs. [S302] A major consideration in constructing media schedules is timing. [S303] The advertiser's main is to place the advertisement as close as practical to the point where consumers make their purchase decision. [S304] For example, an advertiser who knows that a grocery buyer does a main shop on Saturday afternoons and a top-up shop on Wednesday nights, may consider TV to achieve general brand awareness, supplemented with radio spots to reach the shopper while he or she is driving to the supermarket or regular place of purchase on the days when the majority of consumers carry out their shopping. [S305] ## Measuring advertising effectiveness\n\nAdvertising is a major expense for most firms. [S306] Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. [S307] Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. [S308] Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects. [S309] The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates. [S310] Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing: Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects. [S311] * *Pre-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses\n\n* *Post-testing*: qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives. [S312] ### Pre-testing\n\nSound pre-testing exhibits the following characteristics:\n\nSpecific types of pre-testing include copy tests, projective techniques and increasingly, a diverse range of physiological and/or biometric testing methods. [S313] #### Copy testing\n\nCopy testing is testing that evaluates advertising copy and creative executions. [S314] In this section, the principal methods of copy testing are briefly discussed. [S315] ##### Mock-ups\n\nResearchers often use mock-ups of the final creative with varying degrees of finished artwork. [S316] Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. [S317] However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. [S318] Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. [S319] A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign. [S320] Types of advertising mock-ups that are used in copy testing, both print and broadcast advertising, include:\n\n\n##### Projective techniques",
    "[S321] In projective techniques, the respondent is invited to project themselves into the advertisement. [S322] There are many projective techniques including word association, sentence completion and story completion. [S323] These techniques assume that when exposed to incomplete stimuli, respondents use underlying attitudes or motivations to complete the storyline, thereby revealing their fears and aspirations that may not surface under more direct questioning. [S324] Projective techniques have been found to be very useful for evaluating concepts and generating new concepts. [S325] #### Physiological measures\n\nFor decades, researchers have been using physiological measures to study such responses to advertising. [S326] These measures include such things as pupil response, electrode mal response (GSR) and heart rate. [S327] These measures have been shown to be effective measures of attention and the strength of emotional response. [S328] With the rise of consumer neuroscience, researchers have begun to use a much wider range of measures to investigate cognitive responses as well as emotional responses. [S329] Some of the techniques used to measure consumer responses to advertising stimuli include:\n\n\n##### Pupil dilation\n\nThe amount of pupil dilation (also known as *pupillometry*) is believed to provide a relatively precise measure of the amount of mental effort associated with a task. [S330] Pupil dilation tests became a staple of advertising copy testing during the 1970s as a way to test consumers' responses to television commercials. [S331] Pupil dilation suggests a stronger interest in the stimuli and can be associated with arousal and action. [S332] Pupil dilation is not only used to study advertising, but also used to investigate product and package design. [S333] ##### Eye tracking\n\nWhile viewing an advertisement, a sensor aims a beam of infrared light at the eye and follows the movement to show the spot on which the viewer is focusing. [S334] This shows the length of time the viewer focuses on each element of the image and the general sequence used to interpret the image. [S335] Eye tracking is often used to fine tune advertising executions. [S336] Research studies suggest that eye tracking is associated with brand recognition, but less useful for brand recall. [S337] ##### Galvanic skin response (GSR)\n\nGalvanic skin response uses a device, called a galvanometer, which is very similar to a lie detector, designed to measure minute amounts of skin perspiration and electrical activity in the skin. [S338] Changes in skin response are associated with arousal and are an indicator of the advertisement's ability to capture attention. [S339] ##### Electroencephalograph (EEG)\n\nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) is a device that measures changes in brain-wave activity. [S340] EEG testing can detect emotional arousal which is difficult to detect using alternative testing methods. [S341] Arousal is an indicator of the advertisement's ability to grab attention and engage the consumer in the message. [S342] EEG testing is a cumbersome and invasive testing method which militates against routine use in advertising testing. [S343] ##### Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FmRI)\n\nFmRI is a technique that enables researchers to monitor activity in specific areas of the brain. [S344] This technique has been used to identify specific brain networks associated with pleasure and arousal associated with advertising. [S345] ### Post-testing\n\nThe aim of post-testing is to provide indicators of how well a given campaign is achieving the desired communications objectives, so that corrective action and fine-tuning can occur during the campaign as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising expenditure in order to provide benchmarks for future advertising programs. [S346] Techniques used in post-testing depend on the media employed, and may include such tests as Starch scores, day-after recall tests (DAR), campaign tracking, advertising ROI and other measures. [S347] #### Starch scores",
    "[S348] Starch scores were developed by Daniel Starch in the 1920s to evaluate the copy effectiveness of print advertisements and are still in use today. [S349] A consumer is shown a magazine page by page and subsequently asked whether they had noticed any part an advertisement. [S350] If they answer, 'Yes', the interviewer asks the respondent to indicate which parts of the ad were noticed. [S351] For each advertisement, three scores are calculated:\n\n\n#### Day-after-recall tests (DARs)\n\nDay-after-recall (DAR) tests were developed by George Gallup in the 1940s and are still used. [S352] DAR tests provide a measure of the percentage of the people who recall something specific about an ad (e.g., sales message or a visual) the day following exposure. [S353] Interviewers ask questions designed to elicit:\n\n\n#### Tracking\n\nAd tracking or campaign tracking refers to techniques used to monitor the \"in-market performance\" of advertising. [S354] Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. [S355] Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured during and after the campaign has run. [S356] A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising *wear-out*. [S357] When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. [S358] Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. [S359] When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. [S360] One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use *repetition with variation* \u2013 that is, the use of different executions of the same message. [S361] Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign. [S362] #### Advertising return on investment (ROI)\n\nAdvertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. [S363] Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. [S364] Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty. [S365] ## Careers\n\nAdvertising management is a career path in the advertising or marketing industries. [S366] Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a public relations firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. [S367] In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as *account managers* and their role involves working closely with client firms. [S368] In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns."
