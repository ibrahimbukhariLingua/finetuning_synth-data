      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how Wave Chow's team composition reflects his leadership style and what role he played in the development of the IANG immigration program.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that Wave Chow leads a team where 96% are tertiary graduates, with 70% having Master's or Doctorate degrees. That's a key point about his team composition. The sentence number S3 talks about this. So, the team's high educational background might indicate that he values expertise and high qualifications, which could be part of his leadership style\u2014maybe he focuses on hiring highly qualified individuals.\n\nThen, the question about the IANG program. The passage states in S4 that he's known as the \"Father of IANG\" and was an industry pioneer who recruited and developed IANG graduates since the program's inception. That directly answers the second part of the question. So his role was foundational, recruiting and developing graduates for the IANG immigration program.\n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the correct sentences. The team composition is in S3, and the IANG role is in S4. The other sentences might not be relevant here. Let me check again. S4 mentions \"Father of IANG\" and recruiting IANG graduates. S3 is about the team's education. The rest of the sentences talk about his qualifications, writings, and awards, which don't directly answer the question. So the citations should be [S3] and [S4]. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with two statements. The first statement about team composition and leadership style citing S3, and the second about IANG citing S4. Make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the citations inside <cite>."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how Wave Chow has integrated continuous learning and industry adaptability into his career and how that relates to his career longevity. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and find relevant information. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nStarting with the career section. Sentence S2 mentions he joined AIA in 1997 and has been there for over 23 years. That's a long tenure, which relates to career longevity. But how does that connect to continuous learning and adaptability?\n\nLooking at S3, it says he's a Senior District Director leading a team with 96% tertiary graduates. Maybe that shows he adapts to having a well-educated team, but not sure if that's directly about his own learning.\n\nS4 mentions he's the \"Father of IANG\" and recruited IANG graduates since the immigration program started. That shows he's involved in developing talent, maybe adapting to industry needs.\n\nS5 states he's aware of the need to stay abreast of industry developments and global changes. That directly points to industry adaptability.\n\nS6 says he continues to diligently improve his qualifications. That's continuous learning.\n\nS7 lists 15 professional qualifications he's obtained. That's a clear example of continuous learning.\n\nThen in the writing section, S8 mentions his columns and books, which might show he's sharing knowledge and staying relevant. But the question is about his own integration, not his contributions to others.\n\nThe personal honors are achievements but don't directly answer the question unless they're a result of his continuous learning.\n\nSo, putting it together: His continuous learning is shown by obtaining 15 qualifications (S7), and staying updated with industry changes (S5). Industry adaptability is his role in developing IANG graduates (S4) and leading a team of highly educated professionals (S3). His career longevity is his 23+ years at AIA (S2) and the awards he's received, which might be due to his adaptability and learning.\n\nNeed to make sure each statement is linked to the correct citations. Also, the answer should connect these points to career longevity. For example, his continuous learning and adaptability have allowed him to stay relevant and successful over 23 years."
