      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of resource leakage in the limitations of the PPE and how the proposed solution aligns with broader program goals.\n\nFirst, I need to find where resource leakage is mentioned. Scanning through the passage, I see [S49] mentions that another limitation of the PPE includes resource \"leakages\" due to enrollment of individuals already benefiting from other elderly-targeted programs. So that's the role of resource leakage as a limitation.\n\nNext, the proposed solution to quantify this issue. Looking at the passage, there's a point that says \"Identifying the number of beneficiaries that could be receiving support from other programs to quantify the amount of 'leakage' of resources.\" That's [S52] or [S53]? Wait, the bullet points: the third bullet says \"Identifying the number... [S53]\". So the solution is mentioned in [S53].\n\nNow, how does this align with broader program goals? The passage mentions the OECD's recommendation for harmonizing pension systems [S44], and the challenges like financial burden and demographic transition [S47][S48]. The proposed solutions include promoting retirement savings and better targeting. The goal of harmonizing and ensuring sustainability would align with quantifying leakage to prevent resource waste, ensuring funds are used effectively. The broader goals might be to create a sustainable, equitable pension system. The solution in [S53] helps in efficient resource allocation, which supports the program's sustainability and effectiveness, as mentioned in the OECD's objectives.\n\nSo the answer should state that resource leakage is a limitation because it causes inefficiency by overlapping beneficiaries. The solution to quantify leakage (S53) aligns with broader goals of efficiency and sustainability, as per the OECD's harmonization goals (S44) and addressing financial burdens (S47, S48). Need to check if the citations are correctly placed."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n# Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n\nThe **Pension Program for the Elderly** (PPE) is a safety net, noncontributory pension program administered by the federal Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) in Mexico. [S2] The program aims to expand the schemes of universal social security, by providing financial support and social protection to people 65 or older who a) do not benefit from retirement or contributory pension plans or b) receive income from retirement plans or contributory pension programs that does not exceed a certain amount determined by SEDESOL. [S3] ## The Elderly Population in Mexico and its Vulnerability\n\nFueled by an increase in life expectancy, Mexico is going through an unprecedented demographic shift which has led to a rapid increase in the aging population over the last decades. [S4] From 1.8 million people aged 65 and older in 1970, the population within this age range increased to 4.7 million in 2000 and totaled 7.5 million in 2012 (which was equivalent to approximately 6.41% of the total population in 2012). [S5] By 2050, the number of people 65 or older is expected to reach 28.7 million, which will represent just over 20% of the total population. [S6] The high vulnerability of the elderly in Mexico (especially among those that do not benefit from social security and contributory pension plans) has been documented by several sources. [S7] Data from 2010 revealed that 28.8% of people 65 and up did not have access to social security. [S8] In 2012, estimates showed that 45.8% of the population aged 65 and up lived in poverty, and that 50% of the elders within this segment of the population were still working, even after reaching the usual retirement ages. [S9] Furthermore, data have suggested that one in 5 people over 65 have difficulty in engaging in normal daily activities (e.g. [S10] bathing, getting dressed, walking), have limited access to health services, and are not culturally prone to disease prevention. [S11] All these factors, along with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases have worsened the elderly population's natural vulnerability that results from the end of a productive life and have created a greater dependence, as well as a reduction in their overall ability to function. [S12] In alignment with objective 2.4 of Mexico's National Development Plan 2013\u20132018 (and to National Strategy 2.4.2 in the Plan), the PPE seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the population aged 65 and up by providing its enrollees with a cash subsidy every two months, and by facilitating access to social security. [S13] ## History\n\nTo target the increasing number of people that reached retirement age without social security coverage (i.e. [S14] mostly those who were part of the informal sector during most of their working life), the first safety net noncontributory pension program was launched in Mexico City in 2001. [S15] Subsequently, several states throughout the country as well as the federal government have developed similar programs. [S16] As of 2011, 17 out of the 32 states in Mexico had at least one safety net program. [S17] The federal PPE is an extension of the original \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which began to operate in 2007. [S18] Originally, the program provided nationwide coverage to poor people aged at least 70 who lived in rural communities with no more than 2,500 inhabitants. [S19] However, since fiscal year 2013, the program targets all people 65 or over who live in rural or urban communities (regardless of the number of inhabitants) and who meet certain eligibility criteria. [S20] The inclusion of people in the 65\u201369 age range in both rural and urban communities was encouraged by the success of the previous \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which showed an improvement in the quality of life of its enrollees and a reduction in their physical and mental health deterioration. [S21] ## Program Characteristics\n\nPassage 2:\n[S22] The PPE caters to the elderly population in Mexico by providing cash transfers to its beneficiaries on a bimonthly basis. [S23] As of 2014, enrollees received $1,160 Mexican pesos every two months. [S24] In addition, beneficiaries participate in informative sessions on health issues and receive assistance that enables them to access services and support from institutions such as the National Institute for the Older Adults (INAPAM) and other organizations that offer occupational activities. [S25] The program's budget for 2013 totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to 0.17% of Mexico's GDP in that year (based on OECD's economic projections). [S26] The following requirements must be met by individuals in order to qualify for PPE:\n\n* Age 65 and up\n* Mexican citizens or\n* Non-nationals who have lived in Mexico for over 25 years\n* If enrolled in the elderly component of the *Oportunidades* conditional cash transfer program, they must waive their right to benefit from that program\n* For the year 2019, the amount of financial support that older adults will receive is $1,275 Mexican pesos a month, which will be delivered bimonthly\n\n### Benefits\n\nPPE enrollees receive monetary grants every two months. [S27] In addition, the program:\n\n* Provides monetary assistance for the enrollees\u2019 inclusion in the financial system (i.e. [S28] opening a bank account). [S29] This aid applies only to those who receive electronic bank transfers. [S30] * Promotes social involvement by encouraging participation of beneficiaries in personal development groups, informative sessions on topics such as healthcare, human rights, etc. [S31] * Offers social protection to its members by promoting access to healthcare services (such as those offered by Seguro Popular) and encourages the affiliation to INAPAM (which provides other benefits for the elderly)\n\n## Program Enrollment\n\nSEDESOL estimated that the total population aged 65 and over in Mexico was approximately 7.7 million in 2013. [S32] It also stated that the potential number of eligible PPE enrollees that year could range from 5.6 million to 6.2 million, depending on the source of data used (i.e. [S33] from 72.7% to 80.5% of the total population in the target age group). [S34] As of December 2013, SEDESOL reported a total of 4,248,047 beneficiaries of PPE in the country. [S35] ### Proposals according to the OECD in 2016\n\nMexico is among the three OECD countries that offer the lowest social pensions for people who are not covered by the contributory pension system. [S36] The OECD on Mexico's pension systems, published in 2016, the OECD, proposes four strategies;\n\n1.- Increase, gradually, the mandatory contributions for the pension. [S37] According to the international organization, \"a replacement rate of 50% can be achieved with a probability of 75 to 90%, contributing an average of 13 to 18% over 40 years.\"\n\n2.- Implement a pro-rata system to generate the transition from the old system to that of individual accounts. [S38] In this regard, the OECD recommends \u201csmoothing\u201d the step towards the defined contribution model in such a way that \u201cAll the rights acquired to date by the workers of the so-called 'transition generation' would be guaranteed and from then on all the workers would accumulate pension assets in the new system. [S39] Consequently, the pension benefit of a 'transition generation' worker would have two components: one based on the rights acquired under the BD formula, and the other based on the assets accumulated in the individual CD accounts. [S40] 3.- Improve the social protection network for old age through its integration and expansion. [S41] Through its study, the OECD suggests \u201cincreasing the level of non-contributory benefits in order to eradicate poverty in old age. [S42] Furthermore, it underlines the importance of the link between the non-contributory social pension (Pension for Older Adults) and the Guaranteed Minimum Pension.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key historical developments of the PPE and how the transition from the '70 and More Program' influenced its expansion to include individuals aged 65-69.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find the relevant sections. The passage has two parts, but the main info is in the first one. Let me scan through the sections.\n\nUnder the \"History\" section, there's a mention of the PPE being an extension of the \"70 and More Program\" which started in 2007. The original program targeted people aged 70 in rural areas with small populations. Then, in 2013, the program changed to include everyone 65 and over, regardless of where they lived. The transition from the '70 and More Program' allowed this expansion. The passage also states that the inclusion of 65-69 was due to the success of the previous program showing improved quality of life and reduced health deterioration.\n\nSo the key historical developments would be the launch of the first safety net program in 2001, expansion to 17 states by 2011, and the federal PPE as an extension of the '70 and More Program starting in 2007. The transition in 2013 expanded the age range from 70+ to 65+.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The '70 and More Program' is mentioned in S17 and S18. The expansion to 65-69 is in S20 and S21. The historical developments include the initial program in 2001 (S14), states developing programs (S15), 17 states by 2011 (S16), and the federal PPE as an extension (S17, S18). \n\nWait, S17 says \"As of 2011, 17 out of the 32 states in Mexico had at least one safety net program.\" Then S18 mentions the federal PPE is an extension of the '70 and More Program. The transition in 2013 is covered in S19 and S20. The influence of the '70 and More Program's success is in S21.\n\nSo the answer should mention the initial programs, the federal PPE's origin from '70 and More', the 2013 expansion to 65+, and the reasons based on the previous program's success. Citations would be S14, S15, S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21."

[S18] Originally, the program provided nationwide coverage to poor people aged at least 70 who lived in rural communities with no more than 2,500 inhabitants. [S19] However, since fiscal year 2013, the program targets all people 65 or over who live in rural or urban communities (regardless of the number of inhabitants) and who meet certain eligibility criteria. [S20] The inclusion of people in the 65\u201369 age range in both rural and urban communities was encouraged by the success of the previous \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which showed an improvement in the quality of life of its enrollees and a reduction in their physical and mental health deterioration. [S21] ## Program Characteristics\n\nPassage 2:\n[S22] The PPE caters to the elderly population in Mexico by providing cash transfers to its beneficiaries on a bimonthly basis. [S23] As of 2014, enrollees received $1,160 Mexican pesos every two months. [S24] In addition, beneficiaries participate in informative sessions on health issues and receive assistance that enables them to access services and support from institutions such as the National Institute for the Older Adults (INAPAM) and other organizations that offer occupational activities. [S25] The program's budget for 2013 totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to 0.17% of Mexico's GDP in that year (based on OECD's economic projections).

[S27] In addition, the program:\n\n* Provides monetary assistance for the enrollees\u2019 inclusion in the financial system (i.e. [S28] opening a bank account). [S29] This aid applies only to those who receive electronic bank transfers. [S30] * Promotes social involvement by encouraging participation of beneficiaries in personal development groups, informative sessions on topics such as healthcare, human rights, etc. [S31] * Offers social protection to its members by promoting access to healthcare services (such as those offered by Seguro Popular) and encourages the affiliation to INAPAM (which provides other benefits for the elderly)\n\n## Program Enrollment\n\nSEDESOL estimated that the total population aged 65 and over in Mexico was approximately 7.7 million in 2013. [S32] It also stated that the potential number of eligible PPE enrollees that year could range from 5.6 million to 6.2 million, depending on the source of data used (i.e. [S33] from 72.7% to 80.5% of the total population in the target age group). [S34] As of December 2013, SEDESOL reported a total of 4,248,047 beneficiaries of PPE in the country. [S35] ### Proposals according to the OECD in 2016\n\nMexico is among the three OECD countries that offer the lowest social pensions for people who are not covered by the contributory pension system. [S36] The OECD on Mexico's pension systems, published in 2016, the OECD, proposes four strategies;\n\n1.- Increase, gradually, the mandatory contributions for the pension. [S37] According to the international organization, \"a replacement rate of 50% can be achieved with a probability of 75 to 90%, contributing an average of 13 to 18% over 40 years.\"\n\n2.- Implement a pro-rata system to generate the transition from the old system to that of individual accounts. [S38] In this regard, the OECD recommends \u201csmoothing\u201d the step towards the defined contribution model in such a way that \u201cAll the rights acquired to date by the workers of the so-called 'transition generation' would be guaranteed and from then on all the workers would accumulate pension assets in the new system. [S39] Consequently, the pension benefit of a 'transition generation' worker would have two components: one based on the rights acquired under the BD formula, and the other based on the assets accumulated in the individual CD accounts. [S40] 3.- Improve the social protection network for old age through its integration and expansion. [S41] Through its study, the OECD suggests \u201cincreasing the level of non-contributory benefits in order to eradicate poverty in old age.

        "[S1] Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n# Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n\nThe **Pension Program for the Elderly** (PPE) is a safety net, noncontributory pension program administered by the federal Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) in Mexico. [S2] The program aims to expand the schemes of universal social security, by providing financial support and social protection to people 65 or older who a) do not benefit from retirement or contributory pension plans or b) receive income from retirement plans or contributory pension programs that does not exceed a certain amount determined by SEDESOL. [S3] ## The Elderly Population in Mexico and its Vulnerability\n\nFueled by an increase in life expectancy, Mexico is going through an unprecedented demographic shift which has led to a rapid increase in the aging population over the last decades. [S4] From 1.8 million people aged 65 and older in 1970, the population within this age range increased to 4.7 million in 2000 and totaled 7.5 million in 2012 (which was equivalent to approximately 6.41% of the total population in 2012). [S5] By 2050, the number of people 65 or older is expected to reach 28.7 million, which will represent just over 20% of the total population. [S6] The high vulnerability of the elderly in Mexico (especially among those that do not benefit from social security and contributory pension plans) has been documented by several sources. [S7] Data from 2010 revealed that 28.8% of people 65 and up did not have access to social security. [S8] In 2012, estimates showed that 45.8% of the population aged 65 and up lived in poverty, and that 50% of the elders within this segment of the population were still working, even after reaching the usual retirement ages. [S9] Furthermore, data have suggested that one in 5 people over 65 have difficulty in engaging in normal daily activities (e.g. [S10] bathing, getting dressed, walking), have limited access to health services, and are not culturally prone to disease prevention. [S11] All these factors, along with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases have worsened the elderly population's natural vulnerability that results from the end of a productive life and have created a greater dependence, as well as a reduction in their overall ability to function. [S12] In alignment with objective 2.4 of Mexico's National Development Plan 2013\u20132018 (and to National Strategy 2.4.2 in the Plan), the PPE seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the population aged 65 and up by providing its enrollees with a cash subsidy every two months, and by facilitating access to social security. [S13] ## History\n\nTo target the increasing number of people that reached retirement age without social security coverage (i.e. [S14] mostly those who were part of the informal sector during most of their working life), the first safety net noncontributory pension program was launched in Mexico City in 2001. [S15] Subsequently, several states throughout the country as well as the federal government have developed similar programs. [S16] As of 2011, 17 out of the 32 states in Mexico had at least one safety net program. [S17] The federal PPE is an extension of the original \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which began to operate in 2007.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the PPE's eligibility criteria and financial structure reflect its objective of reducing poverty among the elderly, and what role the OECD's 2016 recommendations play in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections about the PPE. Let me start by identifying the parts that discuss eligibility criteria and financial structure.\n\nLooking at the \"Program Characteristics\" section, there's a list of requirements: age 65 and up, Mexican citizens or non-nationals with 25+ years in Mexico, and waiving Oportunidades benefits. These criteria target those without other pensions, which aligns with reducing poverty by focusing on the most vulnerable. The financial structure includes cash transfers, like $1,160 pesos every two months, which provides direct financial support. The budget info (26 billion pesos, 0.17% of GDP) shows the financial commitment. Also, the mention of social services and health access ties into broader support beyond just money.\n\nNext, the OECD's 2016 recommendations. The passage states that Mexico has the lowest social pensions among OECD countries. The OECD proposed increasing contributions, a pro-rata system for transitioning pensions, improving social protection networks, and raising non-contributory benefits to eradicate elderly poverty. The PPE's focus on non-contributory support (since it's for those without contributory pensions) seems to align with the OECD's suggestion to increase non-contributory benefits. The OECD's emphasis on integrating social protection networks might relate to the PPE's inclusion of health services and INAPAM access.\n\nNow, I need to connect these points. The eligibility criteria ensure that those most in need (without other pensions) are targeted, which directly addresses poverty. The financial structure provides regular cash transfers, which is a direct way to reduce poverty. The OECD's recommendations likely influenced the PPE's design by highlighting the need for non-contributory benefits and integrated social protection, which the PPE does through its cash transfers and additional services.\n\nI should check the citations. The eligibility criteria are in S2, S22, S26, S27, S28, S29, S30, S31, S32, S33, S34, S35. The financial structure is in S23, S25, S26. The OECD part is in S36, S37, S38, S39, S40, S41, S42. Need to make sure each statement cites the correct sentences.\n\nWait, the question also asks about the role of OECD's 2016 recommendations. The passage mentions that the OECD proposed increasing non-contributory benefits, which the PPE does. So the OECD's recommendations would be a factor in shaping the PPE's approach, possibly influencing its structure to align with their suggestions.\n\nI need to structure the answer with statements, each citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each part of the question is addressed: eligibility criteria, financial structure, and OECD's role."

[S35] ### Proposals according to the OECD in 2016\n\nMexico is among the three OECD countries that offer the lowest social pensions for people who are not covered by the contributory pension system. [S36] The OECD on Mexico's pension systems, published in 2016, the OECD, proposes four strategies;\n\n1.- Increase, gradually, the mandatory contributions for the pension. [S37] According to the international organization, \"a replacement rate of 50% can be achieved with a probability of 75 to 90%, contributing an average of 13 to 18% over 40 years.\"\n\n2.- Implement a pro-rata system to generate the transition from the old system to that of individual accounts. [S38] In this regard, the OECD recommends \u201csmoothing\u201d the step towards the defined contribution model in such a way that \u201cAll the rights acquired to date by the workers of the so-called 'transition generation' would be guaranteed and from then on all the workers would accumulate pension assets in the new system. [S39] Consequently, the pension benefit of a 'transition generation' worker would have two components: one based on the rights acquired under the BD formula, and the other based on the assets accumulated in the individual CD accounts. [S40] 3.- Improve the social protection network for old age through its integration and expansion. [S41] Through its study, the OECD suggests \u201cincreasing the level of non-contributory benefits in order to eradicate poverty in old age. [S42] Furthermore, it underlines the importance of the link between the non-contributory social pension (Pension for Older Adults) and the Guaranteed Minimum Pension."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the program characteristics of the PPE that go beyond financial assistance and how they contribute to social and health outcomes. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sections. The \"Program Characteristics\" section in Passage 2 seems relevant. Let me check there.\n\nLooking at the sentences in Passage 2, S22 mentions cash transfers every two months. But the question is about characteristics beyond financial assistance. So I need to find other points. \n\nS24 talks about informative sessions on health issues and assistance to access services from INAPAM and other organizations. That's a non-financial aspect. Then S25 mentions participation in personal development groups and informative sessions on healthcare, human rights, etc. Also, promoting access to healthcare services and INAPAM affiliation. These are social and health-related components.\n\nAnother point is S28 and S29 about helping open bank accounts for electronic transfers. That's a service to integrate them into the financial system, which could have social benefits. \n\nSo the program characteristics beyond financial assistance include health informative sessions, access to healthcare services, social participation through groups, and financial inclusion via bank accounts. \n\nNow, how do these contribute to social and health outcomes? The informative sessions likely improve health knowledge, leading to better health practices. Access to healthcare services would directly improve health outcomes. Social participation can enhance mental well-being and reduce isolation. Financial inclusion might lead to better economic stability, which indirectly affects health.\n\nI need to cite the relevant sentences. For the characteristics: S24, S25, S28, S29. For the contributions, maybe S25's mention of promoting access to healthcare and S24's health sessions. Also, S31 about social involvement. \n\nWait, the user wants the contributions to social and health outcomes. So the answer should link each characteristic to its impact. For example, health sessions and access to services improve health, social groups improve social outcomes. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement and citations. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other points. The OECD proposals in S36-S42 are about policy recommendations, not the program's characteristics, so probably not relevant here. \n\nSo the key sentences are S22 (cash transfers, but that's financial), S24 (health sessions and access to services), S25 (social groups, healthcare access, INAPAM), S28/S29 (bank accounts). \n\nTherefore, the answer should list these characteristics with their citations and explain their contributions."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S1] Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n# Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n\nThe **Pension Program for the Elderly** (PPE) is a safety net, noncontributory pension program administered by the federal Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) in Mexico. [S2] The program aims to expand the schemes of universal social security, by providing financial support and social protection to people 65 or older who a) do not benefit from retirement or contributory pension plans or b) receive income from retirement plans or contributory pension programs that does not exceed a certain amount determined by SEDESOL. [S3] ## The Elderly Population in Mexico and its Vulnerability\n\nFueled by an increase in life expectancy, Mexico is going through an unprecedented demographic shift which has led to a rapid increase in the aging population over the last decades. [S4] From 1.8 million people aged 65 and older in 1970, the population within this age range increased to 4.7 million in 2000 and totaled 7.5 million in 2012 (which was equivalent to approximately 6.41% of the total population in 2012). [S5] By 2050, the number of people 65 or older is expected to reach 28.7 million, which will represent just over 20% of the total population. [S6] The high vulnerability of the elderly in Mexico (especially among those that do not benefit from social security and contributory pension plans) has been documented by several sources. [S7] Data from 2010 revealed that 28.8% of people 65 and up did not have access to social security. [S8] In 2012, estimates showed that 45.8% of the population aged 65 and up lived in poverty, and that 50% of the elders within this segment of the population were still working, even after reaching the usual retirement ages. [S9] Furthermore, data have suggested that one in 5 people over 65 have difficulty in engaging in normal daily activities (e.g. [S10] bathing, getting dressed, walking), have limited access to health services, and are not culturally prone to disease prevention. [S11] All these factors, along with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases have worsened the elderly population's natural vulnerability that results from the end of a productive life and have created a greater dependence, as well as a reduction in their overall ability to function. [S12] In alignment with objective 2.4 of Mexico's National Development Plan 2013\u20132018 (and to National Strategy 2.4.2 in the Plan), the PPE seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the population aged 65 and up by providing its enrollees with a cash subsidy every two months, and by facilitating access to social security. [S13] ## History\n\nTo target the increasing number of people that reached retirement age without social security coverage (i.e. [S14] mostly those who were part of the informal sector during most of their working life), the first safety net noncontributory pension program was launched in Mexico City in 2001. [S15] Subsequently, several states throughout the country as well as the federal government have developed similar programs. [S16] As of 2011, 17 out of the 32 states in Mexico had at least one safety net program. [S17] The federal PPE is an extension of the original \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which began to operate in 2007. [S18] Originally, the program provided nationwide coverage to poor people aged at least 70 who lived in rural communities with no more than 2,500 inhabitants. [S19] However, since fiscal year 2013, the program targets all people 65 or over who live in rural or urban communities (regardless of the number of inhabitants) and who meet certain eligibility criteria. [S20] The inclusion of people in the 65\u201369 age range in both rural and urban communities was encouraged by the success of the previous \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which showed an improvement in the quality of life of its enrollees and a reduction in their physical and mental health deterioration. [S21] ## Program Characteristics\n\nPassage 2:\n[S22] The PPE caters to the elderly population in Mexico by providing cash transfers to its beneficiaries on a bimonthly basis. [S23] As of 2014, enrollees received $1,160 Mexican pesos every two months. [S24] In addition, beneficiaries participate in informative sessions on health issues and receive assistance that enables them to access services and support from institutions such as the National Institute for the Older Adults (INAPAM) and other organizations that offer occupational activities. [S25] The program's budget for 2013 totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to 0.17% of Mexico's GDP in that year (based on OECD's economic projections). [S26] The following requirements must be met by individuals in order to qualify for PPE:\n\n* Age 65 and up\n* Mexican citizens or\n* Non-nationals who have lived in Mexico for over 25 years\n* If enrolled in the elderly component of the *Oportunidades* conditional cash transfer program, they must waive their right to benefit from that program\n* For the year 2019, the amount of financial support that older adults will receive is $1,275 Mexican pesos a month, which will be delivered bimonthly\n\n### Benefits\n\nPPE enrollees receive monetary grants every two months. [S27] In addition, the program:\n\n* Provides monetary assistance for the enrollees\u2019 inclusion in the financial system (i.e. [S28] opening a bank account). [S29] This aid applies only to those who receive electronic bank transfers. [S30] * Promotes social involvement by encouraging participation of beneficiaries in personal development groups, informative sessions on topics such as healthcare, human rights, etc. [S31] * Offers social protection to its members by promoting access to healthcare services (such as those offered by Seguro Popular) and encourages the affiliation to INAPAM (which provides other benefits for the elderly)\n\n## Program Enrollment\n\nSEDESOL estimated that the total population aged 65 and over in Mexico was approximately 7.7 million in 2013. [S32] It also stated that the potential number of eligible PPE enrollees that year could range from 5.6 million to 6.2 million, depending on the source of data used (i.e. [S33] from 72.7% to 80.5% of the total population in the target age group).

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the OECD's 2016 proposal for a pro-rata system and transition to individual accounts relates to the PPE's current structure and objectives. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions the OECD's 2016 proposals in the section titled \"Proposals according to the OECD in 2016\". Specifically, point 2 talks about implementing a pro-rata system to transition from the old system to individual accounts. The pro-rata system is described as a way to \"smooth\" the step towards the defined contribution model, ensuring that rights acquired by the transition generation are guaranteed, and then moving to individual accounts.\n\nNow, the PPE's current structure and objectives are outlined in the earlier sections. The PPE is a noncontributory pension program aimed at providing financial support to the elderly who don't have access to contributory pensions. Its objectives include reducing vulnerability by offering cash subsidies and facilitating access to social security.\n\nThe connection here would be that the OECD's pro-rata system and transition to individual accounts might influence the PPE's approach. However, the PPE is a noncontributory program, meaning it doesn't rely on contributions. The OECD's proposal is about transitioning to individual accounts, which are contributory. So, perhaps the PPE's current structure isn't directly based on that proposal, but the OECD's recommendations might aim to complement or integrate with existing programs like the PPE. \n\nLooking at the citations, the OECD's proposal is mentioned in [S38], [S39], [S40]. The PPE's objectives are in [S2], [S12], [S22], etc. The answer should link the OECD's pro-rata system to the PPE's structure. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state a direct relation. It might be that the OECD's proposal is part of a broader pension reform that could affect the PPE's role. For example, if the transition to individual accounts is part of a larger system, the PPE might still serve as a safety net for those not covered by the new system. \n\nBut since the question is about the relation, I need to check if the context provides any direct links. The passage mentions that the OECD's proposal includes a pro-rata system to transition to individual accounts, which would affect the contributory pension system. The PPE is a noncontributory program, so maybe the OECD's proposal is separate but related in that they both aim to improve elderly support. However, the answer should be based strictly on the given text. \n\nThe supporting context doesn't explicitly state how the OECD's proposal relates to the PPE's structure. It only mentions the OECD's proposals in the context of Mexico's pension systems. Therefore, the answer might be that the OECD's proposal is part of a broader strategy that could influence the PPE's objectives, but the text doesn't directly link them. However, since the user wants citations, I need to check if any sentences in the passage connect them. \n\nLooking again, the PPE's objective is to reduce vulnerability by providing cash subsidies. The OECD's proposal includes improving social protection networks, which might align with the PPE's goals. But the specific mention of the pro-rata system and individual accounts is in the OECD's recommendations for the contributory system, not directly the PPE. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the OECD's 2016 proposal for a pro-rata system and transition to individual accounts is part of a broader pension reform that aims to enhance the transition to individual accounts, which might complement the PPE's role as a noncontributory safety net. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state a direct relation, so the answer should reflect that based on the given context. \n\nBut since the user requires citations, I need to see if any sentences in the passage link them. The OECD's proposal is in [S38]-[S40], and the PPE's objectives are in [S2], [S12], etc. There's no direct citation linking them, so the answer might be that the OECD's proposal relates to the broader pension system, while the PPE's structure is a separate noncontributory program. However, the question is about the relation, so perhaps the answer is that the OECD's proposal aims to transition to individual accounts, which could affect the contributory part, while the PPE remains a noncontributory program. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer would state that the OECD's 2016 proposal for a pro-rata system and transition to individual accounts is part of a strategy to reform the pension system, which may influence the structure of contributory pensions, while the PPE's current structure focuses on noncontributory support. However, the exact relation isn't detailed in the passage, so the answer should be based on the provided citations without assuming additional information."

The user is asking about the key challenges facing Mexico's Pension Program for the Elderly (PPE) in terms of financial sustainability and how the OECD's recommendation for harmonizing pension systems relates to these challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several points. Starting with the challenges: \n\nFrom the context, [S46] mentions challenges, and then [S47] talks about the limitation of noncontributory programs being subject to government funding. Specifically for Mexico, [S47] cites Levy & Schady and Aguila, pointing out the future financial burden from the PPE's expansion in coverage and beneficiaries. [S48] adds that the number of beneficiaries will rise due to demographic transition. [S49] mentions resource \"leakages\" from enrolling people already in other elderly programs.\n\nSo the key challenges here are the financial burden from expansion, demographic factors increasing beneficiaries, and resource leakages. \n\nNow, the OECD's recommendation is in [S44], which talks about harmonizing rules for all pension plans to create a national system. The harmonization includes private, public, and special regimes as per [S45]. \n\nHow does this relate to the challenges? The OECD's suggestion to harmonize might address the fragmentation mentioned in [S43], which could help in managing the financial sustainability. By having a unified system, maybe it's easier to manage funding, reduce leakages, and handle the increasing number of beneficiaries. But the context doesn't explicitly link harmonization to each challenge. However, the user is asking for the relation, so I need to infer that harmonizing could mitigate the challenges by creating a more cohesive system, possibly improving efficiency and reducing overlaps (like leakages) and better managing the financial load through a unified approach.\n\nSo the answer should list the challenges with their citations and then explain the OECD's recommendation and its relation. The citations for challenges are [S47][S48][S49]. The OECD's part is [S44][S45]. The relation is implied through addressing fragmentation and creating a unified system, which would help with the mentioned challenges."

    "[S1] Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n# Pension Program for the Elderly (Mexico)\n\n\n\nThe **Pension Program for the Elderly** (PPE) is a safety net, noncontributory pension program administered by the federal Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL) in Mexico. [S2] The program aims to expand the schemes of universal social security, by providing financial support and social protection to people 65 or older who a) do not benefit from retirement or contributory pension plans or b) receive income from retirement plans or contributory pension programs that does not exceed a certain amount determined by SEDESOL. [S3] ## The Elderly Population in Mexico and its Vulnerability\n\nFueled by an increase in life expectancy, Mexico is going through an unprecedented demographic shift which has led to a rapid increase in the aging population over the last decades. [S4] From 1.8 million people aged 65 and older in 1970, the population within this age range increased to 4.7 million in 2000 and totaled 7.5 million in 2012 (which was equivalent to approximately 6.41% of the total population in 2012). [S5] By 2050, the number of people 65 or older is expected to reach 28.7 million, which will represent just over 20% of the total population. [S6] The high vulnerability of the elderly in Mexico (especially among those that do not benefit from social security and contributory pension plans) has been documented by several sources. [S7] Data from 2010 revealed that 28.8% of people 65 and up did not have access to social security. [S8] In 2012, estimates showed that 45.8% of the population aged 65 and up lived in poverty, and that 50% of the elders within this segment of the population were still working, even after reaching the usual retirement ages. [S9] Furthermore, data have suggested that one in 5 people over 65 have difficulty in engaging in normal daily activities (e.g. [S10] bathing, getting dressed, walking), have limited access to health services, and are not culturally prone to disease prevention. [S11] All these factors, along with a rise in the incidence of chronic diseases have worsened the elderly population's natural vulnerability that results from the end of a productive life and have created a greater dependence, as well as a reduction in their overall ability to function. [S12] In alignment with objective 2.4 of Mexico's National Development Plan 2013\u20132018 (and to National Strategy 2.4.2 in the Plan), the PPE seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the population aged 65 and up by providing its enrollees with a cash subsidy every two months, and by facilitating access to social security. [S13] ## History\n\nTo target the increasing number of people that reached retirement age without social security coverage (i.e. [S14] mostly those who were part of the informal sector during most of their working life), the first safety net noncontributory pension program was launched in Mexico City in 2001. [S15] Subsequently, several states throughout the country as well as the federal government have developed similar programs. [S16] As of 2011, 17 out of the 32 states in Mexico had at least one safety net program. [S17] The federal PPE is an extension of the original \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which began to operate in 2007. [S18] Originally, the program provided nationwide coverage to poor people aged at least 70 who lived in rural communities with no more than 2,500 inhabitants. [S19] However, since fiscal year 2013, the program targets all people 65 or over who live in rural or urban communities (regardless of the number of inhabitants) and who meet certain eligibility criteria. [S20] The inclusion of people in the 65\u201369 age range in both rural and urban communities was encouraged by the success of the previous \u201c70 and More Program\u201d which showed an improvement in the quality of life of its enrollees and a reduction in their physical and mental health deterioration. [S21] ## Program Characteristics",
    "[S22] The PPE caters to the elderly population in Mexico by providing cash transfers to its beneficiaries on a bimonthly basis. [S23] As of 2014, enrollees received $1,160 Mexican pesos every two months. [S24] In addition, beneficiaries participate in informative sessions on health issues and receive assistance that enables them to access services and support from institutions such as the National Institute for the Older Adults (INAPAM) and other organizations that offer occupational activities. [S25] The program's budget for 2013 totaled 26 billion Mexican pesos, equivalent to 0.17% of Mexico's GDP in that year (based on OECD's economic projections). [S26] The following requirements must be met by individuals in order to qualify for PPE:\n\n* Age 65 and up\n* Mexican citizens or\n* Non-nationals who have lived in Mexico for over 25 years\n* If enrolled in the elderly component of the *Oportunidades* conditional cash transfer program, they must waive their right to benefit from that program\n* For the year 2019, the amount of financial support that older adults will receive is $1,275 Mexican pesos a month, which will be delivered bimonthly\n\n### Benefits\n\nPPE enrollees receive monetary grants every two months. [S27] In addition, the program:\n\n* Provides monetary assistance for the enrollees\u2019 inclusion in the financial system (i.e. [S28] opening a bank account). [S29] This aid applies only to those who receive electronic bank transfers. [S30] * Promotes social involvement by encouraging participation of beneficiaries in personal development groups, informative sessions on topics such as healthcare, human rights, etc. [S31] * Offers social protection to its members by promoting access to healthcare services (such as those offered by Seguro Popular) and encourages the affiliation to INAPAM (which provides other benefits for the elderly)\n\n## Program Enrollment\n\nSEDESOL estimated that the total population aged 65 and over in Mexico was approximately 7.7 million in 2013. [S32] It also stated that the potential number of eligible PPE enrollees that year could range from 5.6 million to 6.2 million, depending on the source of data used (i.e. [S33] from 72.7% to 80.5% of the total population in the target age group). [S34] As of December 2013, SEDESOL reported a total of 4,248,047 beneficiaries of PPE in the country. [S35] ### Proposals according to the OECD in 2016\n\nMexico is among the three OECD countries that offer the lowest social pensions for people who are not covered by the contributory pension system. [S36] The OECD on Mexico's pension systems, published in 2016, the OECD, proposes four strategies;\n\n1.- Increase, gradually, the mandatory contributions for the pension. [S37] According to the international organization, \"a replacement rate of 50% can be achieved with a probability of 75 to 90%, contributing an average of 13 to 18% over 40 years.\"\n\n2.- Implement a pro-rata system to generate the transition from the old system to that of individual accounts. [S38] In this regard, the OECD recommends \u201csmoothing\u201d the step towards the defined contribution model in such a way that \u201cAll the rights acquired to date by the workers of the so-called 'transition generation' would be guaranteed and from then on all the workers would accumulate pension assets in the new system. [S39] Consequently, the pension benefit of a 'transition generation' worker would have two components: one based on the rights acquired under the BD formula, and the other based on the assets accumulated in the individual CD accounts. [S40] 3.- Improve the social protection network for old age through its integration and expansion. [S41] Through its study, the OECD suggests \u201cincreasing the level of non-contributory benefits in order to eradicate poverty in old age. [S42] Furthermore, it underlines the importance of the link between the non-contributory social pension (Pension for Older Adults) and the Guaranteed Minimum Pension.",
    "[S43] 4.- Homogenize the retirement savings system, which until now has been fragmented. [S44] The OECD recommends \u201charmonizing the rules for all pension plans, with the fundamental objective of establishing a national pension system that is the same for all Mexicans. [S45] This harmonization must include pension plans for workers in the private and public sectors, as well as special regimes (for states, municipalities, and universities, among others) \u201d. [S46] ## Challenges\n\nAlthough noncontributory pension programs have proved effective in different countries as a strategy to reduce poverty of the elder population without social security coverage or employer-based pensions, their greatest limitation is that they are subject to government funding availability. [S47] In the case of Mexico, Levy & Schady and Aguila, note that the expected future financial burden associated with the recent expansion of the PPE in terms of geographical coverage and number of beneficiaries represents the program's main challenge. [S48] This is because the number of eligible beneficiaries will continue to rise in the upcoming years, as a result of Mexico's demographic transition. [S49] Another limitation of the PPE includes the possibility of resource \u201cleakages\u201d due to the enrollment of individuals that already benefit from other programs that target the elderly. [S50] Proposed measures to offset such challenges, are summarized below:\n\n* Designing mechanisms that promote retirement savings by covering future workforce through mandatory inclusion of workers in the social security system, regardless of whether they are part of the formal or the informal sector. [S51] * Increasing incentives to encourage the creation of a \u201cretirement savings culture\u201d by designing products that address vulnerable elders, and develop alternatives with preferential tax treatment. [S52] * Identifying the number of beneficiaries that could be receiving support from other programs to quantify the amount of \u201cleakage\u201d of resources. [S53] * Devise a new cost-based targeting method, that takes population growth and needs, budget constraints and the program's operation capacity into consideration."
