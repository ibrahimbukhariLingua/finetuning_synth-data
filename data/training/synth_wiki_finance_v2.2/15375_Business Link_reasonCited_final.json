      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S54] The service was evaluated on a number of occasions. [S55] These assessments generally found positive impacts of Business Link on companies that received advice. [S56] However, some commentators worried about the cost of Business Link and the variability of advice. [S57] Some of the Business Links were chosen to provide more intensive support to fewer companies and these seemed to do comparatively well.

[S60] It was then abolished along with the regional development agencies, although the Business Link website and the national helpline continued to operate. [S61] Local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) were expected to drive regional economic growth in the absence of the Business Link regional advisory service.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the regional and international counterparts to Business Link and how the transition to Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) affected regional economic support in the UK.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant parts of the passage. The passage mentions that Business Link was replaced by LEPs. Looking at the supporting context, there's a section under \"Similar services\" that lists the regional counterparts. Specifically, [S75] states that Business Link only operated in England, and the other UK regions have their own services: Business Gateway in Scotland, NIbusinessinfo.co.uk in Northern Ireland, and Business Wales. Also, it mentions that most OECD countries have similar services, like SBDC in the US and ALMI in Sweden.\n\nFor the second part about the transition to LEPs, the passage says in [S61] that LEPs were expected to drive regional economic growth after Business Link's abolition. Also, [S70] and [S71] mention that the Cameron-Clegg coalition planned to abolish regional programs, replacing them with LEPs, while keeping the national website and phone service. However, the website was later replaced by Gov.uk. The transition might have affected the provision by shifting responsibility to LEPs, but the passage doesn't explicitly state if it improved or hindered support. The evaluations of Business Link showed mixed results, but the exact impact of LEPs isn't detailed here.\n\nSo, the answer should list the counterparts from the passage and note that LEPs took over, but the passage doesn't provide detailed info on the effect of the transition. The citations would be [S75], [S76], [S78] for the counterparts, and [S61], [S70], [S71] for the transition part."

      "question": "What were the key challenges in the initial creation of Business Link, and how did the tension between the government and private sector influence its development?",
      "answer": "<statement>The initial creation of Business Link faced challenges including unsuccessful attempts to collaborate with the private sector, particularly the British Chambers of Commerce, which Heseltine claimed failed to establish a combined advisory service and viewed Business Link as an intrusion into their \"fiefdom.\" This tension highlighted a disconnect between government objectives and private sector priorities.<cite>[S26][S28][S32][S34]</cite></statement><statement>Additionally, the rollout of Business Link was slower than anticipated due to bureaucratic hurdles, such as evaluations by a National Assessment Panel, mandatory ISO 9001 and Investors in People accreditations, and the requirement for operators to secure 25% of income from non-government sources within five years, which complicated implementation.<cite>[S35][S36][S37][S48]</cite></statement><statement>The tension between the government and private sector, coupled with political resistance from both left and right wings of politics, influenced Business Link's development. Heseltine faced skepticism about government intervention in the capitalist system, necessitating efforts to justify the initiative as a supportive rather than interfering mechanism.<cite>[S21][S22][S23][S25]</cite></statement>",
      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S26] Initially, Heseltine approached the private sector to deliver a Business Link type service, specifically the British Chambers of Commerce. [S27] However, these meetings were unsuccessful. [S28] The reasons for this failure are disputed, however Heseltine stated that Chambers \"should have set up this combined advisory service. [S29] They should have gone to Government and said, look you've got all these services, work with us and create the one stop shop. [S30] That's what they should have done. [S31] We did it for them. [S32] I think they regarded Business Link as an intrusion into their fiefdom. [S33] But the reason we created Business Link was because the Chambers weren't doing a good enough job. [S34] So there was tension there from the beginning.\"\n\n\n### Creation and evolution of the network\n\nThe Department of Trade (DTI) predicted 54 Business Links would launch by the end of 1993. [S35] Progress was much slower than anticipated due to each bidder and proposal having to be evaluated by a National Assessment Panel. [S36] Achieving and maintaining the ISO 9001 Quality Management Standard and Investors in People accreditation was a mandatory requirement, and each successful Business Link operator was granted a three-year license. [S37] By the end of 1993 (during which time the government spent some \u00a33m on the programme), only three branches of the service had been formed. [S38] The first opened in Leicester on 27 September 1993, with others following in Birmingham and Congleton. [S39] Halfway through 1994 only 21 Business Link operators were in place. [S40] At the end of 1996 the national roll-out was complete.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 At its peak, Business Link operated through 89 regional offices employing 650 personal business advisors. [S41] In 2005, administration of Business Link services was transferred to the regional development agencies, who mostly chose to contract business support out to private companies. [S42] ### Reception\n\nThe Business Link network employed personal business advisors (PBAs), who worked primarily with businesses that employed between 10 and 249 people (small and medium sized enterprises). [S43] In February 1996, the Institute of Directors published a research paper stating that their members were worried about the declared focus on growth businesses employing between 10 and 249, because this might hurt smaller businesses and disadvantage start ups. [S44] However, contrary to popular belief at the time, businesses of all sizes were able to access Business Link services from the start. [S45] In November 1996, Richard Page, the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy, stated in the House of Commons that he was \"disturbed to hear that the impression has been given that we are not there to help all businesses irrespective of size. [S46] My clear message is that Business Link is there to help any business man or woman, irrespective of size of company, because from little acorns grow the big oak trees\". [S47] This contradiction may be explained by the DTI directive requiring the individual new Business Link partnerships to generate at least 25% of their income from outside central government within five years of launch, with the express advice that the most likely source would be the end consumers. [S48] As a result, the Business Links wanted their PBAs to work with growth-oriented businesses but this proved difficult to enforce and implement. [S49] PBAs were recruited from those who ran businesses. [S50] At first some were self-employed earning commission but this did not prove to be self-sustaining. [S51] ## Services\n\n\n### Regional network\n\nBusiness Link's face-to-face service operated on a regional basis across England and was funded by the relevant regional development agencies (RDAs). [S52] The service used an IDBT (information, diagnostic, brokerage and transaction) model to advise businesses. [S53] Regional Business Links ran a variety of events and workshops on topical issues and general business skills.\n\nPassage 2:\n[S1] Business Link\n\n\n# Business Link\n\n\n\n**Business Link** was a government-funded business advice and guidance service established in England in 1992. [S2] It consisted of an online portal managed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline. [S3] The service's network of local and regional advisors (under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) was axed in 2011. [S4] The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012, although migration of all services to Gov.uk branding took several years and the telephone helpline was retained for some time. [S5] This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988. [S6] ## Origins and launch\n\nThe concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry. [S7] The initiative was at first referred to as \"One Stop Shop\", and was launched as Business Link in December 1992. [S8] It replaced a number of services which were considered to be fragmented, such as the Department of Employment's 'Small business development service'. [S9] At the time, research led the government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. [S10] These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for the new service. [S11] Previously, the Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. [S12] This government-funded scheme was designed to encourage take-up of external advice (consultancy) by small businesses, by offering grant incentives. [S13] During this three-year period \u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S14] applications were received from 135,700 businesses. [S15] A Wren and Storey report concluded that \u00a31,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by \u00a330,000 and created a new job. [S16] An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take-up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. [S17] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S18] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S19] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S20] We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\"\n\n\n### Resistance\n\nDespite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded \"one stop shop\" immediately hit political resistance. [S21] Reflecting on this period in 2011, Heseltine stated that \"you would have the left wing, which wouldn't have any real interest in effective management of the capitalist system. [S22] And you would have a very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. [S23] In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative back benchers so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. [S24] What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers. [S25] Now I wasn't in favour of certainly the latter, but once I had done the presentations, I had no complaints.\"",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key challenges in the initial creation of Business Link and how the tension between the government and private sector influenced its development. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. There are two passages here. Let me start by scanning each part for relevant information.\n\nIn Passage 1, there's a section titled \"Creation and evolution of the network\" which mentions that the DTI predicted 54 Business Links by 1993, but progress was slow. The reasons given include the evaluation by a National Assessment Panel, needing ISO 9001 and Investors in People accreditation, and the three-year license. Also, only three branches were formed by the end of 1993. That's part of the challenges. But the user is asking about the initial creation, so maybe the early issues.\n\nThen there's the part about Heseltine approaching the private sector, specifically the British Chambers of Commerce, but the meetings were unsuccessful. The reasons for failure are disputed, but Heseltine says the Chambers should have set up the service themselves. He mentions they saw Business Link as an intrusion into their fiefdom, and there was tension because the Chambers weren't doing a good enough job. This seems like a key challenge and the tension between government and private sector.\n\nIn Passage 2, under \"Origins and launch,\" it says the concept was established by Heseltine in 1992. The initial name was \"One Stop Shop.\" Also, there's mention of political resistance, both from the left and right. The left didn't care about effective management, and the right thought government intervention was unattractive. Heseltine had to present to Conservative backbenchers, and they thought industrial policy was about backing winners or subsidizing losers. This political resistance is another challenge.\n\nSo, the key challenges would include the initial failure to get the private sector (like Chambers of Commerce) on board, leading to the government stepping in. The tension between the government's initiative and the private sector's reluctance, viewing it as an intrusion. Also, the political resistance from both sides of the spectrum. Additionally, the slow rollout due to bureaucratic processes like the National Assessment Panel and accreditation requirements.\n\nNow, the user also wants how the tension influenced development. The tension led to the government having to create Business Link themselves because the private sector didn't cooperate. The political resistance might have influenced the need for Heseltine to present his case to backbenchers, possibly shaping the policy's direction. Also, the requirement for Business Links to generate income from outside the government might be a result of the need to show self-sufficiency, possibly due to private sector and political pushback.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the initial challenges, the unsuccessful meetings with the Chambers (S26-S34), the slow progress (S35-S38), and the political resistance (S21-S25). The tension between government and private sector is covered in S26-S34, where Heseltine talks about the Chambers seeing it as an intrusion. The political resistance is in S21-S25.\n\nSo, structuring the answer: first, the key challenges are the failed collaboration with the private sector (Chambers of Commerce), leading to government intervention. Then, the slow rollout due to bureaucratic hurdles. The tension between government and private sector caused the government to take over, and political resistance influenced the need for self-sustaining models.\n\nI need to check if all the citations are correctly attributed. For example, the part about the Chambers not cooperating is S26-S34. The political resistance is S21-S25. The slow rollout is S35-S38. Also, the part where Heseltine says the Chambers should have done it themselves is S28-S31. \n\nSo, the answer should mention the initial challenges as the failed private sector collaboration, bureaucratic hurdles, and political resistance. The tension led to government taking over and shaping the program's structure, like the accreditation requirements and the need for self-sufficiency."

[S2] It consisted of an online portal managed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline. [S3] The service's network of local and regional advisors (under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) was axed in 2011. [S4] The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012, although migration of all services to Gov.uk branding took several years and the telephone helpline was retained for some time. [S5] This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988. [S6] ## Origins and launch\n\nThe concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry. [S7] The initiative was at first referred to as \"One Stop Shop\", and was launched as Business Link in December 1992. [S8] It replaced a number of services which were considered to be fragmented, such as the Department of Employment's 'Small business development service'. [S9] At the time, research led the government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. [S10] These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for the new service. [S11] Previously, the Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. [S12] This government-funded scheme was designed to encourage take-up of external advice (consultancy) by small businesses, by offering grant incentives. [S13] During this three-year period \u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S14] applications were received from 135,700 businesses. [S15] A Wren and Storey report concluded that \u00a31,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by \u00a330,000 and created a new job. [S16] An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take-up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. [S17] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S18] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S19] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S20] We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\"\n\n\n### Resistance\n\nDespite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded \"one stop shop\" immediately hit political resistance. [S21] Reflecting on this period in 2011, Heseltine stated that \"you would have the left wing, which wouldn't have any real interest in effective management of the capitalist system. [S22] And you would have a very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. [S23] In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative back benchers so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. [S24] What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the transition of Business Link services to regional development agencies in 2005 and its effects on the program's structure and service delivery implications.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant parts of the supporting context. The passage mentions that in 2005, administration was transferred to regional development agencies (RDAs), who contracted services to private companies. That's in Passage 1, sentence S42. So the transition involved shifting administration to RDAs, which then outsourced to private firms. \n\nNext, how did this affect the structure? The original structure had regional offices with advisors, but after 2005, the RDAs took over. The passage doesn't explicitly say the structure changed, but the shift in administration might imply a different management structure. However, the context doesn't go into detail about structural changes beyond the transfer. So maybe the structure remained similar but with RDAs managing it instead of the DTI.\n\nFor service delivery implications, the RDAs chose to contract out to private companies. This could mean changes in how services are delivered, possibly more\u5e02\u573a\u5316 or different service models. But the context doesn't specify if this led to improvements or issues. The implications might include potential differences in service quality or accessibility, but the given text doesn't provide details on outcomes. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that mention implications. The passage talks about the RDAs funding the regional network and using the IDBT model, but that's before 2005. After 2005, the main point is the transfer and contracting out. There's no direct info on implications, so maybe the answer is based on the transfer itself. \n\nSo the answer would state that the transition in 2005 moved administration to RDAs, who then contracted services to private companies. The structure might have shifted from direct government management to a more decentralized model with private contractors. However, the context doesn't elaborate further, so the citations would be S42. But wait, the user might need more details. Let me check again. \n\nThe original structure had regional offices under DTI, and after 2005, RDAs took over. The service delivery implications could be that contracting out might have changed the approach, but the text doesn't specify. So the answer is based on the given info, citing S42. Also, maybe the fact that RDAs used the IDBT model, but that's in S53, which is about the regional network. However, the transition in 2005 is specifically mentioned in S42. \n\nTherefore, the answer should mention the transfer to RDAs and contracting to private companies, citing S42. Since there's no further info on implications, that's the main point."

[S51] ## Services\n\n\n### Regional network\n\nBusiness Link's face-to-face service operated on a regional basis across England and was funded by the relevant regional development agencies (RDAs). [S52] The service used an IDBT (information, diagnostic, brokerage and transaction) model to advise businesses. [S53] Regional Business Links ran a variety of events and workshops on topical issues and general business skills.",
        "[S1] Business Link\n\n\n# Business Link\n\n\n\n**Business Link** was a government-funded business advice and guidance service established in England in 1992. [S2] It consisted of an online portal managed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline. [S3] The service's network of local and regional advisors (under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) was axed in 2011. [S4] The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012, although migration of all services to Gov.uk branding took several years and the telephone helpline was retained for some time. [S5] This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988. [S6] ## Origins and launch\n\nThe concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry. [S7] The initiative was at first referred to as \"One Stop Shop\", and was launched as Business Link in December 1992. [S8] It replaced a number of services which were considered to be fragmented, such as the Department of Employment's 'Small business development service'. [S9] At the time, research led the government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. [S10] These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for the new service. [S11] Previously, the Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. [S12] This government-funded scheme was designed to encourage take-up of external advice (consultancy) by small businesses, by offering grant incentives. [S13] During this three-year period \u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S14] applications were received from 135,700 businesses. [S15] A Wren and Storey report concluded that \u00a31,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by \u00a330,000 and created a new job. [S16] An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take-up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. [S17] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S18] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S19] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S20] We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\"\n\n\n### Resistance\n\nDespite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded \"one stop shop\" immediately hit political resistance. [S21] Reflecting on this period in 2011, Heseltine stated that \"you would have the left wing, which wouldn't have any real interest in effective management of the capitalist system. [S22] And you would have a very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. [S23] In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative back benchers so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. [S24] What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers. [S25] Now I wasn't in favour of certainly the latter, but once I had done the presentations, I had no complaints.\""

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the reasons for the discrepancy between Business Link's stated mission to assist all businesses and the concerns from the Institute of Directors about its focus on SMEs. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that the Institute of Directors was worried about the focus on growth businesses (SMEs) potentially hurting smaller businesses and startups. But the passage also states that businesses of all sizes could access Business Link services from the start (S45). However, there's a contradiction here.\n\nLooking at the DTI directive, there's a mention that Business Links had to generate 25% of their income from outside central government within five years, with the advice to target end consumers (S48). This might have pushed Business Links to focus on growth-oriented businesses, which are more likely to pay or be viable clients. The PBAs were supposed to work with these growth-oriented businesses, but it was hard to enforce (S49). \n\nAlso, the original mission was to help all businesses, but the practical implementation might have been influenced by financial requirements. The DTI's directive could have led to a de facto focus on SMEs because they were seen as the main source of income. Additionally, the PBAs were recruited from business owners, which might have biased their approach towards businesses they could relate to, possibly SMEs.\n\nSo the reasons cited in the context are the DTI's financial requirements pushing towards growth-oriented businesses and the difficulty in enforcing the focus on all businesses. The Institute of Directors' concern was about the potential neglect of smaller businesses, even though the service was technically available to all. The citations needed would be S48 and S49, maybe S45 as well. Let me check the exact sentences.\n\nYes, S48 mentions the DTI directive requiring 25% income from outside government, advising to target end consumers. S49 says PBAs wanted to work with growth-oriented businesses but it was hard to enforce. Also, S45 states that all businesses could access services, but the reality might have been different. So the answer would link these points."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key factors that led to the abolition of the regional business adviser programs by the Cameron-Clegg coalition, even though Business Link had positive evaluations and their national website and helpline continued.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me scan through the sentences. \n\nStarting from the beginning, the passage mentions that Business Link was evaluated positively, but some commentators were worried about the cost and variability of advice. There's a mention of some Business Links being more successful with a focused approach, while others spread themselves thin. Then, it says that the regional advisory service was abolished along with regional development agencies, but the website and helpline continued. \n\nThe key part here is the sentence that says, \"Despite the evidence that the advisers were the most effective part of Business Link, the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, elected in 2010, declared their intention to abolish the regional business adviser programmes.\" That's sentence S70. So the coalition decided to abolish them even though there was evidence of effectiveness. \n\nBut why? The passage mentions that the coalition wanted to replace them with Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs). Also, there's a note about the cost of Business Link. In sentence S56, it says some commentators worried about the cost. Additionally, the closure section mentions that the website was replaced in 2012, but the national services continued. \n\nSo the factors might include cost concerns, the desire to shift responsibility to LEPs, and possibly the variability in the effectiveness of different Business Links. The coalition might have thought that LEPs would be more efficient or better suited for regional economic growth. Also, the fact that the national website continued suggests that the government still saw value in the online services but not the regional advisers. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that mention reasons. The passage also mentions that Business Link companies competed with the private sector and ACAS, but that might not be directly related. The evaluations showed that users of Business Link were more likely to use private consultants, which might indicate that the government thought private sector involvement was better, but that's speculative. \n\nThe main citations would be S70 for the abolition decision, S56 for cost concerns, and S61 for the replacement with LEPs. Also, maybe S54 and S55 for the positive evaluations, but the question is about why they were abolished despite that. So the answer should focus on the reasons given in the passage, like cost, variability, and the shift to LEPs. \n\nSo the key factors are the cost of the program, the variability in the effectiveness of different regional offices, and the decision to replace them with Local Enterprise Partnerships. The citations would be S56 (cost and variability), S70 (coalition's decision), and S61 (LEPs taking over). The positive evaluations are mentioned in S55, but that's part of the context, not the reason for abolition. \n\nI need to structure the answer with these points and the corresponding citations."

They want to know the ways this happened, based on evaluations of the program.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage and find relevant sentences.

That's directly related to the question. Then, sentence S64 says that evaluations showed businesses taking advice from Business Link were more likely to work with private consultants afterward because they learned about the benefits of advice.

But the question specifically mentions competition with private sector and ACAS. So maybe the key points are S62 and S64. \n\nWait, the question also mentions \"as evidenced by evaluations of the program.\" So the citations should be from the evaluations. S64 is an evaluation result. S62 is a statement about their services, but is that an evaluation? The passage says \"various business link companies have engaged...\" which might be a factual statement rather than an evaluation. However, the question is about how their services (including competition) influenced engagement. The evaluation in S64 shows that after using Business Link, businesses were more likely to work with private consultants. So that's a direct influence. \n\nAre there other sentences? S63 talks about provision of employment law advice via cold calling, etc., but that's more about how they provided services, not the impact on engagement. S55 is about positive impacts, but not specifically about competition. \n\nSo the main points are: \n\n1. Business Link competed with private sector and ACAS (S62).\n2. Evaluations showed that businesses who used Business Link were more likely to engage with private consultants (S64).\n\nTherefore, the answer should connect these two points, citing S62 and S64. Let me check if there are other sentences. S56 mentions concerns about cost and variability, but that's not directly about engagement. S57 and S58 talk about different models, but not the competition aspect. \n\nSo the answer would be that Business Link's competition with private sector and ACAS (S62) led to businesses being more likely to engage with private consultants after receiving advice (S64).

    "[S1] Business Link\n\n\n# Business Link\n\n\n\n**Business Link** was a government-funded business advice and guidance service established in England in 1992. [S2] It consisted of an online portal managed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline. [S3] The service's network of local and regional advisors (under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) was axed in 2011. [S4] The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012, although migration of all services to Gov.uk branding took several years and the telephone helpline was retained for some time. [S5] This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988. [S6] ## Origins and launch\n\nThe concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry. [S7] The initiative was at first referred to as \"One Stop Shop\", and was launched as Business Link in December 1992. [S8] It replaced a number of services which were considered to be fragmented, such as the Department of Employment's 'Small business development service'. [S9] At the time, research led the government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. [S10] These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for the new service. [S11] Previously, the Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. [S12] This government-funded scheme was designed to encourage take-up of external advice (consultancy) by small businesses, by offering grant incentives. [S13] During this three-year period \u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S14] applications were received from 135,700 businesses. [S15] A Wren and Storey report concluded that \u00a31,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by \u00a330,000 and created a new job. [S16] An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take-up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. [S17] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S18] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S19] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S20] We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\"\n\n\n### Resistance\n\nDespite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded \"one stop shop\" immediately hit political resistance. [S21] Reflecting on this period in 2011, Heseltine stated that \"you would have the left wing, which wouldn't have any real interest in effective management of the capitalist system. [S22] And you would have a very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. [S23] In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative back benchers so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. [S24] What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers. [S25] Now I wasn't in favour of certainly the latter, but once I had done the presentations, I had no complaints.\"",
    "[S26] Initially, Heseltine approached the private sector to deliver a Business Link type service, specifically the British Chambers of Commerce. [S27] However, these meetings were unsuccessful. [S28] The reasons for this failure are disputed, however Heseltine stated that Chambers \"should have set up this combined advisory service. [S29] They should have gone to Government and said, look you've got all these services, work with us and create the one stop shop. [S30] That's what they should have done. [S31] We did it for them. [S32] I think they regarded Business Link as an intrusion into their fiefdom. [S33] But the reason we created Business Link was because the Chambers weren't doing a good enough job. [S34] So there was tension there from the beginning.\"\n\n\n### Creation and evolution of the network\n\nThe Department of Trade (DTI) predicted 54 Business Links would launch by the end of 1993. [S35] Progress was much slower than anticipated due to each bidder and proposal having to be evaluated by a National Assessment Panel. [S36] Achieving and maintaining the ISO 9001 Quality Management Standard and Investors in People accreditation was a mandatory requirement, and each successful Business Link operator was granted a three-year license. [S37] By the end of 1993 (during which time the government spent some \u00a33m on the programme), only three branches of the service had been formed. [S38] The first opened in Leicester on 27 September 1993, with others following in Birmingham and Congleton. [S39] Halfway through 1994 only 21 Business Link operators were in place. [S40] At the end of 1996 the national roll-out was complete.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 At its peak, Business Link operated through 89 regional offices employing 650 personal business advisors. [S41] In 2005, administration of Business Link services was transferred to the regional development agencies, who mostly chose to contract business support out to private companies. [S42] ### Reception\n\nThe Business Link network employed personal business advisors (PBAs), who worked primarily with businesses that employed between 10 and 249 people (small and medium sized enterprises). [S43] In February 1996, the Institute of Directors published a research paper stating that their members were worried about the declared focus on growth businesses employing between 10 and 249, because this might hurt smaller businesses and disadvantage start ups. [S44] However, contrary to popular belief at the time, businesses of all sizes were able to access Business Link services from the start. [S45] In November 1996, Richard Page, the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy, stated in the House of Commons that he was \"disturbed to hear that the impression has been given that we are not there to help all businesses irrespective of size. [S46] My clear message is that Business Link is there to help any business man or woman, irrespective of size of company, because from little acorns grow the big oak trees\". [S47] This contradiction may be explained by the DTI directive requiring the individual new Business Link partnerships to generate at least 25% of their income from outside central government within five years of launch, with the express advice that the most likely source would be the end consumers. [S48] As a result, the Business Links wanted their PBAs to work with growth-oriented businesses but this proved difficult to enforce and implement. [S49] PBAs were recruited from those who ran businesses. [S50] At first some were self-employed earning commission but this did not prove to be self-sustaining. [S51] ## Services\n\n\n### Regional network\n\nBusiness Link's face-to-face service operated on a regional basis across England and was funded by the relevant regional development agencies (RDAs). [S52] The service used an IDBT (information, diagnostic, brokerage and transaction) model to advise businesses. [S53] Regional Business Links ran a variety of events and workshops on topical issues and general business skills.",
    "[S54] The service was evaluated on a number of occasions. [S55] These assessments generally found positive impacts of Business Link on companies that received advice. [S56] However, some commentators worried about the cost of Business Link and the variability of advice. [S57] Some of the Business Links were chosen to provide more intensive support to fewer companies and these seemed to do comparatively well. [S58] Other Business Links showed less success with a 'spreading the jam thinly' model. [S59] The Business Link regional advisory service offered advice and support to businesses until November 2011. [S60] It was then abolished along with the regional development agencies, although the Business Link website and the national helpline continued to operate. [S61] Local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) were expected to drive regional economic growth in the absence of the Business Link regional advisory service. [S62] Various business link companies have engaged in direct competition with the private sector and with governmental organisations such as ACAS. [S63] This includes the provision of employment law advice direct to businesses via cold calling, mail shots, emails and their websites. [S64] However, evaluations of Business Link showed that those taking advice from Business Link were thereafter more likely to work with private consultants as they learned about the benefits of advice. [S65] ### Website\n\nThe Business Link website was launched in May 2004 as part of the Transformational Government programme (an initiative to consolidate UK government websites). [S66] It was administered by the private company Serco on behalf of the government. [S67] In 2010 a report from the Central Office of Information found that the site's annual costs were \u00a335m, and it had around 1.2 million users. [S68] Information on the site came in the form of *guides* (pages of text information), *interactive tools* (in which businesses could get personalized information) and *transactions* (in which businesses could for example, calculate their VAT). [S69] ## Closure\n\nDespite the evidence that the advisers were the most effective part of Business Link, the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, elected in 2010, declared their intention to abolish the regional business adviser programmes. [S70] New local enterprise partnerships would take their place but the national website and telephone service would continue. [S71] The website was replaced by the Gov.uk public information website on 17 October 2012. [S72] Content was migrated to the new website, maintaining previous links to redirect users. [S73] Several online services continued, largely unchanged, for a number of years: examples included Contracts Finder (until late 2014) and the Universal Jobmatch service for employers (until at least 2016). [S74] ## Similar services\n\nBusiness Link only operated in England. [S75] The remainder of the UK still has similar regional services:\n\n* Business Gateway, Scotland\n* NIbusinessinfo.co.uk, Northern Ireland (run by Invest Northern Ireland)\n* Business Wales\n\nRegional providers used a rebranded version of the Business Link website. [S76] The Northern Ireland website retained for a time the vast majority of the Business Link website information. [S77] Most OECD countries provide similar services although they may organise them differently. [S78] Examples are the SBDC in the US and ALMI in Sweden."
